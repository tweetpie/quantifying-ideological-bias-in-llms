      "text": "Trump voters got exactly what they wanted - so why are people complaining?\n\nThis week, Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs that the Associated Press called \"a historic tax hike that could push the global order to a breaking point,\" and what I want to know is this:\n\nWhy are we still wondering what Trump voters want?\n\nHe promised. He delivered. What's the mystery?\n\nI ask, because our discourse seems to be invested in the idea that his supporters don't really want this, and I don't just mean his hardcore supporters. We tell ourselves that the last election was about inflation and the high cost of living, like the price of eggs, and that it doesn't make sense for people who voted against that to welcome it now.\n\nResolving this tension is important. The Democrats believe that if they can show Trump voters what he's going to do - how he's going to make everything more expensive - then they can get some of them to see why supporting a Democrat in the midterms is good for them.\n\nIn doing this, the Democrats assume that Trump voters are motivated by their wallets. That's understandable. The conventional wisdom is that inflation caused the electorate to burn up the incumbent party.\n\nBut the conventional wisdom also asks us to do something that we should not do and it prevents us from asking the hard questions. In effect, it treats Trump supporters as if they didn't really understand what they were getting into, and as a consequence of not truly understanding, they can't be held responsible for what they did.\n\nIt treats them like children.\n\nWe shouldn't do that.\n\nIf we treat them as adults who have their way of understanding tariffs, we might ask ourselves what's really going on, because what's really going on isn't about money, and because of that, it's harder to beat.\n\nLook at it this way.\n\nTrump supporters are going to trust him no matter how incoherent, no matter how dumb. Indeed, the dumber and more incoherent, the more they trust. His choices trigger reactions, which in turn force his people to choose between trusting everyone who says tariffs are a tax, which they are in fact or trusting Trump, who says they're a tax cut. (Evidently, the idea is that tariffs will bring such prosperity to America that the government will no longer have need for an income tax.)\n\nOver the last 10 years, Trump has swept them up in a story about the cosmic battle between good and evil, in which the chosen people, free and innocent and pure, have been taken advantage of by \"globalists\" who are trying to replace them with foreigners with the intention of \"poisoning the blood\" of the country, leading to America's destruction.\n\nOf course, this story is about a white man's country fighting to reclaim its birthright against multiracial democratic politics, which seeks to flatten the hierarchies of power. But it can be told in a way that appeals to anyone, even nonwhite people, and that's why I keep saying the challenge isn't just hardcore supporters. It's swing voters, too.\n\nLiberation requires personal sacrifice and \"short-term pain.\" So if supporters do end up recognizing that his policies are impoverishing them, they almost certainly will not attribute their suffering to him.\n\nThey will blame whomever he tells them to, including nations, as he said yesterday, that have \" looted, pillaged, raped and plundered \" the country. These foreigners are the reason he implemented tariffs in the first place, using emergency powers usually reserved for wartime.\n\nIndeed, the more Trump supporters suffer, the closer they are likely going to bind themselves to the president. Their suffering will be taken as proof of their patriotism and devotion to the cause of justice, and because their savior will be the only one who can relieve them of it.\n\nThis cosmic story about a white man's country fighting to reclaim its birthright does not make sense to those who can't or won't see the role of racism in politics. So they chock it up to just another conspiracy theory before looking for \"the real reasons\" why voters chose Trump. The Democrats, meanwhile, tend to accept this, which means their solutions to the problem are as phony as the problem itself.\n\nI'll conclude with this observation.\n\nIt could be that the last election was about money, but not in the way most people think. Fact is, the economy was booming. Inflation was down. Wages were up. Unemployment had rarely been lower. Joe Biden really did grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. And in spite of stubbornly high costs, most everyone prospered.\n\nBut that may have been the problem.\n\nIt's not that Trump voters were mad at Biden, because he didn't do enough about inflation. I think they were mad at him, because he did more than any president to expand the economic pie to include all those who are usually left behind, especially Black people.\n\nSad as it is, the fact remains that when Black Americans are doing well for themselves, too many white people in this country start feeling like something is wrong, something is being taken from them, someone somewhere is cheating them, even when they are in fact thriving. It's white-power's zero-sum. If America includes \"them,\" it excludes \"us.\"\n\nThe mainstream view used to be that the party that presided over boomtimes was the party that could expect to be rewarded. But for Trump voters who believe they are the real America, and that the real America has been \"looted, pillaged, raped and plundered,\" it's likely that boomtimes meant something else - evidence they were right.\n\nThe Democrats tend to believe they can win over some Trump voters with economic politics that are designed to be in everyone's interest. But it's because they are designed in everyone's interest that most Trump voters are unlikely to be won over. They want economic policies for them, not everyone. And if tariffs end up hurting them, they can take comfort in knowing Black people are hurting more.\n\nYes, these tariffs are the biggest tax increase of our lifetimes.\n\nBut that's what they wanted.\n\nHe promised. He delivered. No mystery.\n\nNOW READ: Why so-called men like Donald Trump are in deep trouble right now"

      "text": "Here's why Trump supporters can't see through his lies\n\nYesterday, Donald Trump signed a royal decree (ie, an executive order) claiming that the president has the legal and constitutional right to unwind and shut down the United States Department of Education.\n\nHe has no such thing, Joe Walsh reminded us . \"He can't dismantle the Department of Education,\" he said. \"He doesn't have the constitutional authority to do it. Only Congress does. He'll get sued and the courts will rule against him. This is unconstitutional. And that matters more than whatever you think about the Department of Education.\"\n\nThat is true as a matter of principle, and on the strength of federal law and the separation of powers, federal judges have this week handed down a string of rulings against the administration: its shuttering of the US Agency for International Development, its ban on trans military servicemembers and its freeze on billions in climate-change grants.\n\nBut it's less true as a matter of practice.\n\nIn the case of the Education Department, Elon Musk's \"DOGE\" has already started firing half the people who work there. Trump's executive order will be challenged and probably stopped by a court, but by then, the agency's personnel may be so demoralized, and its infrastructure so degraded, that by all intents and purposes, Trump has shut it down, though he has no constitutional authority to do so.\n\nThis pattern is being repeated again and again.\n\nThe administration does not have the legal or constitutional authority to do a thing that it wants to do - say, for instance, arresting and detaining anyone it dislikes, and deporting them Central America. But by the time the courts catch up - for instance, by holding a hearing on the arrest, detainment and deportation of anyone the administration dislikes to Central America - the crime has already been committed, the only question then being how it's going to cover up for the crime.\n\nWhich is to say, lie.\n\nIn case those lies don't work, however, the administration has another strategy. According to CNN, it plans to drag its feet in response to over 160 (and counting) lawsuits against it in the hope that the rightwing supermajority of the US Supreme Court will decide in its favor. The expectation seems to be that it will reaffirm its prior ruling, which held that the president can't commit crimes as long as he's president.\n\nAnd if that doesn't work, Trump has another strategy, which is the same as the old strategy, which is to slander and discredit any member of the judiciary who stands in his way, thus creating conditions for picking which rulings to obey and which to disregard, even perhaps decisions made by the US Supreme Court. As one former jurist, a well-known conservative, said this week, Trump has declared war on federal law. I would add that so far, that war has been one-sided.\n\nEven though the administration has so far disobeyed at least two federal judges, both of whom said it cannot deport people it dislikes without further review by the court, that does not constitute a state of emergency, according to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nIn an interview , Schumer suggested that America has not yet reached a moment of \" autocratic breakthrough ,\" as Rachel Maddow put it last month. That would come, he said, when Trump disobeys the Supreme Court, thus triggering \"a strong and immediate reaction from one end of the country to the other in ways that we have never seen before.\"\n\nHe said that if the court of law fails, the defense of democracy would move to the court of public opinion. \"The people will have to rise up,\" Schumer told MSNBC's Chris Hayes. \"Our democracy will be at stake then. If the people make their voices heard, and stand up, and we join them, I believe we can try to beat that back, we can beat that back.\"\n\nSchumer expressed the basic faith in the American people, the same basic faith that lies beneath the widespread assumption (and hope among liberals) that Trump's policies, specifically his economic policies, are going to hurt his supporters so much his poll numbers will fall, which in turn would creation conditions, as Schumer told the Times last week, for the congressional Republicans to turn on him.\n\nHowever, this basic faith greatly overestimates the power of the people to determine their own economic interests and greatly understimates the power of president's propaganda, which to say, Donald Trump's superpower, which is to say that he lies so often, so hard and so ruthlessly, and that those lies are amplified so widely and deeply by the press corps and the rightwing media, that people who are paying an extortionate price for eggs, for instance, will believe, as one Trump official said this week, that a dozen cost \"$2.50 for the whole country.\"\n\nPeople who believe the White House when it says the price of eggs is $2.50 a dozen, even as they are paying $7.50, are not the kind of people who are going to assign him blame for their suffering. And if they do not blame him, his polls numbers are unlikely to fall by much, which in turn would not creation conditions, as Schumer told the Times last week, for the congressional Republicans to finally turn on him.\n\nThe great evil unreality that Trump and his people have manufactured with their years of ruthless and malicious lying should give us pause whenever someone like Schumer says there's no doubt the American people would rise up is disgust against a president who vandalizes the federal government or openly disobeys the US Supreme Court.\n\nThat would require the American people to recognize on their own, if they do not have anyone in the Democratic Party to guide them, what a crime looks like when it's committed by a president who will lie about the crime so much and so hard that it stops looking like a crime.\n\nVandals also act outside the law, but in time, they are punished.\n\nWill Trump?"

      "text": "'Women shouldn't vote': Podcaster recalls 'shocking' encounter with Trump supporters\n\nFive days into Donald Trump's second presidency, Sam Seder - the progressive actor who has been hosting or co-hosting \"The Majority Reporter\" since 2004 - debated 20 Trump supporters during an event hosted by Jubilee Media for their \"Surrounded\" series. Seder has talked to conservatives many times over the years, but the January event was different. Seder wasn't talking to Never Trumpers he might have some common ground with, but rather, with hardcore MAGA ideologues with unapologetically far-right views.\n\nSeder described that experience during a late March appearance on the podcast \"The Last Laugh.\"\n\nThe 58-year-old Seder explained , \"I was prepared for there to be more people there who were going to be able to engage on the substance of what I was talking about, and there was not a lot of that.... One of my contentions was, unless you're a billionaire, a religious fundamentalist, or a xenophobic nationalist, you made a mistake in voting for Donald Trump . And it did not occur to me that instead of someone saying, 'Hey, I'm not a billionaire, and I'm not a theocrat, and I'm not a white nationalist, but I care about X, Y or Z, like, I'm worried about inflation' - no one came and said that.\"\n\nSome of the comments from Trump supporters, Seder noted , were even more extreme than he expected.\n\nThe \"Majority Report\" host recalled , \"Instead, what happened was, someone came down and said, 'I am a Christian theocrat, and this is why Christian theocracy is better, because I have a moral foundation for my beliefs.' And it took me longer than I would have wanted to pivot to like, 'Well, let's hear your vision of America, after you get what you want.' And it was 'women subjugated by men,' I'm not paraphrasing. That was the part that was shocking to me. Women subjugated by men, no marriage equality, no marriage for fun, essentially no birth control.\"\n\nSeder added , \"It turns out this guy, his avatar on Twitter is 'Women shouldn't vote.' It never occurred to me that someone's going to come and promote that in such a full-throated way. And then, there was a woman who followed him who came and said, 'What's wrong with xenophobic nationalism?'\"\n\nDuring his appearance on \"The Last Laugh,\" Seder was critical of the way Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom is handling his new podcast. Newsom has no problem with Seder interviewing far-right MAGA Republicans like \"War Room\" host Steve Bannon and Turning Point USA's Charlie Kirk, but he criticized the \"wrong way\" Newsom is doing it.\n\n\"I think it's perfectly fine to go and have a conversation with people,\" Seder argued , \"and I think it's perfectly fine to share a platform and whatnot. But if I have a conversation with those people, there will be absolutely zero misunderstanding or ambiguity as to where I stand in relationship to them.... And so, I'm not going to be friendly in that environment. I will be polite, but in no way does politeness require you to be chummy. And I think that's really unhealthy, because it understates the stakes that are going on in this situation.\"\n\nSeder continued, \"I mean, Charlie Kirk has said stuff on his program that, if he was on the left, Gavin Newsom would never sit with him because of how antisemitic it is. The idea that Jews have been historically sort of anti-white and that type of stuff - Gavin Newsom wouldn't be caught dead with anybody (on the left who said that). But the amount of benefit of doubt is gross.\"\n\nRead a partial transcript of Sam Seder's appearance on \"The Last Laugh\" at this Daily Beast link ."

      "text": "How long will Trump supporters put up with getting played?\n\nSupporters of Donald Trump react as Trump speaks from the Palm Beach County Convention Center, as they attend an election watch party at Maricopa County Republican Committee during the 2024 U.S. presidential election in Chandler, Arizona, U.S., November 6, 2024.\n\nA new poll from CBS News finds that most Americans agree with Trump's policies of gutting protections for women and Black people while arresting and deporting Brown people here without documentation. Roughly two-thirds of respondents called him \"tough,\" \"energetic,\" \"focused\" and \"effective.\"\n\nThey think they are free.\n\nWhite people approving of Trump's actions believe marginalizing minorities, gutting the federal government, and attacking (and suing) media outlets and reporters will help them, and some of them probably will. A return of white supremacy and the marginalization of women in the workplace and politics, for example, may produce some small benefits for a few white men.\n\nBut there's a price to be paid in what Americans like to refer to as freedom .\n\nFor Trump to continue to reverse over 100 years of progress on civil, women's, and workers' rights, he's eventually going to confront pushback from those very groups. He's going to have to deny working people their right to organize into unions. He's going to have to restrict the ability of poor and middle-class people to rise above their economic stations through education.\n\nAll of these things will eventually harm the middle class, and he's already started on every one of them.\n\nBut it's even worse than that: as our freedoms are taken away, and our government is turned into a one-party state, governance that assists the majority of the people begins to vanish. The freedom to speak out goes away. Eventually, society turns cold, as Trump's authoritarianism hardens the national Zeitgeist.\n\n- Politicians can only advance or even hold onto their offices if they unceasingly praise Dear Leader Trump. FBI agents reportedly won't get hired unless they assert that the January 6th attack on our government was \"an inside job,\" that the 2020 election was \"stolen\" from Trump, and that the \"real patriots\" on January 6th were the rioters, not the police or politicians.\n\n- Members of the media face life-destroying lawsuits if they criticize Trump or point out his successful prosecution for sexually assaulting E. Jean Carroll. Those who support Trump no matter what get elevated in the press stations at the White House and Pentagon; legitimate mainstream media that persists in occasionally telling the truth are marginalized or even kicked out of routine press conferences.\n\n- Wealthy oligarchs who support Dear Leader get tax breaks, government contracts, special legislation giving them immunities , and see the federal agencies that once regulated them gutted. Working people and consumers lose their protections through the Labor Department, the EPA, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\n- Judges, prosecutors, and reporters who challenge or expose Dear Leader's criminality are doxed, threatened, and attacked in social media , making their lives both miserable and dangerous. People who assault police and lawmakers on behalf of Dear Leader are lionized and given special status and pardons for their crimes.\n\nWe know how this usually turns out because the world has seen this movie before. In recent years, we watched it happen in Putin's Russia, Orbán's Hungary, Duterte's Philippines, Pinochet's Chile, Bukele's El Salvador, El Sisi's Egypt, Erdoğan's Turkey, Chávez's Venezuela, Lukashenko's Belarus, Ortega's Nicaragua, Prayuth's Thailand, Saied's Tunisia, and Modi's India.\n\nAlmost a century ago, we saw it played out for the first time in modern history in Spain, Japan, Italy, and Germany.\n\nAn American Jew of German ancestry and a brilliant writer, Chicago newspaper reporter Milton Mayer went to Germany seven years after Hitler's fall and befriended 10 \"average Germans,\" asking each how the Nazis rose to power in an otherwise civilized nation.\n\nHis book, They Thought They Were Free , is his story of that experience. Intertwined throughout it - first published in 1955 - are repeated overt and subtle warnings to future generations of Americans: to us, today.\n\nDoesn't the nation rise up and protest the destruction of its own democracy, Mayer wondered. Don't the people pour into the streets?\n\nA college professor he interviewed gave us the answer:\n\nWe can't say we weren't warned by our own people, our own politicians, the most senior members of our own institutional power structure. But, still, how do we know? Is there a sudden proclamation by Dear Leader that the nation is now \"officially fascist\"?\n\nBack to Mayer's German friend in 1954:\n\nAnd yet everything seems \"normal.\" After all, Dear Leader isn't coming after people who don't challenge him or his ruling clique. If you work your job, watch football, listen to music, ignore the news, and don't speak out, everything seems fine.\n\nDear Leader even attains high levels of popularity, so long as his main victims are not straight white men. By 1938, Adolf Hitler was the most popular politician in the world, as documented by TIME magazine, which put him on the cover that year.\n\nAs Mayer's professor friend told him, when Dear Leader finally seizes control of all the levers of power from political to economic to spiritual, everything changes but everything also stays the same:\n\nWe're already quite a ways down this road, which is why our democracy has been rated by numerous international groups as being \"at risk\" or similar designations.\n\nVoter suppression, gerrymandering, the proliferation of phony media selling rightwing propaganda as \"news,\" armed militias on our streets (and the GOP recruiting them for \"election monitors\"), the media bending its collective knee to Trump; these are the visible tip of the proverbial iceberg.\n\nAnd, without the benefit of a previous and recent and well-remembered fascistic regime to refer to, Mayer had to candidly answer:\n\nThat was 1954, however; this is 2025. We now know.\n\nFascism, with its promises of efficiency, order, and privileges for the racial majority is often popular in its early stages; by the time people figure out the scam, it's usually too late to stop.\n\nTrump's followers think they are free; they're not. Eventually they'll discover the high price they'll pay for supporting his growing authoritarianism.\n\nUnlike Mayer's German friends who realized too late the direction things were going, there are things we can do now .\n\nReach out to your elected representatives and demand resistance, join movements like indivisible.org , subscribe to independent media, make a donation (if you can; if you can't, call them with thanks) to politicians whenever they publicly challenge the regime.\n\nRaise hell on social media. Show up in the streets. Talk with relatives, neighbors, friends, coworkers, and acquaintances. Speak out. Be bold and brave.\n\nTragically, a series of missteps by Democrats and our media have failed our democracy. As a result, the question for today is, \"Will we stop this assault on our democracy before it's too late?\"\n\nTo a large extent, that's up to you and me...\n\nNOW READ: Rachel Maddow is wrong"

      "text": "'Raw animosity': 4 conservatives explain why MAGA voters 'want their opponents to suffer'\n\nIn the 2024, voters who helped put Donald Trump back in the White House ranged from hardcore MAGA Republicans to swing voters and independents - some of them 2020 Joe Biden voters - who blamed the Biden Administration for inflation. The economy was a major concern of Biden-to-Trump voters, and the term \"buyer's remorse\" is being used in connection with swing voters and independents who now regret voting for Trump and are worried about steep new tariffs or possible cuts to Social Security.\n\nBut diehard MAGA voters have no regrets about voting for Trump. In a conversation published by the New York Times' opinion section on March 21, four conservative columnists - David Brooks, David French, Bret Stephens and Ross Douthat - lay out some reasons why those voters continue to be diehard Trump supporters.\n\nThe writers aren't promoting Trump's policies during the conversation - French, in fact, is very much a Never Trump conservative - but rather, are explaining the president's unending appeal to his hardcore MAGA base.\n\nBrooks cited \"brokenism\" as a key reason for their support. The columnist describes \"brokenism\" as \"the idea that everything is broken and we just need to burn it all down.\"\n\nBrooks told his Times colleagues , \"Personally, I think some things are broken and some things are OK, but most of my Trump-supporting friends are brokenists. They get this from media consumption.\"\n\nFrench, who is a scathing critic of Trump but also has major complaints about the left, interjected, \"In addition to the brokenism that David talks about, there's a strong undercurrent of raw animosity in our politics. Republicans and Democrats have very negative views of each other, and many Republicans, sadly, want their opponents to suffer. They're actually happy to see people lose their jobs or to see nonprofits lose funding if those people are perceived as part of the 'deep state' or RINOs. So, yes, Republicans want a disruptive president, but who's being disrupted really matters - and if it's the government or institutions that many Republicans believe are hostile to them, then Republicans are just fine with the pain.\"\n\nFrench added , \"Many Republicans dislike foreign aid. Or loathe elite universities. Or hate big liberal law firms. Students and professors at elite universities have a long track record of targeting the free speech rights of their conservative colleagues, and Republicans are rationalizing their own constitutional violations as fighting fire with fire.\"\n\nAccording to Brooks , diehard MAGA voters enjoy seeing him target institutions they feel excluded form.\n\nBrooks told French, Douthat and Stephens , \"I'd offer up one more word for consideration: 'exclusion.' Progressives really have spent the last few decades excluding conservative and working-class voices from a lot of institutions. Trump has gone after these institutions big time - the universities, the Department of Education, the State Department. Of course, the MAGA crowd feels justified revenge.\"\n\nDouthat alluded to the fact that Trump's strongest support continues to be within the MAGA movement.\n\nDouthat told his colleagues , \"First, I would stress that Trump is not terribly popular, and undoubtedly will become less so if the stock market trends down and recession fears mount. He has a commanding position within his party, but even at his apotheosis, his approval ratings barely got over 50 percent. Second, Americans lived through the first Trump term, when sky-is-falling rhetoric was commonplace, but the average American did not experience a crisis until COVID hit.\"\n\nRead the full New York Times article at this link (subscription required)."

      "text": "Trump's poorest supporters are in for a rude awakening\n\nAn attendee wearing a hat in support of Donald Trump scrolls on their phone during the Michigan GOP's Election Night Party with Mike Rogers and Team Trump on Election Day at the Suburban Showplace in Novi, Michigan, U.S., November 5, 2024.\n\nSince the election, you have probably heard a lot about FAFO (\"f--- around and find out\"). It's the idea that voting is a choice and voters must face the consequences of their choices. If you are, say, a poor person, you shouldn't have voted for Donald Trump or any Republican, because in the end, they're going to betray you. But if you did, well, f--- around and find out.\n\nLow-income voters did indeed vote for Trump.\n\nAccording to the Post , \"50 percent of voters from families with an income of less than $50,000 a year cast their ballots for Trump, according to [exit polls], compared with 48 percent for Vice President Kamala Harris . Four years ago, President Joe Biden carried those voters by 11 percentage points; Hillary Clinton won them by 12 points in 2016 and former president Barack Obama by 22 points in 2012.\"\n\nThey're anxious now, the Post said .\n\nSome believed his promise to put them first, but the Republicans around him keep talking about cutting spending and slashing services.\n\n\"Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy - whom Trump has chosen to lead a new nongovernmental advisory panel, the 'Department of Government Efficiency' - have said they want to trim $2 trillion from the government's annual budget, a cut that some experts say could be accomplished only by slashing entitlement programs,\" the Post said .\n\nALSO READ: We're watching the largest and most dangerous 'cult' in American history\n\nThe Post continued : \"Trump's pick for White House budget director was a key architect of Project 2025, a plan drawn up by conservatives to guide his second term that calls for steep cuts to programs such as food stamps. And GOP leaders in Congress and Trump advisers are considering significant changes to Medicaid ... and other federal aid.\"\n\nLow-income supporters want him to honor his promise.\n\nThe Post report isn't alone. Since the election, I have seen many stories about Trump voters who are now concerned about what Trump is going to do - sick people who fear the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare); Latinos who fear their families being deported ; and now poor people who survive on food stamps but fear them being cut.\n\nThese stories never fail to get the attention of the FAFO crowd , which is to say, of liberals and Democrats who are still smarting from defeat.\n\nThey take some comfort in the idea that Trump voters will feel the consequences of their actions. The more literate among them might even cite HL Mencken : \"Democracy is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.\"\n\nBut the FAFO crowd is giving Donald Trump too much credit.\n\nThey assume that the Trump administration's policies and programs will affect everyone equally. They do not assume, as they should, that Trump will reward his friends and punish his enemies. If he ends up in the process looking like a hypocrite, or committing a crime, so be it.\n\nThe incoming administration is going to be fantastically corrupt. It's going to take a large, serious and sustained counteroffensive to fight against it. But we might end up underestimating the enormity of the project by continuing to focus on FAFO, as if Trump would not spare supporters from facing consequences if doing so suited his interests.\n\nHe will try if it does.\n\nEven if that means breaking the law.\n\nTake immigration. Trump vowed to deport millions of \"illegal\" workers. If successful, he'd decimate the labor supply and hurt the big farming states like Nebraska and Kansas that cannot function without \"illegal\" workers to pick their crops. Knowing that they voted for him anyway, by huge margins, the FAFO crowd is expecting them to find out.\n\nThey probably won't. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will almost certainly focus on \"illegal\" immigrants in states like New York and California, especially in cities like New York City and Los Angeles, because they voted against Trump. Meanwhile, \"illegal\" immigrants in Nebraska and Kansas will be overlooked, because it's convenient to.\n\nTake tariffs, too. Trump vowed to impose across-the-board levies on imported goods from China and elsewhere. The impact could, in effect, be as much as a 20 percent sales tax on everything from sneakers to video games. Knowing that poor people voted for Trump, because prices are too high, the FAFO crowd is expecting them to find out.\n\nAgain, they probably won't. First, Trump's tariffs will be unequal. They will depend on who's willing to bribe him and for how much. Those who won't or can't will face a levy. Those who can and will won't.\n\nAnd if tariffs make things more expensive for Trump voters, and they will, because they're inflationary, there's nothing saying Trump can't \"offer\" them a \"tax rebate\" to offset the increase. That such a thing would be illegal and unconstitutional and impossible to implement is beside the point. The point is that Trump will be fantastically corrupt.\n\nSame thing with entitlement programs - Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and the rest. The FAFO crowd is expecting Trump supporters to suffer the consequences of their choices. If they didn't want cuts to food stamps, for instance, they shouldn't have voted for a Republican.\n\nBut they do want cuts, not for them but those who don't \"deserve\" them, which is to say, people who are not like them. This is clear when you read the Post report carefully, especially quotes from the \"longtime Democrat\" who \"struggled over whether to vote for Trump.\" She \"kept coming back to the conclusion that Trump would put Americans like her first and improve her economic prospects \" (my italics).\n\n\"We helped get you in office; please take care of us,\" she told the Post .\n\n\"Please don't cut the things that help the most vulnerable.\"\n\nYou're not vulnerable if you're not one of them.\n\nTrump won't help, because he never put you first.\n\nNOW READ: It's time for liberals to abandon MSNBC's 'sweet little lies'"

      "text": "'It can happen here': MAGA expert explains why Trump voters want to destroy Dept. of Education\n\n\"And one other thing I'll be doing very early in the administration is closing up the Department of Education.\"\n\nDonald Trump made this promise in a Sept. 13, 2023, campaign statement and repeated it frequently on the campaign trail .\n\nTrump tried to make this long-standing pledge a reality on March 20, 2025, by signing an executive order that he said will \"begin eliminating the federal Department of Education once and for all.\"\n\nTrump said that he hopes Democrats would support his executive order . \"I hope they're going to be voting for it,\" said Trump, speaking from the White House in front of a group of children seated at desks. \"Because ultimately it may come before them.\"\n\nProject 2025 , the conservative think tank Heritage Foundation's blueprint for the Trump administration, provides detailed recommendations for closing the Education Department , which was created by an act of Congress in 1979.\n\nThe Department of Education already announced on March 9 that it laid off more than 1,300 of its 4,100 employees .\n\nTrump's new executive order calls for Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to \" take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure (of) the Department of Education and return education authority to the States, while continuing to ensure the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely,\" according to a White House statement distributed to media.\n\nI am an anthropologist and have been studying U.S. political culture for years. During Trump's first presidency, I wrote a book about the extremist far right called \" It Can Happen Here \". Since then, I have continued to study the Make America Great Again, or MAGA, movement , seeking to understand it, as the anthropological expression goes, \" from the native's point of view .\"\n\nEducation policies in the U.S. are largely carried out at the state and local levels. The Education Department is a relatively small government agency, which as late as February 2025 had just over 4,000 employees  and a US$268 billion annual budget . A large part of its work is overseeing $1.6 trillion in federal student loans as well as grants for K-12 schools.\n\nAnd it ensures that public schools comply with federal laws that protect vulnerable students, like those with disabilities.\n\nWhy, then, does Trump want to eliminate the department?\n\nA will to fight against so-called \"wokeness\" and a desire to shrink the government are among the four reasons I have found.\n\nFirst and foremost, Trump and his supporters believe that liberals are ruining public education by instituting what they call a \n\" radical woke agenda \" that they say prioritizes identity politics and politically correct groupthink at the expense of the free speech of those, like many conservatives, who have different views.\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion , or DEI, initiatives promoting social justice - and critical race theory, or the idea that racism is entrenched in social and legal institutions - are a particular focus of MAGA ire.\n\nSo, too, is what Trump supporters call \" radical gender ideology ,\" which they contend promotes policies like letting transgender students play on school sports teams or use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, not biological sex.\n\nTrump supporters say that such policies - which the Education Department indirectly supported by expanding Title IX gender protections in 2024 to include discrimination based on gender identity - are at odds with parental school choice rights or, for some religious conservatives, the Bible.\n\nRace and gender policies are highlighted in Project 2025 and in the 2024 GOP's \"Make America Great Again!\" party platform.\n\nTrump has repeatedly promised, as he did on Aug. 14, 2024, in North Carolina, to \"keep critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our schools.\"\n\nFor MAGA supporters, \" radical left \" wokeness is part of liberals' long-standing attempt to \" brainwash \" others with their allegedly Marxist views that embrace communism.\n\nOne version of this \" American Marxism \" conspiracy theory argues that the indoctrination dates to the origins of U.S. public education . MAGA stalwarts say this alleged leftist agenda is anti-democratic and anti-Christian.\n\nSaying he wants to combat the educational influence of such radicals, zealots and Marxists , Trump issued executive orders on Jan. 29 that pledge to fight \" campus anti-Semitism \" and to end \" Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schools .\"\n\nTrump supporters also argue that \"woke\" federal public education policy infringes on people's basic freedoms and rights.\n\nThis idea extends to what Trump supporters call \" restoring parental rights ,\" including the right to decide whether a child undergoes a gender transition or learns about nonbinary gender identity at public schools.\n\nThe first paragraph of Project 2025's chapter on education argues, \" Families and students should be free to choose from a diverse set of school options and learning environments.\"\n\nDiversity, according to this argument, should include faith-based institutions and homeschooling. Project 2025 proposes that the government could support parents who choose to homeschool or put their kids in a religious primary school by providing Educational Savings Accounts and school vouchers . Vouchers give public funding for students to attend private schools and have been expanding in use in recent years.\n\nCritics of school vouchers, like the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers unions, argue that vouchers would diminish public education for vulnerable students by taking away scarce funding .\n\nTrump has already issued a Jan. 29 executive order called \" Expanding Educational Freedom and Educational Opportunity for Families ,\" which opens the door to expanded use of vouchers . This directly echoes Project 2025 by directing the Education Department to prioritize educational choice to give families a range of options.\n\nFor the MAGA faithful, the Education Department exemplifies government inefficiency and red tape.\n\nProject 2025 , for example, contends that from the time it was established by the Carter administration in 1979, the Education Department has ballooned in size, come under the sway of special interest groups and now serves as an inefficient \" one-stop shop for the woke education cartel .\"\n\nTo deal with the Education Department's \"bloat\" and \"suffocating bureaucratic red tape ,\" Project 2025 recommends shifting all of the department's federal programs and money to other agencies and the states.\n\nThese recommendations dovetail with Trump's broader attempt to eliminate what he and his MAGA supporters consider wasteful spending and deregulate the government.\n\nTrump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 that establishes a \" Department of Government Efficiency \" headed by billionaire Elon Musk. Musk said on Feb. 4 that Trump \"will succeed\" in dismantling the Education Department.\n\nTrump's executive order shuttering the Department of Education will almost certainly spark legal challenges in court.\n\nRepublican Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota also introduced a bill in November 2024 to close the department.\n\nTrump has dismantled other government agencies in his second term, chiefly the U.S. Agency for International Development , without the required congressional approval. A federal judge ruled on March 18 that the dismantling of USAID likely violated the Constitution and ordered the Trump administration to restore all USAID employees' email and computer access.\n\nAbolishing the Department of Education would legally require congressional approval and 60 votes to move forward in the Senate , which is unlikely since Republicans only have 53 seats.\n\nRegardless of such legal challenges , Trump's March 20 executive order will further weaken the Department of Education even as it remains in the crosshairs.\n\nThis story was updated on March 20, 2025, from an earlier version published originally on Feb. 7, 2025.\n\nAlex Hinton , Distinguished Professor of Anthropology; Director, Center for the Study of Genocide and Human Rights, Rutgers University - Newark\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Trump supporters finally finding out why you shouldn't vote for a criminal corporate raider\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump looks on as Jerome Powell, his nominee to lead the U.S. Federal Reserve, speaks at the White House in Washington, U.S., November 2, 2017.\n\nYesterday, the Medicaid payment portal was shut down in all 50 states; they came back up when a federal judge put Trump's illegal impoundment of federal funds on hold until February 3rd.\n\nAnd it wasn't just Medicaid. The Trump administration shut down Pell grants, federally supported student loans, veterans homeless shelters, veterans suicide prevention programs, school meals, home heating assistance, housing assistance, food stamps, food for women and infants, childcare, Headstart, child abuse investigations, rape crisis centers, and hundreds of other programs.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause Trump is trying to gut the federal government the same way Mitt Romney gutted Clear Channel when I did my show from one of their studios a decade ago.\n\nRomney's company did it to shut down Air America and then extract the millions in wealth Clear Channel had, before throwing the husk of the company into bankruptcy; Trump is tearing our systems of governance apart because he and his billionaire buddies are offended by the idea of paying taxes to help the American middle class and the poor.\n\nIn the process, Trump is also breaking multiple laws and daring Congress and the courts to do anything about it. This is the beginning of the path to both economic chaos and dictatorship.\n\nBut first, let's take a look at what Trump and his billionaire funders are up to and why.\n\nBack in 1980, David Koch ran for vice president on a platform of shutting down virtually every federal function except the military and the court system. Some billionaires, you see, hate paying taxes and many of them think that all those \"gummint\" programs are both unnecessary and wasteful.\n\nHis platform included a whole series of positions that were specifically designed to roll back and gut FDR's \"big government\" programs (along with those added on by both Nixon and LBJ's Great Society) that had created and then sustained America's 20th century middle class:\n\n- \"We urge the repeal of federal campaign finance laws, and the immediate abolition of the despotic Federal Election Commission. - \"We favor the abolition of Medicare and Medicaid programs. - \"We oppose any compulsory insurance or tax-supported plan to provide health services, including those which finance abortion services. - \"We also favor the deregulation of the medical insurance industry. - \"We favor the repeal of the fraudulent, virtually bankrupt, and increasingly oppressive Social Security system. Pending that repeal, participation in Social Security should be made voluntary. - \"We propose the abolition of the governmental Postal Service. - \"We oppose all personal and corporate income taxation, including capital gains taxes. - \"We support the eventual repeal of all taxation. - \"As an interim measure, all criminal and civil sanctions against tax evasion should be terminated immediately. - \"We support repeal of all law which impede the ability of any person to find employment, such as minimum wage laws. - \"We advocate the complete separation of education and State. Government schools lead to the indoctrination of children and interfere with the free choice of individuals. Government ownership, operation, regulation, and subsidy of schools and colleges should be ended. - \"We condemn compulsory education laws ... and we call for the immediate repeal of such laws. - \"We support the repeal of all taxes on the income or property of private schools, whether profit or non-profit. - \"We support the abolition of the Environmental Protection Agency.\" - \"We support abolition of the Department of Energy. - \"We call for the dissolution of all government agencies concerned with transportation, including the Department of Transportation. - \"We demand the return of America's railroad system to private ownership. We call for the privatization of the public roads and national highway system. - \"We specifically oppose laws requiring an individual to buy or use so-called 'self-protection' equipment such as safety belts, air bags, or crash helmets. - \"We advocate the abolition of the Federal Aviation Administration. - \"We advocate the abolition of the Food and Drug Administration. - \"We support an end to all subsidies for child-bearing built into our present laws, including all welfare plans and the provision of tax-supported services for children. - \"We oppose all government welfare, relief projects, and 'aid to the poor' programs. All these government programs are privacy-invading, paternalistic, demeaning, and inefficient. The proper source of help for such persons is the voluntary efforts of private groups and individuals. - \"We call for the privatization of the inland waterways, and of the distribution system that brings water to industry, agriculture and households. - \"We call for the repeal of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. - \"We call for the abolition of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. - \"We support the repeal of all state usury laws.\"\n\nIn other words, gut the federal government the same way Mitt Romney's company gutted Clear Channel. But in politics and governance, it's called libertarianism, which is the hot new philosophy for Silicon Valley tech bro billionaires.\n\nThe \"Project 2025\" plan put together by the Heritage Foundation (funded in part for years by the Koch brothers' network) was a 21st century cleaned-up version of Koch's 1980 Libertarian Party platform. And now we're seeing it put into place, one step at a time.\n\nLike Romney stripping the liberal talk radio network out of Clear Channel, they are now stripping the 20th century out of our laws and policies.\n\nIt's why Republicans are working so hard to disempower women in the workplace, starting with eliminating their control over their own reproductive capacity.\n\nIt's also why they're doing everything they can to shut down corporate Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs nationwide; the majority of the hiring and increased pay benefits coming from corporate, government, and academic DEI programs go to women , a situation Republican men find intolerable.\n\nRepublicans want to either \"return\" to a pre-Civil War understanding of the Constitution (as advocated by Clarence Thomas and Sam Alito) or embrace Russell Vought's \"post-constitutional\" order, in which the last century's \"innovations\" (including the income tax, women's suffrage, \"welfare\" programs, entitlements, and even free public school and college) are dialed back.\n\nWe also see this in the ways the Republicans on the Supreme Court have gutted both the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, how they've stripped most of the teeth out of the 1935 National Labor Relations Act, and how they're working to castrate most regulatory agencies including the EPA, FTC, and even the IRS.\n\nRepublicans are trying to do to our government, in other words, what corporate raiders do to companies.\n\nSome of it is simple greed: as the middle class shrinks and poverty grows, the cash stash at the very top of the American economic pyramid grows exponentially.\n\nOther American oligarchs follow the teachings of Russell Kirk , William F. Buckley, and Ronald Reagan who all argued that a larger-than-50% middle class is a threat to the stability of the nation.\n\nThe simple reality is that nations without a large and active federal government providing protections and services to its people never develop large middle classes.\n\nUnregulated capitalism always produces the kind of nation Charles Dickens wrote about in Christmas Carol and his many other novels: A tiny 1% who own most wealth; a small 3-5% middle class of doctors, lawyers, and small business owners (Ebeneezer Scrooge); and a massive 90%+ class of the working poor (Bob Cratchit).\n\nEver since the 1950s when Russell Kirk wrote his manifesto The Conservative Mind , a small cabal of Republicans and billionaires have argued that FDR's \"big government\" programs - that moved America from being 10% middle class in the 1930s to over 60% when Reagan came into office in 1981 (it's under 50% now) - were dangerous.\n\nAs I detail in The Hidden History of American Oligarchy , their argument was largely based on the turmoil of the 1960s, when women, Blacks, and young people were demanding rights; they worried that these protests could lead to the destruction of our republic and a \"communist takeover.\"\n\nNowadays most rightwing billionaires have largely abandoned that argument, simply asserting their disgust at having to pay taxes to support programs that primarily benefit \"the little people.\"\n\nAnd then, of course, there are those in the GOP who simply hate America because of its pluralism and diversity.\n\nMost recently, Trump proved his commitment to fulfill their and Putin's desire to see America's government destroyed by sending an email to 2 million federal employees offering them 8 months pay if they'll resign.\n\nJust like when I was at Clear Channel and Romney's company fired or laid off more than half of the employees here in Portland.\n\nIn the process of disemboweling our federal government, however, Trump is taking it a step farther and breaking multiple laws:\n\n- The Impoundment Control Act, which was passed in the 1970s after Nixon withheld funding for programs he didn't like, including the Clean Water Act, Public Housing projects, the elementary and Secondary Education Act that funded public schools in poor districts, school desegregation efforts, mass transit programs for cities, and health research and healthcare programs for low-income people.\n\nThe law says that presidents cannot refuse to spend money appropriated by Congress without the explicit permission of both the House and Senate, and requires him to give them 45 days to consider the impoundment or rescission of funds.\n\nOur lawless, convicted-criminal president is nakedly breaking this law and daring Congress and the courts to do something about it.\n\n- The Pendleton Civil Service Act of 1883 and the Civil Service Reform Act guarantee that federal government employees can't be fired for \"retaliation\" or political reasons; there must be actual evidence that they are not doing their jobs, doing them poorly, or behaving in ways that justify the firing.\n\nWhen Trump fired all the career prosecutors and lawyers in the Justice Department who'd participated in his prosecution, it was a clear case of political retaliation and a clear violation of the law.\n\nOur lawless, convicted-criminal president is nakedly breaking this law and daring Congress and the courts to do something about it.\n\n- The Inspector General Act of 1978 (also responding to Nixon's corruption) mandates that the president must notify Congress at least 30 days before removing an IG and provide detailed, case-specific reasons for the dismissal. Inspectors General are the watchdogs for federal agencies, keeping an eye out for people within those agencies committing fraud, stealing funds, or engaging in illegal favoritism or bribery, among other crimes.\n\nFiring them is like a police department firing its Internal Affairs department that looks into corrupt cops. It sets up every federal agency affected by the firings to be corrupted by the Trump cronies put in charge of them. Even Republican Senator Chuck Grassley is furious about this.\n\nOur lawless, convicted-criminal president is nakedly breaking this law, too, as he raids our government, and is daring Congress and the courts to do something about it.\n\nAs Alexandrian Ocasio-Cortez noted on social media yesterday:\n\nTrump's defiance of these three major laws (along with a few others ) in the first two weeks of his presidency - and the GOP's acquiescence to his criminality - are terrible signs for the future of American democracy.\n\nThey are frankly even more dangerous than his corporate raider-like efforts to bring the American government to its knees.\n\nWhile most Americans who voted for Trump probably knew he was a convicted criminal, it's unlikely they also thought he'd commit crimes in office that would gut the protections and programs that so many of them need. They f----- around and now they're finding out.\n\nSadly, they're taking the rest of us with them...\n\nNOW READ: CNN host has a message for working-class voters ditching the Dems"

      "text": "'Delusional mythology': Hard lessons ahead for Trump supporters because they don't understand capitalism\n\nDuring the United States' 2024 presidential race, Donald Trump hammered President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris mercilessly on the economy - especially inflation, which he blamed the Biden Administration for. And his messaging worked: Trump, who won the popular vote by roughly 1.5 percent ( according to the Cook Political Report ), returned to the White House for a second term on Monday, January 20, 2025.\n\nRich Logis - the former Republican and ex-Trump supporter who founded the group Leaving MAGA - examines that economic angst in an think piece published by Salon on January 26. And he argues that many Trump supporters suffer from \"an all-enveloping misunderstanding of American capitalism.\"\n\n\"One delusional mythology about American capitalism that has been instilled in We the People is that we somehow have a guaranteed right to prosperity,\" Logis writes . \"This imaginary right has been deployed by politicians who are afraid of educating their constituents about how our model of commerce actually works.... With due respect to the many Americans who voted for Donald Trump, their overwhelming sense of entitlement dwarfs that of the hard-working immigrants who cut their grass, scrub pots and pans in the restaurants they frequent, and care for their kids and elderly loved ones.\"\n\nLogis adds , \"Too many Americans have come to believe they are owed financial comfort and material abundance, not to mention eggs and gasoline at predictable prices.... Welcome to capitalism, a system whose proponents always cite unequal outcomes as a reason for extolling it.\"\n\nLogis argues that \"many millions\" of Americans \"are better off\" because of former President Joe Biden's administration, which \"oversaw the recovery of millions of jobs lost during the COVID pandemic and the creation of millions more.\"\n\nThe former MAGA Republican recalls that back in 2016, Trump's \"populist campaign resonated with\" him. But he has since rejected the MAGA movement.\n\n\"Welcome to the 'laws' of supply and demand, which all of us must navigate on a daily basis,\" Logis emphasizes . \"If you don't know or don't remember these details, ask yourself why you don't. If you're a Trump voter, then ask yourself whether you might have voted differently in November had you been aware.... What do Trump voters, and especially true believers in the MAGA community, of which I was once a full member, think capitalism is?\"\n\nRich Logis' full article for Salon is available at this link ."
