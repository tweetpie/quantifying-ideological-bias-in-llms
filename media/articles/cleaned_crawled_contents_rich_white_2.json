      "text": "6 Rich White People Who Get Off on Killing African Wildlife\n\nThe Internet is ablaze with anger against Walter Palmer, the Minnesota dentist who recently killed Cecil, a beloved African lion living in Zimbabwe. So it's a good time to recall some of the more high-profile hunters who get a thrill out of gunning down African wildlife, many of them endangered or threatened.\n\nPalmer paid $50,000 for the privilege to kill an African lion. He lured Cecil out of a national park with food bait tied to the back of a truck, then shot him with a crossbow. Cecil survived the initial attack, but Palmer and his two guides tracked the mortally wounded lion for 40 hours, finally finishing him off with a gunshot. Little did Palmer know the animal he murdered was a local treasure who wore a radio collar so that Oxford researchers could study his movements.\n\nThe world's wildlife is threatened on so many fronts - overfishing, bycatch, climate change, pollution, water scarcity, soil erosion, deforestation, illegal wildlife trade, infrastructure development, mining, oil and gas development and habitat destruction to make room for human development. Perhaps the most explicitly despicable threat is trophy hunting: the selective killing of wild animals for the express purpose of bringing home a trophy (head, tail, horns, etc.).\n\n\"The threat of extinction is very real for African lions,\" said Philip Muruthi, senior director of conservation science at the African Wildlife Foundation. Lions are extinct in North Africa, severely depleted across West and Central Africa and are now losing ground in their strongholds of East and Southern Africa. AWF has started a Justice for Cecil fundraiser to raise money to help more endangered lions survive.\n\nThe work isn't just about stopping trophy hunting, but also reducing conflict between humans and lions. By making livestock enclosures predator-proof, for example, lions won't kill livestock and farmers won't kill lions. In addition, creating local \"lion guardian programs\" and inspiring a lion conservation ethic within rural communities can help reduce lion mortalities. According to AWF:\n\nBesides the now-infamous lion-murdering dentist, Walter Palmer, here are six other notorious trophy hunters who have been the focus of intense Internet backlash.\n\n1. Melissa Bachman\n\n[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_original\",\"fid\":\"601906\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"height\":\"644\",\"style\":\"width: 600px; height: 377px;\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\",\"width\":\"1024\"}}]]\n\nMelissa Bachman is a trophy hunter from Minnesota and host of a hardcore hunting TV show \"Winchester's Deadly Passion.\" Her show's webpage states: \"Growing up in central Minnesota, surrounded by an avid hunting family filled with love and mentors galore, Melissa's passion for hunting started at a young age. Ever since, she has pursued her many goals and taken numerous world-class animals along the way.\"\n\nIn 2013, she became the focus of an Internet backlash after she tweeted a photo of herself with a dead lion she had just killed in South Africa with the caption, \"An incredible day hunting in South Africa! Stalked inside 60-yards on this beautiful male lion...what a hunt!\" A Facebook page condemning Bachman has amassed more than 350,000 likes , while a page defending her has garnered 50,000 likes .\n\n2. Kendall Jones\n\n[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_original\",\"fid\":\"601905\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"height\":\"691\",\"style\":\"width: 600px; height: 654px;\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\",\"width\":\"634\"}}]]\n\nLast year, a teenage cheerleader from Texas named Kendall Jones sparked outrage after posting pictures of herself with dead lions, elephants, hippos and other animals on her Facebook page. The Daily Mail reported that Jones claimed her killing spree was \"a testament to her hunting skills and dedication to game preservation.\"\n\n\"The first animal I ever shot was a White Rhino with a .416 Remington!!\" Jones said on her Facebook page.\n\nThere are only 20,000 white rhinos left in the wild.\n\nA Change.org petition that originated in South Africa seeking to ban Jones from hunting in Africa garnered more than 177,000 signatures.\n\nJones' claim that hunting actually helps conservation (by eliminating infirm or problematic individuals from the herd, for example), is shared by some scientists . But the images of her smiling with her trophies does little to sway the initial disgust many feel when seeing them. These images clearly glorify violence and sanction killing animals for sport.\n\n3, 4. Eric and Donald Trump, Jr.\n\n[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_original\",\"fid\":\"601904\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"height\":\"307\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\",\"width\":\"460\"}}]]\n\nIn 2011, Donald Trump's sons Eric and Donald Jr. went to Africa to kill wild animals. Their tour company, Hunting Legends, posted images of the pair smiling with their trophies: a leopard, bull, waterbuck, crocodile and even one holding a sawed off elephant's tail next to the animal's body.\n\nPETA responded, saying, \"Like all animals, elephants, buffalo and crocodiles deserve better than to be killed and hacked apart for two young millionaires' grisly photo opportunity.\"\n\nEven Donald Sr. disapproved. He told Access Hollywood: \"I've never liked it [hunting]. I've never liked that they like it ... I'm going to talk to them about it. I'm not a fan of the whole situation.\"\n\nThe killing-happy pair defended their actions in a joint statement :\n\n5. Bob Parsons\n\n[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_original\",\"fid\":\"601903\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"height\":\"331\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\",\"width\":\"598\"}}]]\n\nAs Gawker reported in March 2011:\n\nThe incident sparked widespread outrage over the Internet, to which Parson responded: \"I kind of figured that this might happen. So be it, I'm not ashamed of what I did.\"\n\n\"I think if you had all the facts and you knew exactly what was going on and the difference it makes in these people's lives there,\" he told ABC News Radio, \"you'd feel completely different .\"\n\nSaid Iain Douglas-Hamilton, a famed elephant zoologist and the founder of Save The Elephants , following Parsons' highly publicized elephant kill, \"It's a very sad, tragic thing when elephants have to be shot. I find the glorification totally out of place .\"\n\n6. Rebecca Francis\n\n[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_original\",\"fid\":\"601909\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"height\":\"466\",\"style\":\"width: 600px; height: 451px;\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\",\"width\":\"620\"}}]]\n\nIn April, Rebecca Francis, who hosted the NBC television show \"Eye of the Hunter,\" received death threats after she posted a photo of herself lying next to a giraffe she had just killed in Africa. Comedian and animal activist Ricky Gervais responded with the tweet, \"What must've happened to you in your life to make you want to kill a beautiful animal & then lie next to it smiling?\" Francis claimed the giraffe was past breeding years and close to death. \"I chose to honor his life by providing others with his uses and I do not regret it for one second,\" she said. \"Once he was down there were people waiting to take his meat. They also took his tail to make jewelry, his bones to make other things, and did not waste a single part of him. I am grateful to be a part of something so good .\"\n\nTrophy Hunting: Is It Good or Bad for Conservation?\n\nWhile the images of rich, privileged - and usually white - Americans going to Africa to kill wild animals, many of them endangered, may be sickening to most people, the trophy hunting issue isn't so black and white.\n\nJonathan S. Adams, a conservation biologist, former program director of the Nature Conservancy's Conservation Knowledge and Communities Program and author of the book The Myth of Wild Africa: Conservation Without Illusion , unpacks the complexities of trophy hunting and how it may overlap with species conservation:\n\nLast year, Dr. Jason G. Goldman, a cognitive scientist and animal behavior researcher, wrote an article in Conservation Magazine that attempted to answer the question, \"Can trophy hunting actually help conservation?\" At the time, the Dallas Safari Club had just earned the dubious distinction of being the first organization outside of Namibia to auction off a permit to hunt and kill an endangered black rhino. He writes:\n\nGoldman is right: In the larger scope of things, wealthy hunters kill a very small number of Africa's wild animals. Poachers, on the other hand, operate on another level of killing entirely: An elephant is slaughtered every 15 minutes for its ivory. Over 40,000 elephants are killed every year, many of them leaving orphans who are too young to survive without their mothers. So where's the Internet outrage for them?"

      "text": "Drug Overdose Is Only Tragic When It Happens to a Rich White Celebrity\n\nThe death of 31-year-old \"Glee\" star Corey Monteith shocked millions of fans around the world and produced a torrent of articles examining his life and death. Monteith overdosed on a combination of heroin and alcohol.\n\nThe mainstream media treats the overdose deaths of young, white, rich celebrities in the prime of their lives as a tragedy, not something they brought on themselves or are responsible for. The British Columbia Coroners Service immediately released a statement saying, \"There is absolutely nothing at this point, no evidence to suggest this is anything but the most sad and tragic accident.\"\n\nNo articles referred to Monteith as a junkie, dope fiend, addict, drug abuser or criminal. Journalists wrote with sympathy about his troubled teen years and his struggles with addiction starting at age 13.\n\nLast year another young actor, less well known than Monteith, died from an overdose of heroin. His name was DeAndre McCullough and he played bit roles in David Simon's \"The Wire\" and \"The Corner.\" McCullough, who was black, started dealing and using drugs at the age of 15 on the streets and corners of Baltimore. Simon and co-writer Edward Burns chronicled McCullough's turbulent world in their book, The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood . But press accounts of McCullough's death didn't describe it as tragic. One headline read , \"DeAndre McCullough, Drug Dealer Who Inspired 'The Corner,' Dies at 35,\" and another proclaimed, \"A Better Life Eternally Eluded the Boy From 'The Corner.'\"\n\nMost articles frontloaded McCullough's past as a drug dealer, saying that he, like his mother and father, was an \"abuser of cocaine and heroin,\" and that just before his death warrants were out for his arrest.\n\nCory Monteith's overdose death was portrayed as a profound loss that could and should have been prevented. McCullough's death was discussed as inevitable after a long struggle with an \"addiction that won out\" or as another account put it, \"a demon inside of him that he couldn't get rid of.\" A prominent piece in the New York Times ended by declaring, \"His addiction had finally swallowed him whole.\"\n\nThe lives of McCullough and Monteith were oceans apart and show in black and white how race and class impact addiction. Most likely, Monteith had someone buy heroin for him, which allowed the well-known actor to avoid the violence of the world of illegal drugs and evade the risk of arrest, as well as all the other negative, life-long consequences of a felony drug conviction. His pay for \"Glee\" was between $30K and $50K per episode, and with personal appearances and endorsements, Monteith was a millionaire.\n\nWhen Monteith was ready to enter a drug rehabilitation program he could get in right away: No waiting lists for celebrities with cash. The war on drugs dragnet would not capture Monteith.\n\nIt was not so for McCullough. At every point his addiction was criminalized and punished. He had to score drugs the way the poor do-hustling on the streets, dealing drugs and constantly dodging beatings or bullets. Passages in The Corner describe how McCullough used his drugs in alleyways, abandoned buildings, and in shooting galleries, not in private, $500-a-night rooms at luxury hotels like Monteith did. Most likely, McCullough was uninsured, so if he wanted treatment he would have waited on a list for months. And the drug warriors who occupied his corner trained their guns on his bombed-out netherworld and eventually caught him.\n\nRacism, poverty and the criminalization of drug use set McCullough up to sell, use and to die from a heroin overdose. The 35-year-old who didn't think he'd make it past the age of 20 belongs to the most demonized, despised and disposable demographic in America: poor, black, male and addicted.\n\nBut Monteith and McCullough shared one thing; both were victims of an outdated, science-rejecting, religion-based drug treatment system that proselytizes abstinence-only 12-step fellowship, actively opposes the prescription of methadone and buprenorphine, and punishes relapse with discharge or prison.\n\nMaia Szalavitz, a columnist for the website The Fix, wrote an article on how the abstinence-only, \"tough love\" drug treatment system failed Monteith. The actor was confronted and shamed during an intervention arranged by Ryan Murphy, the co-creator of \"Glee.\" Monteith then reportedly flew to Antigua and entered Crossroads, Eric Clapton's posh and expensive ($27,000 for 29 days) drug rehab center. Szalavitz excoriated the so-called drug experts who led the intervention for evidently not discussing the option of taking methadone or buprenorphine with Monteith and instead recommended Crossroads, a 12-step program that eschews maintenance medications.\n\nIn contrast, year after year, McCullough cycled in and out of poorly funded public drug treatment programs. His short life was punctuated by stretches of abstinence and then total relapse. According to press accounts in the Baltimore Sun and the New York Times , it appears that McCullough wasn't in a methadone program nor was he prescribed buprenorphine. For someone addicted to opiates for two decades, as McCullough was, and with his consistent history of relapse, either medication should have been the first treatment choice, not abstinence. Instead, he ended up in abstinence-based, 12-step treatment programs like Mountain Manor Treatment Center.\n\nThe U.S. drug treatment system is an utter disaster and has been for decades. It is fragmented, bureaucratic, chronically underfunded and staffed by former drug users who have minimal education, training or supervision. According to a recent study by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Use at Columbia University, \"Most of those who are currently providing addiction treatment are not medical professionals and are not equipped with the knowledge, skills, or credentials to provide the full range of evidence-based services to address addiction effectively.\"\n\nTo put it bluntly, they don't know what they're doing. These ex-drug users have strong biases against methadone and buprenorphine, despite hundreds of studies over decades showing they are the most successful treatment for opiate addiction. They consider the use of these medications as \"enabling\" or \"cheating\" and use their power over drug users in their care to convince them not to take them. Researchers for the Columbia study found that, \"One of the key predictors of the underutilization of pharmaceutical treatments is adherence of treatment providers to a strong 12-step ideology for addiction treatment.\"\n\nMcCullough and Monteith were victims of the dysfunctional, outdated American drug treatment system. The pervasive stigma of taking maintenance medication and the failure of treatment programs to offer it without significant barriers bears much responsibility for both men's deaths.\n\nThe chain of events that led to McCullough's overdose started when the Baltimore Police Department posted a photograph online of a man committing robberies at two pharmacies; it was McCullough. He had stolen bottles of morphine and oxycodone pills. Warrants went out for his arrest.\n\nOver the years, David Simon had maintained a friendship with McCullough and consistently helped him when he relapsed. According to one of Simon's blog entries, DeAndre's mother, Fran, convinced her son to turn himself in but: \"DeAndre pleaded for the chance to get clean first, to sober up before surrendering and going to City Jail. He did not want to detox in pretrial detention; he couldn't stomach the thought of being sick in those spartan, unforgiving surroundings. Once sober, he would surrender....\"\n\nFor a few weeks, McCullough was at Turek House, another abstinence-based, 12-step program, but left before completing treatment. A few days later he was found dead.\n\nMcCullough rightly feared a brutal, cold-turkey detox in jail while awaiting arraignment. That should never happen, but because of harsh attitudes toward the drug-addicted and a sick desire to punish, it does every day. Methadone or buprenorphine (also known by the brand names Suboxone or Subutex) should be readily available to the incarcerated just like other essential medications are.\n\nIf DeAndre McCullough had been prescribed buprenorphine or had immediately been given access to methadone, he might not have reached the depths of despair, which led him to risk it all and rob two pharmacies for opiates so he wouldn't go into withdrawal. What kind of a society denies addicted and vulnerable people life-saving medication and puts them in no-win situations where they have to commit crimes just to feel normal?"

      "text": "Legal scholar: There will never be enough consequences for what Trump has done to the country\n\nIn the United States, there is one set of rules for rich people (especially if they are also white) and another set for everyone else. That unjust and anti-democratic system is reflected across American society. The country's wealth and income inequality is so extreme (especially the race-wealth gap) that it more closely resembles that of a Third World autocracy than one of the world's richest countries and a \"leading democracy.\"\n\nThere is the \"legal\" theft. The county's laws are literally written by the rich and the powerful. In turn, those laws represent their interests and goals over and above those of the average American. Political scientists have actually shown that America's elected officials on the national level are largely not responsive to the demands and needs of ordinary people.\n\nThe tax code is one such example of how the rich and powerful have created a system that rewards their class with subsidies, tax breaks, write-offs and other benefits to such a grotesque extreme that some of the country's richest individuals, families, and corporations pay no taxes at all - and in many cases actually receive \"refunds\" from the American people. \"Job creators\" and \"too big to fail\" are convenient shorthand to describe rent-seeking behavior and the ways many of the country's plutocrats and other members of the elite classes are economic and social parasites.\n\nEven allowing for the fact that the nation's laws are written to serve the interests of the rich and powerful, new reporting has shown that the top 1 percent of income earners still hide or otherwise do not report at least 20 percent of their income. That theft is on a massive scale: It is estimated to cost the American people $1.4 trillion over a 10-year period. The FBI also reports that so-called white collar crime costs the American economy hundreds of billions a year.\n\nThis should not be a surprise, but is still shocking: The IRS is much more likely to audit or otherwise investigate poor and working-class people than the rich.\n\nOf course, the rich and powerful have found a way to profit from the misery, death and destruction caused by the COVID pandemic. The Institute for Policy Studies estimates that the world's richest people have increased their wealth - measured in the trillions of dollars - by at least 50 percent during the coronavirus plague year.\n\nIn a pre-election article for the New Republic, Ankush Khardori explained how the Age of Trump and its many disasters created an ideal environment for white collar criminals:\n\nUltimately, the Trump regime and its allies provide an almost ideal example of how rich and powerful people can abuse and break the law, enrich themselves by doing it , and face few if any consequences for their anti-social behavior.\n\nJennifer Taub is a legal advocate, as well as professor of law at the Western New England University School of Law. Her most recent book is \" Big Dirty Money: The Shocking Injustice and Unseen Cost of White Collar Crime .\" Her previous book was \" Other People's Houses: How Decades of Bailouts, Captive Regulators, and Toxic Bankers Made Home Mortgages a Thrilling Business .\"\n\nIn this conversation, Taub explains how America's two-tiered legal system encourages financial and other crimes by the very rich. She also explores how members of that group learn that behavior throughout their lives and then normalize it. In addition, Taub profiles two cases, the opioid epidemic and the 2008 mortgage crisis and financial crash, that typify the widespread harm caused by white collar crime.\n\nTaub also reflects on a basic but powerful counterfactual: if Donald Trump had been properly punished by the law and imprisoned for the many financial and other crimes he committed earlier in life, the horror and pain caused by his presidency would likely have been avoided.\n\nThere are these hope-peddlers and others in the news media and elsewhere who keep suggesting that Donald Trump may go to jail or suffer some other severe punishments for his obvious crimes. When I hear such fables, I respond with a laugh. At worst, Trump will pay a fine. Members of his cabal who may face charges will likely do the same thing and plead out. There may be civil settlements. But none of the high-level Trumpists are going to prison. Rich people do not throw other rich people in jail. The powerful rarely if ever hold each other accountable.\n\nWill Donald Trump ever go to prison? Wearing my lawyer hat, I am supposed to speak in a slow, sober tone and say that before there is even a discussion about whether Donald Trump spends any time in prison there has to be a process and a trial, and then after that, if the prosecution proves the case, then, yes, that day will come. My more honest and yet cynical answer is that there will not be enough consequences for Trump, given what he has done over his lifetime to this country, his ongoing harmful and dangerous behavior. Even if they \"lock him up.\"\n\nThis is not the movie The Wizard of Oz where someone is going to pour water on Donald Trump and he is just going to melt. Ivanka and Jared and the other people in Trump's orbit and inner circle are not going to melt into a big pool of water on the floor either - and suddenly there will no longer be an oligarchy in America, or suddenly the billionaires will disappear who own most of the wealth in this country. That is not going to happen. We need to move forward. Bringing Trump to justice is not enough.\n\nWhat is Donald Trump an example of?\n\nDonald Trump is a perfect example of what is extruded from this unfair and sometimes corrupt system in America. Trump is somebody who is white, wealthy and well-connected and who used questionable behavior and sometimes criminal tactics to gain and sustain wealth and power.\n\nWhat makes Trump unusual, in my opinion, is how high in society he climbed. Trump has been involved in potentially illegal activity for decades and was able to get away with making civil settlements.\n\nHad Trump been held accountable before he ran for office back in 2015, he would have spent time in a federal prison instead of in the Oval Office. Trump is an example of the danger that we face as a society when we let people get by, because it's easier just to settle than to prosecute. For many of the civil settlements involving Trump and his businesses there could have been criminal punishments. It is just easier for the government to bring civil cases and settle with people sometimes than to charge them criminally. That is the same thing that happened after the financial meltdown of 2008, where we have examples of senior bank executives who settled their cases with regulators and then avoided criminal charges.\n\nAs a class of people, how are the rich different from everyone else? How does their world work?\n\nConsider a rich white kid. It is a cradle-to-grave system. People from the white suburbs go to rehab, they don't go to jail. The cops tell you, \"Turn down the music and go home.\" They don't escort you to the police station. That system of protections for the wealthy continues throughout their lives.\n\nWhat does that cradle-to-grave system look like?\n\nLeona Helmsley once said that \"taxes are for the little people.\" Spin that out more to \"Laws are for the little people.\" The problem with Helmsley is she said the quiet part out loud and was too mean and too greedy and so she went to a Club Fed prison for 18 months. She was the exception, not the rule.\n\nThere's a saying accountants tell their well-to-do clients: Pigs get fat; hogs get slaughtered. Yet for every example set, there is plenty of space for the rich and white, especially rich white men, to make mistakes and be forgiven time and again. That is also a space to be predatory and have one's behavior covered up and otherwise ignored. And it's not just about getting away with crime, it's also about getting by without all that much effort or merit.\n\nIt's the ability to be of average ambition or average motivation or average performance and still be assured a safe place to live. To still be assured a decent standard of living and the respect of society and the ability to go about your life even as an adult making mistakes. They know they won't end up living on the street because of their mistakes. It is astonishing to see how different the world of the rich is from how everyone else lives.\n\nHow does America's two-tiered legal system work in practice?\n\nWe have a double standard in the American criminal justice system that reflects and perpetuates inequality. Cutting legal corners is a tool for advancement only available to the already affluent.\n\nThe wealthy not only increase their power by evading punishment, but also benefit from a criminal justice system that incarcerates those with lower social status who also attempt to use crime to get ahead. Scale that up to a multinational corporate enterprise dodging the law, and the disparities are even more stark. Corporations guilty of felonies enter into deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements with the government and reoffend again and again. Yet high-level executives are rarely prosecuted.\n\nEven when the exception proves the rule, and a high-status individual is prosecuted and convicted, the double standard carries into sentencing, where statutory guidelines require judges to give serious weight to a convicted felon's past contributions to their community. Such leniency fails to acknowledge that preemptively spreading around ill-gotten funds to charities is a con artist's trick to gain public trust, manipulate community do-gooders and inoculate themselves. Forgiveness is often reserved for the fortunate.\n\nThe federal prison system allows wealthy offenders better conditions than ordinary convicts, with low-security camp settings for the former and dangerous caged conditions for the latter. Often, when top-shelf felons - like 1980s junk bond king Michael Milken, 1990s lifestyle guru Martha Stewart and recently released Enron CEO Jeff Skilling - complete a prison sentence, they rejoin high society with sufficient funds to rehabilitate themselves and relaunch their careers with little lasting stigma.\n\nIn 2019, the actress Lori Loughlin, indicted in the college admissions scandal known as Operation Varsity Blues, reportedly sought to hire a crisis management firm that might fashion her redemption in Martha Stewart style. In contrast, the impact of incarceration on the poor and working class can be irreversible for both the defendant and their children for years, if not generations, to come.\n\nWhat does justice look like in America for the rich and the poor, the elites versus everyone else?\n\nWe are all entrenched in a legal system that helps the most powerful protect their private property and contract rights. And that same system subordinates those with less resources and power.\n\nThe same system and same courts set up to oversee those types of private disputes also handle criminal matters with a similar mindset. Criminal laws as written, interpreted and enforced tend to punish far more severely those who take property from the wealthy, and let off the hook the giant enterprises and wealthy individuals who take things of value, including lives, from the middle class and poor.\n\nTo me, equal justice would mean that prosecutors would have a \"collateral consequences\" standard applied to ordinary people, not just business organizations, before they prosecute. We would have treatment available and not prison for drug offenders. We would also eliminate cash bail and only impose pre-trial detention on those who are a flight risk or a danger to their community or themselves.\n\nIn your book, you detail how the opioid crisis is an example of criminality and lack of accountability in America for the very rich. Can you share some of those details?\n\nPurdue Pharma shows the failures on the part of the Department of Justice in terms of enforcement and repeat offending. This is a company that was prosecuted previously. In 2007, the company did plead guilty to a felony for misbranding OxyContin under the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. Three senior executives - none of them Sackler family members -pleaded guilty to misdemeanors. But the company continued on.\n\nA decade after the 2007 guilty plea, the civil lawsuits brought by the states and private individuals begin. At the end of the Trump regime in 2020, Purdue Pharma pleaded guilty again as part of a DOJ settlement with the company. This time, in addition to pleading guilty to conspiracy to violate the the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act and to defraud the United States, Purdue also pled to violating federal anti-kickback laws.There were also civil charges against the Sackler family.\n\nBut where are the criminal charges against them or other real people? This is an example of how the failure to hold individuals accountable for the crimes of the organizations they are running or participating in does not create any kind of deterrence. It is not real accountability. It completely undermines the public trust. The Sackler family made billions of dollars. They are one of the wealthiest families in America. They amassed a reported $14 billion fortune and joined the ranks of America's 20 wealthiest families. Meanwhile, more than 232,000 fellow Americans died from prescription opioid overdoses between 1999 and 2018. All these poor and working-class people died from overdoses. The message is that some lives and families matter, and others do not.\n\nThe 2008 financial collapse is another example of how the rich are not held accountable for their crimes.\n\nThe nonpartisan reports on the financial crisis show that at every link of the toxic mortgage supply chain there was actual criminality. There are many who say things like, \"Well, it was perfectly legal!\" That is not true. There were loan originators who were encouraging people to lie on their forms. They were using whiteout to change people's income. There was fraud throughout the process from top to bottom. Decades of deregulation helped to fuel this.\n\nAs a society we do not have to live this way. We can create a kind of shared prosperity. We can create a system where we don't have financial bubbles, or if we do have bubbles and market downturns, the people with the least do not have to suffer the most. Likewise, the people with the most do not have to gain more wealth. This is happening right now with the so-called K-shaped \"recovery.\" I am grateful that the Biden administration seems to understand this problem and has responded with the COVID relief stimulus and hopefully the infrastructure bill gets passed as well.\n\nThere was a recent announcement that the very rich, the top 1 percent, hide 20 percent of their income or find ways not to report it. By some estimates that may be $1 trillion dollars or more over a 10-year period that is not collected in taxes. What are the practical implications of that thievery for the average American?\n\nFor example, when people are not paying what is legally required of them it means that someone else is not getting help recovering from their drug addictions, so instead they turn to crime. It means that the roads and bridges are not safe. It means that kids do not have access to preschool. Because the rich are not paying the taxes they owe and otherwise hiding income, it means that they are a de facto criminal class. The 1 percent are literally becoming wealthier and more powerful from criminal behavior. They use their influence to change the laws so that they pay fewer taxes, and this includes underfunding the IRS.\n\nWhat are the tax investigators and others looking for with Trump and his inner circle? What does \"criminality\" in that context look like?\n\nIn Trump's case, apparently both the Manhattan DA and the New York state Attorney General are looking at tax fraud under state law. More generally, the reason why tax fraud can be so prevalent is that there is a voluntary system of compliance for the most wealthy.\n\nOrdinary people who work for a living have taxes withheld by their employers, paycheck by paycheck. The very wealthy, however, earn money in all sorts of ways that they are supposed to self-report including investment income and consulting arrangements and sales of assets like artwork or jewelry for cash. While in some cases investment firms will report to the IRS on behalf of customers, banks do not need to report incoming and outgoing payments, so there is a great deal of unreported income. So, then it's up to the wealthy to tell the IRS truthfully and to assess losses that they can subtract from their income truthfully."

      "text": "This Is How White Male Privilege Is Destroying America\n\nIn a sociology textbook yet to be written there will be a chapter on white male privilege. The spectacle of Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination will be one of that textbook's primary case studies.\n\nThere are numerous credible allegations against Kavanaugh, and multiple witnesses who confirm that Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee and his friends participated in a culture of sexual violence, debauchery, drunkenness and violence while they were students at Georgetown Preparatory School and then at Yale University.\n\nDuring his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Kavanaugh repeatedly lied about a range of topics including his drinking, personal relationships and other behavior. It has also been reported by NBC that Kavanaugh also lied about his knowledge of the sexual assault allegations made against him by Deborah Ramirez .\n\nKavanaugh also claimed that he was admitted into Yale University by \"busting his tail\" and that he had no \"special connections.\" This is nowhere near true. Kavanaugh was a legacy admission; his grandfather attended Yale.\n\nMoreover, during his Senate testimony Kavanaugh displayed moments of fitful rage and anger. Under the influence of alcohol and fueled by male bravado, confidence, entitlement and peer pressure a younger Brett Kavanaugh was quite likely a terror.\n\nBy comparison, Christine Blasey Ford was remarkably credible. She was calm and poised, even while being, quite literally, publicly interrogated by a sex crimes prosecutor hired by Republicans.\n\nAs Dr. Stacey Patton summarized on Twitter:\n\nWhite male privilege is being able to cry during a job interview, interrupt the folks asking questions, yell at them, ask snarky questions, refuse to give straight answers, talk about how much you like to drink beer, and have other white men on the committee empathize with you.\n\nEven Paul Krugman, more a mainstream liberal than a radical \"social justice warrior,\" can see the levers of white male privilege coupled with money and power at work in the Kavanaugh debacle. On Monday, he wrote in the New York Times:\n\nWhen Matt Damon did his Brett Kavanaugh imitation on \"Saturday Night Live,\" you could tell that he nailed it before he said a word. It was all about the face - that sneering, rage-filled scowl. Kavanaugh didn't sound like a judge at his Senate hearing last week, let alone a potential Supreme Court justice; he didn't even manage to look like one.\n\nBut then again, Lindsey Graham, who went through the hearing with pretty much the same expression on his face, didn't look much like a senator, either.\n\nThere have been many studies of the forces driving Trump support, and in particular the rage that is so pervasive a feature of the MAGA movement. What Thursday's hearing drove home, however, was that white male rage isn't restricted to blue-collar guys in diners. It's also present among people who've done very well in life's lottery, whom you would normally consider very much part of the elite.\n\nIn all, Kavanaugh's nomination to the United States Supreme Court -- whatever may happen with his confirmation -- is one more reminder of how social capital, gender, race and class create a system of entitlement and privilege for rich white men like Kavanaugh (and Donald Trump) where they are never to be held accountable, either as adults or children, for their behavior. As sociologist Shamus Khan explains in the Washington Post , this is elite privilege filtered through America's rape culture.\n\nHow could a man who appears to value honor and the integrity of the legal system explain this apparent mendacity? How could a man brought up in some of our nation's most storied institutions - Georgetown Prep, Yale College, Yale Law School - dissemble with such ease? The answer lies in the privilege such institutions instill in their members, a privilege that suggests the rules that govern American society are for the common man, not the exceptional one.\n\nThe classical root of \"privilege,\" privus lex, means \"private law.\" The French aristocracy, for instance, was endowed with privileges, primarily exemption from taxation. Today's equivalents are not aristocrats, yet they have both the sense and the experience that the rules don't really apply to them and that they can act without much concern for the consequences. Elite schools like Georgetown Prep and Yale have long cultivated this sensibility in conscious and unconscious ways.\n\nOf course Kavanaugh's defenders and enablers are personally invested in denying such contradictions and hypocrisy. David French's defense of Kavanaugh last week in the National Review is a near-perfect example:\n\nLet's first begin with obvious points, points I've made time and time again. Emotion isn't evidence. But emotion has power. When you combine emotion with evidence, there is greater power still. And, make no mistake, when Brett Kavanaugh spoke with great emotion not just about the sexual-assault allegations against him but also the broader character attacks made against him by Democrats, he voiced the emotion of honorable conservatives across the nation. ...\n\nThis was the moment when a member of the \"establishment,\" the person who is supposed to sit quietly, respond mildly, and understand the pain of their opponents without voicing their own anguish, to absorb anger without showing anger, finally said \"enough.\" And he did so with great passion in his own defense, and no rancor against Christine Blasey Ford.\n\nIt was all the more powerful because it came from a person of known restraint. And his passion was magnified by another person known for his desire to reach across the aisle - the \"RINO\" most loathed by the populist Right - Lindsey Graham. This, incidentally, is why you default to restraint. This is why you don't live a life of rage but instead strive for proportionality - because when you do express your anger, people listen.\n\nFrench concluded:\n\nToday, there were conservatives across the nation who choked up - some openly wept - during his testimony. Not because they disrespect women. Not because they excuse sexual assault. But because they also love their sons. Because they are tired of being painted as evil when they are seeking to do what's right. Because they want to see a man fight with honor.\n\nThat's what Brett Kavanaugh did today. He fought with passion, evidence, and compassion. And absent any new, substantiated revelations, he united the conservative movement. Any Republican who abandons him now will abandon the electorate that put them in power.\n\nWhat French sees as a noble and valorous display of emotion by elite white male conservatives such as Brett Kavanaugh are behaviors not publicly tolerated or encouraged for black Americans or women.\n\nIn American's (white) popular imagination, black men and black women who act in such a way are deemed to be \"angry.\" Women who act in such a way are \"hysterical\" or \"bitches.\" These dehumanizing labels are used to legitimate violence against black people and women. Black women bear a double burden because historically and through to the present they have been stigmatized both because of their skin color and gender.\n\nThe freedom of Whiteness and white masculinity as spaces where emotions like rage and anger are both allowed and encouraged is exclusive. Like black people, Asians, Arabs, Muslims, Latinos, Native Americans and other nonwhites are not allowed such liberty. In that and other ways nonwhites are most certainly less free as citizens and human beings than are white men in America and other parts of the West.\n\nFrench's argument is part of a broader strategy by Republicans, conservatives and other Kavanaugh defenders. It has two dimensions.\n\nSuperficially, the goal is to present Kavanaugh as a man and a human being who just happens to be white, male and angry and has suffered a great disservice . If viewed through such a lens and framework, what reasonable and rational person would not be angry?\n\nThis is French's main ploy and distraction. What he and other right-wing defenders of Kavanaugh want to avoid is a discussion about angry white men as a group , one with a distinct and clear set of political priorities and goals.\n\nWhat do these angry white men want? It's an easy question to answer. They want to rule over and control all areas of American life, both private and public.\n\nBut here Kavanaugh's defenders fail in their insincere efforts to present him as the universal subject and a stand-in for all men (or women) unjustly accused of a crime. From Donald Trump to Fox News and the direct statements of white men such as Sen. Lindsey Graham and many others, Kavanaugh is the standard bearer for an obvious and clumsy type of white identity politics in which rich white conservative Christians are the \"real victims\" in America.\n\nIt is all delusional. Rich white men control every social, economic and political institution in the United States; the lies of white male victimhood remain compelling and intoxicating, as they have since before the founding.\n\nThis cult of white male victimhood would not be such a powerful cultural and social force if it was only rich white men and other elites who were invested in reproducing this fantasy. Angry white men are a fraternity that cuts across lines of class and income. They collectively imagine themselves to be under siege.\n\nOn Tuesday, Donald Trump told reporters: \"It is a very scary time for young men in America, where you can be guilty of something you may not be guilty of. ... This is a very, very -- this is a very difficult time. What's happening here has much more to do than even the appointment of a Supreme Court justice.\"\n\nWhen Trump says \"young men,\" no adjective or modifier is needed. It is clear to everyone, given his inclinations, history, words and deeds, that \"young men\" of course means \"white men\".\n\nThis reflects a larger sentiment in America at present. For too many white men -- poor, working-class and middle-class -- there is widespread anger at somehow being displaced by nonwhites and women who are \"cutting ahead in line\" because of \"affirmative action\" and other nonexistent \"entitlements.\"\n\nThese angry white men feel obsolete and marginalized in a changing America, frustrated by globalization and excluded by a more cosmopolitan country. But their anger is misdirected toward the groups they perceive to be receiving \"special treatment.\" Their collective anger would be better directed at men who look like them but who have created social inequality, injustice and immiseration in America and around the world.\n\nThese angry white men are apparently incapable of personal self-reflection and accountability, and also loath to acknowledge how for centuries in America they benefited from unearned advantages that insulated them from having to compete fairly with people below them in the social order. Privilege can often make such critical thinking impossible.\n\nWhite male rage is also a powerful cultural force in America because, while it may be sourced and rooted in entitled white masculinity, many white women are partners in it as well. They reproduce, legitimate, nurture and literally benefit from it. To cite an obvious example, Sarah Huckabee Sanders is Donald Trump's mouthpiece and apologist .\n\nA recent CBS News public opinion poll shows that 70 percent of Republican women support Kavanaugh , while a Morning Consult poll indicates that only 15 percent of Republican women oppose his confirmation.\n\nHistory is a shadow over the present.\n\nIn America, for at least 100 years white women instigated racial terrorism against black men and boys with false cries of rape. From the end of slavery through to the late 20th century thousands of black people died because of the way white women incited white male rage and violence. Ultimately, women's investment and participation in white male violence against nonwhites is not a form of false consciousness: It is a choice.\n\nThis imagined fraternity of angry white men fills the hearts of its members with rage and resentment. But only the bellies of the very rich, the Brett Kavanaughs and other men of his class, which are truly full. The other white men in this fraternity of white male rage live on the scraps and hand-me-downs.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge and highlight the power and cultural force of angry white men in America. But we also cannot overlook the kinds of laws that their leaders want to enact and the kind of nation they hope will result.\n\nHiding behind the rhetorical camouflage of \"originalism\" and \"textualism\" in their understanding of the U.S. Constitution and its role in American life, these elite white men present the law and their interpretation of it as somehow pure and apolitical. In reality, it is anything but.\n\nWriting at Current Affairs, Nathan Robinson explores how Brett Kavanaugh's record as a judge reveals his deficit of human empathy :\n\nSo the courts are \"political,\" have always been political, will always be political. But political is not a dirty word. Politics is the expression of our deepest values, that which we find important. What does Brett Kavanaugh find important? Mark Stern of Slate says Kavanaugh has spent \"his career protecting polluters, scammers, corporations, and gun sellers\" and his idea of liberty is perverse: \"Liberty for undocumented minors and Guantanamo detainees ? No. Liberty for predatory lenders , industrial polluters , telecom monopolies , religious employers , Abu Ghraib abusers , and assault-weapon enthusiasts ? Absolutely.\" I am not quite this cynical, and would not put \"religious employers\" alongside  \"Abu Ghraib abusers,\" though the telecom companies certainly belong there.\n\nBut I do believe Kavanaugh would be a horrific Supreme Court justice, and I believe that because I think that judges should make sure claims by torture victims get litigated, should make sure workers get to unionize, and should make sure detainees aren't imprisoned on an island without trial until eternity. These are the responsibilities not just of a judge, but of any moral human being who has the power to affect the situation. And so Kavanaugh's parenting skills and stimulating repartee are irrelevant. It is important to use your job to do good, and to make sure the justice system is functional and fair, and Kavanaugh has not done that. Instead, he has made biased, illogical, morally repugnant, non-textualist (gasp!) decisions that make the world worse. This should cause everyone to oppose his confirmation.\n\nAngry white men like Brett Kavanaugh want to further expand an American dystopia where women, nonwhites, Muslims, immigrants, gays and lesbians, the disabled, the poor and other people and groups deemed to be \"less than\" are treated as second-class citizens. This American dystopia sounds terrifying for many people, but it represents a paradise greatly to be desired for men like them.\n\n*  *  *\n\nThere is a long-standing argument among social scientists as well as other researchers that those who benefit from privilege are unaware of its existence. This state of affairs is normal for the privileged, so much so that angry white rich and powerful men like Brett Kavanaugh are wholly unaware that their life experiences are not universal. The book \"White-Washing Race: The Myth of a Color-blind Society\" summarizes this:\n\nAccording to a well-known philosophical maxim, the last thing a fish notices is the water. Things that are unproblematic seem natural and tend to go unnoticed. Fish take the water they swim in for granted, just as European Americans take their race as a given, as normal. White Americans may face difficulties in life -- problems having to do with money, religion, or family -- but race is not one of them. White Americans can be sanguine about racial matters because their race has not been (until recently) visible to the society in which they live. They cannot see how this society produces advantages for them because these benefits seem so natural that they are taken for granted, experienced as wholly legitimate. They literally do not see how race permeates America's institutions -- the very rules of the game -- and its distribution of opportunity and wealth.\n\nThis narrative is compelling. But it is clearly not true in the case of elite white men like Brett Kavanaugh and the other angry white men of this historical moment. They are hyper-aware of their privilege and power. This awareness may be latente until activated under threat or challenge. Nonetheless it is real, and those who possess white male privilege -- especially the luxury to be rich angry white men -- take it as a birthright. As America and the world are now witnessing with the Kavanaugh saga specifically and the age of Trump more generally, woe be unto anyone who challenges their sense of untouchable entitlement and permanent victimhood."

      "text": "Trump's MAGA America revives a Confederate nightmare\n\nWelcome to your first full day in the new Confederate States of America.\n\nMuch like the old CSA, the new CSA (also known as MAGA America) is devoted to: - Making American as white as possible, - Stripping women and minorities of political and economic power, - Gutting workers' rights, - Rigging election outcomes, - Leaders nakedly taking bribes, - Using a phony veneer of Christianity to justify brutal policies, - Making queer people invisible, - Reconfiguring schools for indoctrination, - Having militias terrorize minorities and their opponents, and, - Maintaining a government of, by, and for rich white men.\n\nNever in American history has a group of morbidly rich white men this large or with anything close to this net worth sat to watch a president get sworn into office, and never before have so many billionaires been in a president's cabinet.\n\nTrump has been openly selling legislation; for example, he recently told a group of fossil fuel CEOs that, if they'd give him a billion dollars, he'd gut the nation's environmental laws that they don't like.\n\nSeeing the opportunity, the nation's richest people have flocked to Trump's side, each presumably hoping for their own desired federal subsidies or an end to regulations, government lawsuits, or anti-trust actions.\n\nAnd, of course, they all want more tax cuts.\n\nThe Immigration Act of 1924 limited people coming into the country based on race; each year's immigrants must be selected in a way that maintained the racial ratios that existed in 1890 (before the big wave of swarthy southern European immigrants, most Italian and Greek, that came here during the three decades between 1890 and 1924).\n\nIn 1965, Congress passed a new immigration law that ended the racial/country quotas, leading to a rapid increase in Black and Brown immigrants entering the country legally. Combined with illegal immigration, Reagan's amnesty, and birthright citizenship for their children, the browning of American picked up speed to the point where 2014 was the first year when nonwhite children outnumbered white kids in the nation's public schools.\n\nTo end this trend and make America white again, Trump has, at various times, proposed that America no longer allow immigrants from majority Black \" shithole countries,\" banned immigration from majority-Muslim countries, will harden the southern border, and last night signed an executive order to end birthright citizenship.\n\nThe 14th Amendment defines birthright citizenship, saying:\n\nTrump's lawyers are arguing that people here without documentation are not \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of American law because they're not here legally. Therefore, they say, their children born here are also not \"born subject to the jurisdiction\" of American law and thus not citizens.\n\nThey plan to take their argument to the Supreme Court, where it may receive a favorable hearing. If successful, they might even have a case for stripping citizenship from and then deporting tens of millions of mostly Hispanic American citizens whose parents were undocumented.\n\nOur MAGA Supreme Court majority has already succeeded in several steps toward this goal, by ending abortion rights and gutting both civil rights and voting rights laws.\n\nFour GOP-controlled states are considering charging women who get abortions with murder , and Republicans on the Supreme Court have already functionally outlawed affirmative action and given states the power to make voting harder for Black, Hispanic, and Native American people.\n\nVice President Vance has written to the Justice Department demanding that they begin to enforce the moribund Comstock Act, which would outlaw the mailing of abortion and birth control medications, among other things (including porn).\n\nMeanwhile, DEI programs in both government and the corporate world are being ended to once again allow companies with white leadership to give preference to white men up for jobs or promotions. Looking at the composition of Trump's incoming administration and cabinet, it's reasonable to assume that nonwhite people must be willing to play the role Samuel L. Jackson did in Django Unchained if they want a position.\n\nIn his last administration, Trump put the virulently anti-union lawyer Eugene Scalia (son of former Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia) in charge of the Labor Department. His current nominee, former Congresswoman Lori Chavez-DeRemer , has a more mixed record, but she won't be setting the administration's labor policy: Trump will.\n\nThe same Trump who told Elon Musk on a live X event :\n\nMusk laughed and said, \"Yeah.\" Bezos is also virulently opposed to unionization of his Amazon workplace, and Trump has a long history of avoiding hiring companies with unions to do work on his properties.\n\nWhen the plantation oligarchs ended democracy in the Old South during the 1840-1860 era, they continued to allow elections. But white men who voted (they were the only ones allowed to vote) for anybody other than the oligarch's men often lost work, were beaten, and even sometimes lynched.\n\nRepublicans today are a bit more sophisticated, but their ability to rig elections has endured.\n\nIn the years immediately following the Republicans on the Supreme Court's Shelby County decision that eviscerated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, over 1600 polling places were closed by Republican-controlled states, most in Black neighborhoods. GOP-run state after state passed laws making it harder to register to vote, allowing challenges to voters and purges of voting rolls, and making it easier to refuse to count mail-in votes from cities with Democratic majorities by claiming signature mismatches.\n\nReporter Greg Palast estimates that if this had not happened and every eligible voter was allowed to vote and every vote cast was counted, Kamala Harris would today be president.\n\nRepublicans also work hard to select their voters, rather than allowing voters to select their representatives. While Democratic states have largely abandoned gerrymandering - which could have given Democrats a majority in the House today - Republican states have doubled down on the practice year after year.\n\nDonald Trump has rolled out a new meme cybercurrency that will allow any billionaire, company, or foreign country to shovel as much money as they want into his own personal pockets, presumably in exchange for whatever government contract, subsidy, or help they can negotiate with the new president.\n\nThe Confederacy, organized and run by a small handful of plantation oligarchs, was also notoriously corrupt, and state governments in the Old South often ran on a naked bribe system.\n\nSlaveholders in the Old South used Christianity to justify their inexecrable practice. Today's MAGA Confederates are no less hypocritical.\n\nJesus never once mentioned homosexuality or abortion, although he was explicit that preachers shouldn't pray in public and that the only way to join Him in heaven was to feed the hungry, heal the sick, welcome the stranger, house the homeless, and visit those in prison.\n\nNone of that matters, though, to the sanctimonious hustlers running megachurches and appearing on TV and radio; their only goal is to increase their own wealth and power. And Trump, who didn't even bother to put his hand on the Bible when he was sworn in, promises to gift them with money and prestige so long as they keep delivering their parishioners to the voting booths for Republicans.\n\nRepublicans across the nation have succeeded in banning thousands of books that feature or even contain queer characters or discuss homosexuality or transsexuality from schools and libraries. They're also launching legal efforts - with the explicit support of Clarence Thomas - to outlaw gay marriage and adoption, with the ultimate goal of sending queer people back into the closet as they were prior to the 1980s.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, promises to only recognize two sexes, essentially outlawing trans people.\n\nRepublicans are proposing in their platform to micromanage school curriculum nationwide by \"defunding schools that engage in inappropriate political indoctrination.\"\n\nThis appears to include removing references to our nation's history of slavery, patriarchy, and white supremacy; rewriting economic and social studies textbooks to make them more billionaire-friendly; and attacking socialism and communism in ways that may cause students to think that Social Security and similar programs are wrong.\n\nIn the Old South it was the Ku Klux Klan and the slave patrols.\n\nToday there are dozens of white supremacist groups and independent militias, all devoted to white supremacy and Christian nationalism. Trump's pardons of the criminals involved in January 6th tells us he's committed to having the militias that support him rebuild their ranks and get back out onto the streets, but this time on his behalf.\n\nAnd his continued opposition to gun control signals that, like dictators throughout history and most recently in Hungary and Russia, he wants them armed and dangerous.\n\nThe bottom line is that the oligarchy of the old Confederacy never really went away and arguably has just taken over the United States 164 years after they first fired on Fort Sumpter, this time with \" Tech Bros \" replacing plantation owners.\n\nThe big question now is whether they'll be able to hang onto the wealth and power they've managed to seize with this election. Oligarchy, after all, is usually a transitional form of government because people get so angry about the government doing everything for the rich and powerful and little to nothing for them that they demand change.\n\nPopular discontent rises until the oligarchs either slam down an iron fist to crush it with violence and thus flip the country into the type of tyranny you see today in Russia, or citizens overcome the oligarchy and restore democracy, as happened in Ukraine when Paul Manifort's guy (and Putin's friend) was deposed by the people in 2019, replacing him with Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nWhich way will it go in America? Unless Trump gets really violent really fast (a possibility), we'll probably know with the results of next year's midterm elections...\n\nNOW READ: Trump kept his promise - and made some Democrats look like fools"

      "text": "Trump's life is still in danger\n\nThe most important news about the attempted assassination of Donald Trump was not the plain fact of his attempted assassination but a picture of it. And like many pictures, no matter how \"iconic\" they are, it didn't last long in today's media environment. Once it ran its course, that was it. Five days later, even attempted assassination is old news.\n\nThis is bad for the Republican presidential nominee. I don't mean politically. I mean literally . Donald Trump's life remains in danger. He is America's greatest champion of rightwing political violence. What had been a flirtation before the J6 insurrection has since become a practical necessity. It was violence and the threat of violence that pushed many reluctant Republicans to accept The Big Lie as Truth. That \"purified\" the party of anyone who might stand in his way. And with that done, rightwing political violence had one more thing to do.\n\nThat is the story of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump as well as the biggest story of American politics. (Increasingly, Americans, especially Republicans, don't see the utility in democratic politics as much as they see the utility in political violence.) But that's not the story anyone is reading now. Instead, many reporters and pundits convinced themselves that Trump, as a consequence of nearly having been murdered, would stand before the country at the Republican National Convention as a figure of national unity.\n\nNot only is he temperamentally incapable of any such thing. His incentives do not lie in that direction. He's not trying to expand his base of support. His vote total maxed out at 47 percent four years ago. Therefore, Trump's best hope for a legitimate victory this year is by motivating non-voters to turn out or stay home. And the best way of doing that is by continuing to do what he's been doing, which is demonizing his enemies and repeatedly raising the specter of rightwing political violence if the election displeases him.\n\nIf Trump keeps going in this direction, and he will, because he can't help himself and because he has no options otherwise, he's going to endanger himself more. Why? The moment he pulls back, out of some need for political expediency, he will betray followers who have nothing but contempt for political expediency. Even all this talk of being a figure of national unity is risky. Rightwing politics doesn't want unity. Unity means compromise. It means impurity . What it wants is domination and control. And it will seek that end violently, even if or especially if its greatest champion seems to be standing in the way.\n\nI think the closed-circuit quality of all this could be at least disrupted, however, by a serious and sustained national conversation about the effect of political violence on democracy and democratic politics. Indeed, that's something you might expect to have happened in the aftermath of an attempted assassination of a former president. But that conversation isn't happening. The press and pundit corps have moved on. As a result, Donald Trump's life continues to be in danger.\n\nWhy have they moved on?\n\nIt may be due to the high-speed nature of today's media. But I think it has more to do with the media's character than its speed. We saw this in feeble attempts by some high-profile pundits to characterize the attempted assassination as if it were an assault on the body politic, and as with all assaults, there had to be sides, one being represented by Trump and the other being represented by Trump's counterparts.\n\nJust one problem.\n\nNot only was the shooter a Republican, but the 20-year-old white man from rural Pennsylvania also appears to have come from a family of right wingers who themselves seem greatly influenced by American militia culture. An insurrectionist interpretation of the Second Amendment was probably familiar to him, as likely was the belief that political violence is an acceptable alternative to democratic politics.\n\nIt's been said that if the shooter, whom I will not name, had been a Democrat or Black or trans or some other thing the Republicans could identify as an enemy, we would still be talking about the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. He wasn't, though, so we're not.\n\nBut if we leave it at that, I think we oversimplify the problem and overlook the consequences of ignoring the biggest story in American politics. The press corps is ignoring it, not so much because the shooter was a Republican, but because reporters risk appearing biased in leading a serious and sustained conversation about the effect of political violence on democratic politics that would, if done properly and in good faith, push the public toward an inevitable conclusion: that Donald Trump is partially to blame for his own attempted murder.\n\nIn the absence of that, lots of people seem to be feeling cognitive dissonance. However, it makes sense that a rightwing Republican would try killing Trump if you also understand that those who believe political violence is an acceptable alternative to democratic politics (as Trump does and the shooter did) often try to kill each other. The most serious consequence of avoiding this conversation, of course, should be the most obvious, that Trump continues to put himself in danger.\n\nIronically, it may be Trump himself who corrects this. Coming close to death by murder is a profoundly traumatic experience, especially for a rich white man like Donald Trump who has lived his 78 years of life imperious to violence. He evidently felt no threat after being told, on January 6, 2021, that many of the insurgents were armed. According to the J6 committee testimony, he said he wasn't the intended target. And according to Bloomberg, Mar-a-Lago has been lousy with security breaches. I'm guessing, however, that he never felt any fear. Why would Republicans, even violent ones, want to harm their champion?\n\nThat reality collapsed in an instance, and the resulting psychological scars might be big enough for the Washington press corps to notice."

(Photo by Owen Sweeney/Invision/AP, File)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Sometimes it's hard to tell who Hank Williams Jr. really is behind the dark sunglasses and the beard covering facial scars.\n\nHow much of him is a persona - or a stage presence - is further complicated by the fact that Williams takes on multiple identities, whether it's Bocephus or Thunderhead Hawkins, who is the centerpiece on his latest album. Sometimes he talks about himself in the third person as if he's reviewing a movie of his life.\n\n\"I'm a Gemini,\" said Williams, referencing the astrological sign that is represented by twins as a way of explaining who he is.\n\nWilliams has often defied easy characterizations. He is the son of an icon, the elder Hank Williams, whose tragic death left him at a young age with a legacy to both uphold and expand upon. After surviving a near fatal fall off a mountain in 1975, Williams took his own rowdy blue-collar Southern rock sound to new heights, changing the sound of country music.\n\nHis new record, \"Rich White Honky Blues,\" his first album since 2016, gives more insight into the Country Music Hall of Famer's early years and the influences that would eventually make him a singular artist.\n\nBlues has always been a part of his musical DNA. His father learned to play guitar in Alabama from a Black bluesman named Rufus \"Tee Tot\" Payne , but his parents were running a boarding house and had few resources.\n\n\"They don't have money to give him, but they did have food for the guitar lessons,\" said Williams of Payne.\n\nAfter his father's death at age 29, Williams Jr. was expected at an early age to follow in his footsteps. By the time he was 8, he was performing his late father's songs on stage, but on the car rides home, he was listening to blues by the likes of Bobby Blue Bland and late-night broadcasts of WLAC, a Nashville-based radio station that played rhythm and blues.\"I'm not listening to the Grand Ole Opry,\" said Williams. \"Never been a member of the Grand Ole Opry. Never will be. Period. And I've done pretty good.\"\n\nWilliams moved away from the traditional country that his father was known for and started merging genres - Delta blues, hard rock, country, soul - alongside bands like the Marshall Tucker Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd.\n\nHis No. 1 hits include \"A Country Boy Can Survive,\" \"Family Tradition\" and \"All My Rowdy Friends Are Comin' Over Tonight,\" which later became the opening theme song for \"Monday Night Football.\" He's been named entertainer of the year multiple times by the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country Music and won a Grammy for best country vocal collaboration.\n\nBut he also has become headline fodder for his boisterousness and brashness, especially in his later years. He's not quiet about his conservative political beliefs, likes singing about God, guns and the South. His comments once cost him the \"Monday Night Football\" intro spot.\n\nHis new record continues to mythologize the macho boogie-woogie man, even as he has reached his 70s. The album is a sexualized romp through X-rated blues material by Robert Johnson, Lightnin' Hopkins, R.L. Burnside and Muddy Waters, as well as Williams' own original tunes. Recorded at Dan Auerbach's Easy Eye Studio in Nashville, the session musicians include electric slide guitarist Kenny Brown, bassist Eric Deaton, drummer Kinney Kimbrough and Auerbach on guitar.\n\n\"We understood each other pretty quick,\" said Williams. \"I got over there with Kenny and them and Dan, and it was just like pouring water out of a cup. It went pretty smooth and we knocked it out in two and a half days.\"\n\nKen Levitan, Williams' longtime manager, said Auerbach, a Grammy-winning producer and one half of the rock duo The Black Keys, was just the right fit for Williams, drawn together because of their knowledge of the blues.\n\n\"There are matches that just work very, very well,\" Levitan said. \"And this one has worked extremely well.\"\n\nWilliams added his own off-the-cuff lyrical riffs to the songs, including sometimes crude remarks about women as the band snickers in the background.\n\n\"We say a few dirty words. Several dirty words,\" Williams said with a smile. \"This is Thunderhead Hawkins, south Alabama, Mississippi juke joint. And that's exactly how it sounds and how it feels.\"\n\nBut for all the bravado that Williams displays, he can't escape his own heartbreak as his family continues to endure tragedy.\n\nWilliams' eldest daughter Kate died in a car accident at age 27 in 2020, just months before it was announced he would be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Then his wife, Mary Jane Thomas, whom he married in 1990, died in March after a medical emergency at a Florida spa.\n\nThe last track on the album \"Jesus Won't You Come By Here,\" the only religious song on the record and penned by Lightnin' Hopkins, was a song Williams loved for decades. After all the debaucherous blues, he sings, \"Jesus, won't you come by here/Down on my knees to pray,\" like a sinner on Sunday.\n\nHe can't bring himself to sing the song live now following his wife's death.\n\n\"I loved that song 40 years ago. And still do love it,\" Williams said, his words catching. \"But I'm not going to be doing it live. Can't do it. I'm pretty damn tough. I can do a lot. I can't do that right now. Now you got the answer.\"\n\n\"Hank's had a very rough couple of years,\" Levitan said. \"At least in retrospect, (the song) has a huge significance at this point.\"\n\nWilliams doesn't like modern country record promotion, having little patience for interviews. He has an private jet waiting to take him back to his home a couple of hours outside of Nashville near Kentucky Lake and he made it clear he's done talking.\n\n\"For everything that's happened, I take a pretty positive attitude. But that song is wonderful,\" he said. \"The whole thing is getting a lot of attention. I guess that's why we're sitting here. It's getting a lot of attention, folks. I guess you would call me an attention-getting blues man. Bye.\"\n\nAnd Thunderhead Hawkins left the room.\n\n___\n\nOnline: https://hankjr.com/\n\n___\n\nFollow Kristin M.

(Library of America via AP)\n\nFILE - Richard Wright, author of \"Native Son,\" appears in New York on March 21, 1945. More than 60 years after his death, Wright's short novel, \"The Man Who Lived Underground,\" was released April 20, 2021, by the Library of America. (AP Photo/Robert Kradin, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - More than 60 years after his death, Richard Wright is again a bestselling author and very much in line with the present.\n\n\"The Man Who Lived Underground,\" a short novel written in the 1940s and never published in full until this spring, is the surreal but credible story of a Black man who is tortured by police into confessing to a double murder he didn't commit. He escapes into the city's sewer system. Like an inversion of the American road novel or a tale of space travel, Fred Daniels inhabits a world outside the world, making up the rules as he goes along and seeing his old life in a new way.\n\nAt one point, he breaks into a real estate office that collects money from poor Black people. Daniels finds a wad of money, and helps himself to a typewriter, radio and cleaver, among other items.\n\n\"He did not feel that he was stealing, for the cleaver, the radio, and the money were on the same level of value, all meant the same thing to him,\" Wright observes. \"They were the toys of the men who lived in the dead world of sunshine and rain he had left, the world that had condemned him.\"\n\nReleased by the Library of America, an unofficial canon of the country's literature, \"The Man Who Lived Underground\" also includes the Wright essay \"Memories of My Grandmother\" and an afterword from his grandson, the writer-filmmaker Malcolm Wright. The novel has reached the bestseller lists of The New York Times and the independent booksellers' Indiebound among others, and has brought new attention to an author defined, sometimes to his detriment, by his famed debut \"Native Son.\"\n\nCountless students have been assigned Wright's 1940 narrative about the poor young Black Chicagoan, Bigger Thomas, who in a state of panic murders a rich white girl, later murders his Black girlfriend and is tried and sentenced to death. The rare work by a Black writer to be featured by the Book of the Month Club, \"Native Son\" was among the most famous works of its time, and Bigger became a symbol of the damage done by a racist society.\n\nBut Wright's standing was challenged in the late '40s by James Baldwin, then an emerging writer, who criticized \"Native Son\" as simplistic \"protest\" fiction and wrote that Wright had failed to present Black life \"as a continuing and complex group reality.\"\n\nKiese Laymon, whose works include the acclaimed memoir \"Heavy,\" is among the current writers who admire \"The Man Who Lived Underground\" and believe it will change Wright's legacy.\n\n\"It gives us a lot from Wright that we haven't seen before,\" says Laymon, who, like Wright, is a Mississippi native. \"It's almost like a meta novel. Fred is experimenting, and you can see that Wright's desire is to discover and experiment.\"\n\nCharlie Braxton, a Mississippi-based poet and playwright, said his initial reaction to the book was anger at what happens to Daniels. But he was inspired by Wright's use of a \"psychological crime thriller\" to serve \"as a profound critique of racism/white supremacy and capitalism,\" and also touch upon organized religion and its role in \"the exploitation of Black people.\"\n\nWright worked on the book not long after \"Native Son\" came out, drawing on the true story of a Los Angeles man who lived for more than a year in the city's sewers; on memories of his Seventh Day Adventist grandmother; and on the \"Invisible Man\" films of the 1930s and '40s, a theme which predates by several years Ralph Ellison's classic novel \"Invisible Man.\"\n\nWright's publisher, Harper, turned \"The Man Who Lives Underground\" down, with one reader finding the author's depiction of police violence against Daniels \"unbearable.\" A shortened version of the novel, without Daniels' initial encounter with the police, was published in a 1944 story anthology and appeared in a collection of Wright's work that came out in 1961, a year after his death.\n\nThe revival of \"The Man Who Lived Underground\" began more than a decade ago, when the author's daughter and literary executor Julia Wright wanted to unearth some of his unpublished work. She was a prisoners' rights activist at the time, met with Mumia Abu-Jamal and other death row inmates, and followed closely the stories of police shootings of people of color, and the dismemberment of James Byrd by a gang of white supremacists.\n\nIn 2010, Julia Wright was seated in \"the comfortable, secluded, air-conditioned calm of the Beinecke Archives where my father's manuscripts are housed at Yale University.\" She told the AP that she \"came across a long version of the short story I knew so well but augmented by the 50 pages on police brutality. Bringing the whole work to light was not only timely, it was a cure against the physical dismemberment suffered by the James Byrds of our dark history.\"\n\nShe discussed a reissue with Library of America, which had already published two volumes of her father's work, and renewed her push last summer after the murder of George Floyd.\n\n\"We all understood that the publication was a priority,\" she said, adding that her father would have been pleased by the book's reception.\n\n\"He would have chuckled at this poetic justice. Sat and smoked his pipe for awhile without any complacency for America's immediate future. And, true to himself, he would have soon reached out for some paper to jot down a new 'white heat' idea.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Mark Tenally, File)\n\nOver the past 100 years, around 110 people have owned controlling portions of NFL teams. Of that select group, all but two have been white.\n\nThis basic head count might offer the simplest explanation for how, even with rules in place for nearly two decades that are designed to improve diversity, the league has struggled to build a pipeline for bringing Blacks and other minorities into coaching and front-office positions.\n\nThe lead investigator for the latest NFL Inclusion and Diversity Report gives a nod to the less-than-satisfying nature of the numbers in that report by leading off his opening message with the reminder: \"Progress is a process.\"\n\nIn 2021, the process produced these statistics: Black players make up about 70% of team rosters but the league has only three Black head coaches, while it had eight in 2011; Black coaches who fail in their first try in the jobs get inordinately fewer second and third chances than their white counterparts; the NFL this year recalibrated its much-celebrated Rooney Rule , which ensures minority candidates for front-office positions are identified and interviewed, to make sure teams talk to at least two such candidates for front-office positions and coordinator roles.\n\nAcademics who study the subject say the latest set of underwhelming numbers, along with the latest set of changes implemented in an attempt to improve them, are in line with the century-long history of a league that has been controlled by rich white men.\n\n\"To understand this problem, you have to look at it from a broader macro-historical lens,\" said John Singer, who teaches courses on diversity and social justice in sports at Texas A&M. \"It goes back to an old-boys network. It's an informal system in which wealthy men, particularly wealthy white men with social and economic backgrounds, help each other out.\"\n\nIn many ways, the academics say, the arc of diversity and inclusion in the NFL mirrors that in America itself. It's more complex than simply saying owners have long been more comfortable hiring people who looked and talked like them, though that certainly could be one element in play in a league that didn't hire a single Black head coach between Fritz Pollard in the 1920s and Art Shell in 1989.\n\n\"There's also a matter of who they think is most marketable, who resonates with their fan base,\" said Anthony Weems, an assistant professor at Florida International University who wrote a dissertation on NFL owners and the social structure they created over a century.\n\n\"Over time, a lot of these owners are the same people, or the teams got passed down in the family. So it's almost like, 'Why would things have changed if the actual players in those positions haven't changed?'\" Weems said.\n\nThe professors agree that it was no surprise earlier this year to see the racist emails that surfaced between Jon Gruden and former Washington executive Bruce Allen. Also not shocking, but far less spotlighted, was the scenario that played out in 2017 when Texans owner Bob McNair said \"We can't have the inmates running the prison.\"\n\nMcNair apologized and said he hadn't been speaking about the players. When he died in 2018, ownership of the team passed to his wife.\n\n\"There was backlash for sure, but why are they running Gruden out of a job when they allowed McNair to operate just fine and he passed the team down?\" Weems said. \"It's indicative of a larger culture.\"\n\nJaguars owner Shad Khan, one of the league's two minority owners, said he was taken aback when he tried to buy a controlling stake in the Rams in 2010.\n\n\"I had met some people at that time and the apology that went around, the conjecture was, 'You will never get approved because you're not white,'\" he said.\n\nBut he said those thoughts didn't match up with the reality. He moved on from the Rams and ended up buying the Jaguars in 2011, and paints a much more optimistic picture about NFL ownerships' relation to race.\n\n\"I think the league is at the forefront and they're going to be doing more,\" Khan said. \"And my being in the middle, yes, I've seen a change.\"\n\nIn a short essay that accompanied the latest diversity and inclusion report, lead investigator C. Keith Harrison writes about the academic topic of attribution bias, which, he explains, are errors made when trying to explain why people make decisions they make. It undercuts the idea that, for instance, all decisions made by a largely white group of owners might be based solely on race.\n\nStill, the results remain the same, and Harrison points to other academic studies that conclude the impact of biased behavior does add up over time.\n\n\"In the context of the NFL, African Americans and other human beings of color pay their dues, and when it appears to be their turn it is often a white coach hired again. And again. And again,\" he writes.\n\nHe used the example of Urban Meyer's attempt to hire Chris Doyle as an assistant for the Jaguars as a prime example.\n\nDoyle's hiring was squelched after accusations surfaced about his racist remarks and bullying of players during his 22 years at the University of Iowa.\n\nThat episode illustrated what many people see as one core problem in the NFL's diversity issue: A century's worth of white owners have built a system in which white coaches and leaders get far more second and third chances, while Black coaches are harder to find and don't have as many chances to fail. For instance, since 1963, 15 white coaches have been given a third head-coaching job, compared to zero coaches of color. (The report says Tom Flores was the lone coach to be afforded a third chance, but authors did not respond to The Associated Press when it asked what the third job was. Flores coached the Raiders and Seahawks.)\n\nCyrus Mehri, who co-founded the Fritz Pollard Alliance, which, according to its website, \"exists to champion diversity in the National Football League,\" said the league office is not to blame for the systemic diversity issues in the NFL.\n\n\"It's the owners,\" Mehri said, in a quote embedded in the diversity and inclusion report. \"We have spectacular candidates, and we still have decision making (among owners) that's irrational.\"\n\nJohn Solow, a professor who studied the NFL while teaching at Iowa and now is at Central Florida, who co-wrote a paper on the Rooney Rule in 2011, said that in the universe the owners have created, it can be argued that it's hard to tell if Black assistant coaches are being discriminated against because, compared to whites in the same positions, there haven't been enough of them over the years to do a truly scientific study on the issue.\n\nFor instance, between 2012-2021, whites were hired for 168 of the 219 (76%) open coordinator positions, which are considered the top launching pads for head-coaching jobs. That almost mirrors the hiring pattern for head coaches: Whites have been tabbed for 51 of the 62 openings (82%) since 2012.\n\n\"But then, you have to go back a step and say 'Why aren't there (more) Black assistant coaches?'\" Solow said. \"And then you ask 'Was there discrimination?' And we couldn't really find any. But we also couldn't really find any evidence that the Rooney Rule was working.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Mark Long contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)\n\nThe inseparable sisters always stood out - identical twins from Twinsburg, Ohio, whip-smart students from the side of town with unpaved streets and no sidewalks, excluded from the gifted track because they were Black.\n\nTheir friends were white and a classmate's comment still stings: \"'I don't even think of you as Black.' I said, ''Thank you.' And I felt pride,\" Brittani James recalls, shuddering.\n\n\"I believed we were special. I believed other people in our neighborhood weren't as good as us,'' she said.\n\nThe twins were indeed special - they won free rides to the Ivy League, earned medical degrees at prestigious universities, and have thrived in a profession where they are vastly outnumbered by virtue of their skin color.\n\nBut their mission now is to dismantle the entrenched bigotry behind that classmate's backhanded remark.\n\nAt 33, James and her twin, Brandi Jackson, have taken on the medical establishment in pioneering work to eliminate racism in medicine.\n\n\"We're teaching how to see it and how to undo it,\" Jackson said.\n\nJames, a family medicine doctor, and Jackson, a psychiatrist, have developed anti-racist coursework used in two Chicago medical schools. They've co-founded the Institute for Antiracism in Medicine, where physicians can earn continuing medical education credit for taking classes on how their profession has made Black patients sicker.\n\nThere's more. They're seeking federal legislation to require hospitals to reveal outcomes by race, with penalties for those where Black patients consistently fare worse. They've helped created an online support group to help like-minded, stressed-out Black doctors heal and strategize.\n\nThey've even hatched a plan to create black coats for doctors. That's not as radical as it might sound -- black coats were the tradition in the 19th century.\n\nTheir latest achievement? Helping lead a charge against the American Medical Association and the influential research journal it publishes.\n\nThe twins are riding a wave and they got there by ''learning to breathe underwater.'' That's how Jackson describes adapting to \"this constant oppressive pressure\" of racism.\n\n\"I remember being young and being told in school that I can't be smart, because of where I'm from, being told your hair is ugly,'' she said. \"You learn to live with the kind of pain that comes just for being. Just for walking down the street. You can't name it when you're that young. It does something to your psyche.''\n\nIt can break you, and Jackson and James have had fragile moments of self-doubt. But the pandemic year has fueled their resolve. They say the relentless toll on people of color from the coronavirus and video-documented police violence have laid bare the damage caused by structural racism.\n\n''It is literally killing us,'' James said.\n\n___\n\nIn recent steps that critics labeled mostly symbolic, the AMA has made an effort to come to grips with its racial history. The group excluded Black doctors from its ranks for over 100 years, and even today, just 5% of all U.S. physicians are Black.\n\nWithin the past few years, the nation's largest doctors' group hired Dr. Aletha Maybank as its first chief health equity officer and declared racism a public health threat. In February, it removed a statue displayed at its Chicago headquarters of Dr. Nathan Davis, AMA's founder, who promoted racist policies.\n\nBut later that month, a podcast hosted by the AMA's flagship medical journal caused a stir . The tweet promoting the podcast read, ''No physician is racist, so how can there be structural racism in health?''\n\nIt was, Maybank said, \"a gut punch.\"\n\nThe sisters' institute started a petition in response, demanding that the journal diversify its mostly white editorial staff and ensure that medical research relating to race and racism gets published. The effort has garnered more than 8,800 signatures so far.\n\nAMA suspended the journal's chief editor and a deputy editor resigned.\n\nAMA also agreed to meet last month to hear demands for change from several Black physicians, including James and New York cardiologist Dr. Raymond Givens, another leading AMA critic.\n\nThe doctors will be looking to hear how AMA plans to address their concerns at a second meeting, but James says the AMA's anti-racism plan - in the works long before the sisters' activism - makes her optimistic. In an 83-page document released Tuesday , AMA vowed to dismantle structural racism inside its own ranks and within the U.S. medical establishment with steps that include diversifying its own staff and collaborating with outside groups.\n\nThe group reached out to James and other physicians to discuss the plan - a hopeful sign, she said.\n\n\"We still have to hold their feet to the fire,\" she said.\n\nPart of the problem is doctors' deeply embedded identity as healers and \"good people,'' Jackson said. \"It's hard when you're indoctrinated in that culture to stop and say, 'Are we really doing good?'''\n\nA racial imbalance in medical leadership perpetuates the problem, James said -- those making decisions and policies don't look like the populations they serve.\n\nJames treats patients at a clinic on Chicago's South Side and teaches at the University of Illinois-Chicago. Jackson has taught at Rush Medical College and is the behavioral health director at a Chicago health network that treats LGBTQ and other underserved patients.\n\nWorking with students, medical residents and colleagues, they strive to highlight the harm caused by the disproven idea that there are biological differences in Black people that contribute to health disparities.\n\nSome examples:\n\n--The longstanding myth that Black people somehow have a higher tolerance for pain, perpetuated during slavery times, has often led to undertreatment.\n\n--Medical school instruction on skin diseases typically shows how they appear on white skin, not Black or brown, leading to missed diagnoses.\n\n--In psychiatry, impulsive, disruptive behavior in white children is often labeled attention deficit disorder, a diagnosis that often guarantees classroom accommodations. Identical behavior in Black kids is more often labeled conduct disorder, leading to detention rather than accommodations \"unless they have a really sharp parent who advocates the hell out of it,\" Jackson said.\n\n--A commonly used algorithm for kidney function gauges it differently in Black patients, potentially leading to undertreatment of kidney disease. Rush University Medical Center is among several U.S. health systems that recently stopped using that algorithm.\n\nThe sisters' message isn't new, said Dr. David Ansell, a physician at Rush who has worked with their institute. But their timing is uncanny -- coming at the convergence of a deadly pandemic that has highlighted racial health inequities, a rise in white supremacism, and civil unrest over police brutality.\n\nAt such a moment, he said, the sisters can make a difference.\n\n___\n\nTheir curiosity in science and medicine started young. James remembers taking ''field notes'' while spying on people. Jackson remembers turning their mother's blue bead case into a bug hospital.\n\n\"We emptied it and would go under rocks in search of potato bugs, worms. We gave each their own compartments ... then would examine them and took notes when they appeared sluggish.'' Once, they sprinkled salt on a snail to dry it out when it seemed \"too moist. He just curled up and died. I still feel bad about the snail,'' Jackson said.\n\nTheir parents were hard-working and supportive, but the twins didn't tell them when they were accepted at Cornell University, knowing the cost was prohibitive. They broke the news when they landed full scholarships.\n\nIt was during a college summer program that James for the first time saw a Black doctor. She stared. \"It was like a unicorn,'' but it planted a seed.\n\nThey separated for medical school -- Northwestern for Jackson, University of Michigan for James. Surrounded by rich white kids and professors, James struggled.\n\n\"It was this huge feeling like I don't belong here. None of the professors look like you, what you're learning about people like you is racist and you're getting tested on it.''\n\nShe left school for a year and sank into a deep depression until getting involved in volunteer community health work. Colleagues there encouraged her to go back. In low moments, James says she draws on the strength of ancestors.\n\n\"I'm not being bombed. I'm not being hosed,'' she said. ''You have to keep getting up.\"\n\nNow, she and her sister serve as mentors to other medical students from nontraditional backgrounds.\n\nMedical resident Shan Siddiqi is a Canadian Muslim whose parents are from Pakistan. He works under James' guidance at a clinic where James says \"the sickest of the sick'' go for treatment, patients with chronic illnesses worsened by poverty, stress from living in violent neighborhoods and now COVID-19. Siddiqi said he's impressed by her compassion, taking the time to treat them as humans and helping them overcome challenges to getting medication or specialty care.\n\nJordan Cisneros, a third-year medical student who Jackson has mentored at Rush Medical College, says her guidance has helped him get through a tough year. His father died from COVID-19 in January and George Floyd's televised death last May felt personal.\n\n\"I've had run-ins with police. I've had run-ins with racism. I've seen things firsthand,'' he said.\n\nIn a Zoom class last year, Jackson brought up Floyd's death and broke down crying. \"It's very taboo to cry in medicine,'' but Jackson made it seem OK to show emotion and vulnerability, he said.\n\n___\n\nThe sisters are extremely close, often finishing each other's sentences, but there are differences too.\n\nJames is married to a white physician, a guy she thought was a math nerd when they met but is now her partner in battle. She tears up when asked what she wishes for their 1 1⁄2-year-old daughter, Lillian.\n\n\"I don't want her to have to live in a box like I did,'' James said. \"I want her to raise her voice so she knows it's OK to be everything that she is, especially when the world is trying so hard to make Black and brown girls small and not heard.\"\n\nJackson is single, loves to cook in her spare time and thinks like a scientist in the kitchen, marveling at how a humble carrot can transform into something sublime with just a little butter and brown sugar.\n\nJames wears her passion on her sleeve and pours her soul into Twitter, calling out racism every time she sees it. Jackson says she has no appetite for Twitter wars and \"tries to be the one who is grounding. I want to come at it with a loving, calm energy,'' she said.\n\nThe sisters are hitting their stride in 2021; Jackson calls it the year of Black women: Michelle Obama helped pave the way, now there's Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"It moves me to tears that all of my ancestor Black women who never got to see the day ... that they were in vogue and their voice was listened to,'' she said. \"It is Black women's lives that survive and keep surviving.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at @LindseyTanner.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

      "text": "Teams say Indian names show respect, history says otherwise\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nColorful names for teams are nearly as old as team sports themselves.\n\nBut as a growing movement aims to right the wrongs of the past, including notable successes with pro sports franchises in Cleveland and Washington recently, it reminds us history hasn't always been kind - let alone fair - to marginalized groups.\n\n\"I don't know where the momentum is going to go,\" said Joshua Hunt, vice chair of The Committee of 500 Years of Dignity & Resistance, whose Cleveland-based organization joined a coalition of Native American activists who convinced the city's baseball team to drop \"Indians\" - first adopted in 1915 - from its name.\n\n\"But we're hoping,\" Hunt added, \"this will be a blueprint for professional teams like the (Atlanta) Braves, Kansas City Chiefs, (Chicago) Blackhawks and all the thousands of public schools that this is what happens when you take the time to actually listen to indigenous people.\"\n\nBy now, because of pressure from activists, the public or their corporate sponsors, most sports teams have shed overtly racist names of the past. More than a dozen major college or pro sports teams made the move over the last 50 years.\n\nBut a few have clung to Native American names and imagery, arguing they reflect honor and respect. History says otherwise.\n\nChariot-racing teams in ancient Rome first adopted colors and symbols - and later names - largely as a practical matter, to distinguish themselves from rivals during the actual events. Over time, though, those identifiers took on added significance. Like nations and religions, they became a marker to strengthen the bonds among followers and separate friends from foes.\n\nAs sports gained a foothold in America's popular culture in the late 1800s, fans needed a way to differentiate the many teams playing the same sports in the same city. Sometimes, it was as uncomplicated as adding the name of the neighborhood or point of pride for its residents, i.e. the Brooklyn Dodgers around 1910, because pedestrians there were constantly forced to detour around streetcar lines.\n\nOther times, the names were chosen to highlight the ethnicity of the players that made up the team, or to appeal to the language and culture of their fan base, like the Montreal Canadiens in 1909, because their francophone followers relished every chance to go up against English-speaking teams like the rival Wanderers.\n\nStill other times, names were derived from chants that originated with fans or suggested by reporters at local newspapers. The New York Highlanders baseball team officially changed its name after moving into the new Polo Grounds in 1913, but the city's dailies had been calling them the \"Yankees\" for nearly a decade by then, simply because it was an easier fit in headlines.\n\nBut as sports became increasingly popular and profitable at the turn of 20th Century, owners sought to fire up the imaginations of their fans. It hardly helped marginalized groups like Blacks and Native Americans that those owners tended to be rich white men, who found their beliefs in cultural superiority reflected in the accomplishments being notched around the world by America's growing might.\n\nMany of those owners named their teams Indians, Braves and Redskins at the very moment the United States government was in the final throes of a largely one-sided battle to take lands from various Indian and First Nations tribes and isolate its people on reservations - attempting to effectively destroy their language and culture.\n\n\"It was a learning process for me,\" Cleveland team owner Charles Dolan said in an interview with The Associated Press, \"and I think when fair-minded, open-minded people really look at it, think about it and maybe even spend some time studying it, I like to think they would come to the same conclusion: It's a name that had its time, but this is not the time now, and certainly going forward, the name is no longer acceptable in our world.\"\n\nBut activists argue that there was never an appropriate time, and certainly not when they began to show up. At the specialized boarding schools where Native Americans were sent for \"reeducation,\" the unofficial motto was \"Kill the Indian and save the man.\" A number of studies since have established the psychological damage those policies and the continuing negative portrayals in popular culture have inflicted on Native Americans, among whom suicide is a leading cause of death.\n\n\"Shortly after the so-called 'Indian Wars' of the 1880s, that's when we see sports teams start to use the names on a wide basis,\" said Hunt. \"It's almost as if they did it to say, 'After we defeated them, now we're going to parade them around.'\n\n\"It's sort of like a when a hunter kills a bear or a deer and puts their heads on a wall. 'Look, we killed and conquered these people.' And,\" he said, \"at the same time these mascots start showing up, the federal government has made it illegal for indigenous people to speak their own languages or honor their own customs.\"\n\nAn organized pushback against offensive names and imagery didn't begin in earnest until the 1960s, as groups like the American Indian Movement became part of a broader push for civil rights across the country. Coincidentally, the federal government's relocation program had by then moved enough Native Americans into large cities, where many became fans of local sports teams and began to mount efforts to change those names.\n\nMany of those activists credit the 1972 decision by Stanford University, a prestigious school with sports programs to match, to drop \"Indians\" from its name as an important first step. In 2005, the NCAA finally adopted a policy banning \"hostile and abusive\" names and mascots, excepting schools that had reached an agreement with particular tribes to use their name, such as the Florida State Seminoles.\n\n\"The hopeful thing is we see that when a respected institution merely announces it's going to change, like we saw in Cleveland, that often leads to a flood of nonprofessional teams changing,\" Hunt said.\n\n\"There's no silver bullet. It can't just be a top-down or bottom-up focus. ... I think we've still got something like 400 teams with those names here in Ohio. We need local grassroots campaigns and high-profile groups and we need to advocate for change and support one another.\"\n\n\"But,\" he said, \"what just happened here in Cleveland is already putting another shot in the arm.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - A rare bipartisan deal in Congress to overhaul federal sentencing laws passed after a few black ministers, leaders and lawmakers forged an alliance with President Donald Trump, who some have condemned as racist for the last two years.\n\nThe reforms could offer a path to freedom for hundreds of black and Latino inmates who were sent to prison by a justice system that critics say has long been stacked against minorities.\n\n\"It's like threading a needle politically,\" said Marc Morial, the National Urban League's president and CEO. \"It's been very delicate to get us to the point where we are right now.\"\n\nBishop Harry Jackson, pastor of Hope Christian Church in Beltsville, Maryland, still gets questions from fellow African-Americans asking him why he and other conservative black ministers went to the White House over the summer to talk about the issue with Trump.\n\n\"People are still mad at us about that,\" Jackson said.\n\nBut the end result could be worth it to address what Jackson called \"the defining civil rights issue of this era,\" even as detractors complain that the legislation did not go far enough and could invite new problems for minority communities.\n\nThe bill, which is expected to go to Trump soon for his signature, gives judges more discretion when sentencing some drug offenders and expands prisoner rehabilitation efforts. It also reduces the life sentence for some drug offenders with three convictions, or \"three strikes,\" to 25 years.\n\nAnother provision would allow about 2,600 federal prisoners sentenced for crack cocaine offenses before August 2010 the opportunity to petition for a reduced penalty.\n\nThat will be a win for minorities who were caught up in a sentencing system that made crack cocaine a more serious offense than other types of cocaine, said New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2020.\n\n\"When you correct an injustice in a biased system, it dramatically helps the marginalized people,\" Booker said. \"That provision alone, 96 percent of the people who are helped by that, are black or Latino.\"\n\nAmong the advocates of the legislation was a diverse and unlikely group that included presidential adviser Jared Kushner, Kim Kardashian West, the National Urban League, black ministers and minority lawmakers and libertarian-leaning conservatives.\n\nSome of the bill's advocates say it was a tough decision to work with a White House that is deeply unpopular with black people. More than 8 in 10 African-Americans said they thought Trump was racist in a February poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\n\nBut even the supporters say they know this legislation is only the beginning, as reflected by its name, the First Step Act.\n\nGroups such as the NAACP cheered the passage of the bill but also harbored reservations.\n\nThe legislation \"offers some important improvements to the current federal criminal justice system, but it falls short of providing the meaningful change that is required to make the system genuinely fair,\" said Hilary O. Shelton, director of the NAACP's Washington bureau.\n\nThe bill only affects the federal system, meaning anyone given harsh sentences at the state and local level will have no recourse. Those inmates make up the bulk of people behind bars across America.\n\nBlacks constitute 38 percent - or about 68,000 - of the more than 180,000 inmates in the federal prison population, according to the Bureau of Prisons. Hispanics make up 32 percent - or about 58,000 - of federal prison inmates, with about 122,000 non-Hispanics in federal prison.\n\nSome groups say the bill will open the door to increased surveillance of minority communities through electronic monitoring of released inmates. Others point out limitations in the bill on which federal prisoners will benefit from its changes.\n\nThe Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of more than 150 black-led organizations, called the legislation \"custom-made for rich white men.\"\n\n\"All of the carve-outs make the vast majority of our people ineligible for the benefits of the bill,\" the group said.\n\nEven with the limits, the bill's advocates are thrilled to have made progress on an issue where reform has remained elusive for more than a decade. Jackson said any president willing to talk about even minor changes should be worked with.\n\n\"I believe with all my heart, if Dr. Martin Luther King was alive, he would have been in that meeting,\" Jackson said. \"And he would have been advocating for the voiceless instead of playing politics and personality games.\"\n\n___\n\nJesse J.

      "text": "College Sports Are Affirmative Action for Rich White Students\n\nAthletes are often held to a lower standard by admissions officers, and in the Ivy League, 65 percent of players are white.\n\nQuick, think of a college athlete. Chances are the person who comes to mind is a football or basketball player at a powerhouse Division I school like Louisiana State University or the University of Kentucky. Maybe the player resembles, say, Joel Embiid, who turned a chiseled, 7-foot frame into a full-ride scholarship at the University of Kansas before ascending to NBA stardom.\n\nBut the typical student athlete more often plays a less blockbuster sport-lacrosse, maybe, or tennis-and in many cases comes from a well-to-do family that has shelled out thousands and thousands of dollars over the years to nurture a budding athletic talent. And a majority of the time, they're white.\n\nThe most visible college athletes-the ones running across bar-TV screens or in full-color photographs on newspaper sports pages-tend to be black. Indeed, college football and basketball players skew disproportionately African American. But, says Kirsten Hextrum, a professor of educational leadership at the University of Oklahoma, \"the black men in these two sports are not the reality of who has access to college sports.\"\n\nBy the National Collegiate Athletic Association's own estimate , 61 percent of student athletes last year were white. At elite colleges, that number is even higher: 65 percent in the Ivy League, not including international students, and 79 percent in the Division III New England Small College Athletic Conference, which includes elite liberal-arts colleges like Williams College and Amherst College. As Harvard heads to court to fend off allegations that it discriminates against Asian American applicants , the plaintiffs behind the case have released to the public reams and reams of data analyzing the school's admissions process. They allege that one factor used in admissions, called \"personal rating,\" systematically disadvantages Asian American students. But tucked into the 168-page analysis of Harvard's admissions data is a curious statistic about another nonacademic factor considered by the school: athletics.\n\nAll applicants to Harvard are ranked on a scale of one to six based on their academic qualifications, and athletes who scored a four were accepted at a rate of about 70 percent. Yet the admit rate for nonathletes with the same score was 0.076 percent-nearly 1,000 times lower. Similarly, 83 percent of athletes with a top academic score got an acceptance letter, compared with 16 percent of nonathletes. Legacy admissions policies get a lot of flak for privileging white applicants, but athletes have a much bigger effect on admissions, and make up a much bigger percentage of the class. And it's not just Harvard-in 2002, James Schulman and former Princeton University President William Bowen looked at 30 selective colleges and found that athletes were given a 48 percent boost in admissions, compared with 25 percent for legacies and 18 percent for racial minorities.\n\nRead: What the Harvard trial is really about\n\nPut another way, college sports at elite schools are a quiet sort of affirmative action for affluent white kids, and play a big role in keeping these institutions so stubbornly white and affluent. What makes this all the more perplexing, says John Thelin, a historian of higher education at the University of Kentucky, is that \"no other nation has the equivalent of American college sports.\" It's a particular quirk of the American higher-education system that ultimately has major ramifications for who gets in-and who doesn't-to selective colleges.\n\nWhen it comes to college athletics, football and basketball command the most public attention, but in the background is a phalanx of lower-profile sports favored by white kids, which often cost a small fortune for a student participating at a top level. Ivy League sports like sailing, golf, water polo, fencing, and lacrosse aren't typically staples of urban high schools with big nonwhite populations; they have entrenched reputations as suburban, country-club sports. According to the NCAA, of the 232 Division I sailors last year, none were black. Eighty-five percent of college lacrosse players were white, as well as 90 percent of ice-hockey players.\n\nAnd the cost of playing these sports can be sky high. \"There are high economic barriers to entering in this highly specialized sports system,\" Hextrum says. \"White people are concentrated in areas that are resource rich and have greater access to those economic resources.\" Getting good enough at a sport to have a shot at playing collegiately often necessitates coaching, summer camps, traveling for tournaments, and a mountain of equipment. One in five families of an elite high-school athlete spend $1,000 a month on sports-the average family of a lacrosse player spends nearly $8,000 a year. Kids from low-income families participate in youth sports at almost half the rate of affluent families, according to a report from the Aspen Institute. It's no surprise, then, that per The Harvard Crimson 's annual freshman survey, 46.3 percent of recruited athletes in the class of 2022 hail from families with household incomes of $250,000 or higher, compared with one-third of the class as a whole.\n\nBut there are other, more veiled factors that may also boost the numbers of white college athletes. For one, many elite colleges-including Ivy League schools and smaller Division III colleges-don't offer athletic scholarships, so they can't give low-income sports stars a free ride like big, Division I schools can. Michele Hernandez Bayliss, a private college counselor and a former assistant admissions dean at Dartmouth College, walked me through the process: Over the summer, coaches compile lists of the athletes they want, which they then share with the admissions office. \"Most of the recruiting happens in the early rounds. Once coaches have their list, they would rather wrap up the whole process early rather than wait until the spring,\" Hernandez said. That the recruited athletes are chosen early on is seemingly mundane, but it warps the process in favor of wealthier kids who can send in early-decision applications to selective schools without fretting about the size of the financial-aid package they'll receive.\n\nIn a recently published study in the Harvard Educational Review, Hextrum interviewed 47 athletes at an unnamed elite, Division I college about how they earned a coveted spot at the university. As she writes, there are all sorts of hidden advantages that \"secure greater access to elite colleges for white middle-class communities via athletic participation.\" Athletes often get noticed by making visits to the college and sending coaches intensely curated portfolios highlighting their prowess. Affluent kids, \"due to their community and social networks, are better at navigating this process,\" she told me. And in some cases, she found, cozy relationships between high-school and college coaches can facilitate access for students: \"There were instances where if you knew someone who knew someone, you could use that advantage to get a shortcut route into athletics.\"\n\nAt schools like the University of Alabama and Ohio State University with storied teams that gin up media attention rivaling the big leagues, athletics is a cash cow: In 2017, the Ohio State athletics program brought in $167 million in revenue. Yet, according to the NCAA , at all but 20 colleges, athletics programs lose more money than they make. That raises a baffling question: Why are colleges willing to lower their admissions standards to recruit the best athletes when their expensive sports programs are unlikely to return the investment?\n\nFor some colleges, it's a ploy to burnish their national reputation by getting their name out there, on the field or on the court. And, in some cases, it works: After Florida Gulf Coast University made a David-and-Goliath-like run to the March Madness Sweet 16 in 2013, the school saw a 27.5 percent jump in applicants the following year.\n\nRead: The March Madness application bump\n\nIncidental marketing aside, sports can also make a college seem more attractive to its students. Athletics, Thelin says, \"is one of the few unifying activities that can bring the school together. Football, especially.\" And, he told me, college sports can nurture loyalty to an institution years after a student leaves campus, and perhaps inspire one to donate money to the school.\n\nBut how many people are really going to lacrosse games and sailing meets and the other sporting events that don't typically have graduates reaching for their checkbook? Part of it is the power of tradition: For more than a century, colleges-starting with elite schools in the Northeast-have fixated on physical activity and sports as a way to mold young, impressionable students to their making. That continues today: \"Strong academic colleges often like to at least offer the prospect of the sound mind, sound body,\" Thelin says. And, still, colleges need to field a minimum number of sports to join a particular conference, such as the Ivy League, which prevents them from putting all their cards on the table for high-profile sports exclusively.\n\nAs Harvard's admission policies go through the wringer, college sports has largely evaded scrutiny, even among the plaintiffs accusing the school of discrimination. \"People are complaining about minority students,\" Hernandez says, \"but athletes are taking up almost a fifth of the class [at Harvard], and they're lowering the academic standards quite a bit.\"\n\nGranted, athletes at elite schools are far from brain-dead jocks-they work long, grueling hours to balance their academic workload with games, practices, and travel, and have to maintain a certain grade point average to stay eligible to play their sport. But, as the Harvard case seems poised to inch its way to the Supreme Court, where a majority of justices could roll back affirmative action, it's worth considering how other admissions practices put a thumb on the scale for white students. The processes that funnel rich white athletes to selective colleges aren't going anywhere in the short term, but in a possible future in which colleges can no longer consider race in admissions, there could be renewed public pressure for these schools to clear the musty cobwebs of the admissions process that undermine their self-proclaimed ethos as America's engines of social mobility.\n\n\"It's curious to me that these elite universities are holding on to these policies, because I think they expose the contradictions of what universities do in admissions,\" says the Harvard professor Natasha Warikoo. \"They're blatantly privileging already privileged groups.\"\n\nUpdate: This article has been updated to remove identifying information about a student athlete, to protect his privacy."

      "text": "Dope : When High-School Hijinks Are Life-or-Death\n\nRick Famuyiwa's uproarious film makes most other coming-of-age comedies seem like gentle fantasies.\n\nDope opens by showing the dictionary-style definitions of the movie's title-essentially drugs, dumbass, and cool. But the real keyword for Rick Famuyiwa's breakout Sundance comedy is on the posters: \"It's hard out here for a geek.\" \"Geek\" is how the hero, Malcolm, is labeled by himself and the people around him. Which might prompt some skepticism. Are we still making movies about jocks vs. nerds? Didn't dissing geeks go out in 1985 ? I remember arriving at high school a certified geek and being surprised that the coming-of-age movies I'd seen had greatly exaggerated the teenage caste system-no one was stuffing anyone in lockers for knowing the order of operations.\n\nA few minutes into Dope , though, and you realize that the rules are slightly different for this particular entry into the high-school movies tradition. Yes, like so many other films, it's about uncool kids falling in with the cool kids and then having their values tested. Yes, Malcolm and his best friends Diggy and Jib worry about bullies, prom dates, and getting into college. At first, it might seem like the movie's novelty is merely because of racial transposition-maybe it's a black Breakfast Club , where the geeks' geekdom mostly comes from their love of '90s hip hop and \"white shit.\"\n\nBut the locker-lined hallways depicted in the film are fundamentally different from the ones populating John Hughes films, Superbad , and Mean Girls , less because of the color shift than because of what this particular color shift means in the real world. Being a geek here isn't just about being obsessed with unpopular stuff; it's about opting out from cultural expectations as a way to try and survive. Early in the film, it's established that in the low-income neighborhood of \"the Bottoms\" in Inglewood, the drug trade is an inescapable part of the social scene, and anyone can be killed for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. This isn't presented as a big, dramatic stakes-raiser, but rather as a simple fact, as it is for so many Americans. And as with so many simple, horrible facts, it becomes a source of grim humor. A student gets shot during a robbery at a burger shack, and the real tragedy, the narrator says, is that he was seconds away from defeating a level on his Game Boy.\n\nDespite the armor of geekdom-which makes him either invisible or a joke to most of the people around him-Malcolm unwittingly ends up with a stash of molly and must figure out how to sell it, all the while trying to land the cute girl down the street and mail his application to Harvard. In the process, he tiptoes through gang war zones, allies with a rich white stoner who wants permission to use the N-word, nearly loses his virginity to a character played by the model Chanel Iman, and has the strangest college-admissions interview of all time. If that all sounds like mere hijinks, remember: The guys of 21 Jump Street might get chased by drug dealers or the kids of Dazed & Confused might get roughed up by upperclassmen, but you never really worry anyone's going to die. Here, as is the case with the other cinematic traditions Dope pulls heavily from -the gangster-narratives of the '90s like Boys N the Hood and Juice- bloodshed's plenty likely. This means you watch all the hijinks unfold with a heightened level of attention, a queasy and bracing mix of amusement and dread.\n\nIt helps that the writing is hilarious and dense, delivered with ace comic performances and energetic, fearless style. The 20-year-old Shameik Moore plays Malcolm, emanating natural charisma while also mumbling and stumbling as is appropriate for his character. His pal Diggy, played by Kiersey Clemons, nearly steals the movie as a clever but no-nonsense lesbian, and the rapper A$AP Rocky brings a surprising amount of easy wit as well as danger to his performance as the drug dealer Dom. The pacing's uneven-contemplative one minute, frenetic the next-but deliberately so, and the effect is almost musical.\n\nIt should be obvious by now that in addition to revitalizing a genre, Dope has a social message about being true to yourself and about transcending one's circumstances without leaving them behind or condemning them. And it joyfully humanizes a group of people too often left to grim stereotyping in pop culture. Forest Whitaker's hammy narration, and a recitation of Malcolm's college admission essay toward the end of the movie, puts too fine a point on the film's politics. But whenever the energy starts to flag or it tempts preachiness, Dope quickly recovers, often with help the soundtrack-a mix of classic and contemporary hip hop plus catchy post-punk from the geeks' band Awreeoh, whose songs are ghostwritten by the film's co-executive producer Pharrell. One of Awreeoh's earworms is called \"Can't Bring Me Down,\" and if that title sounds trite, by the end of the film, in the context of these geeks' lives and the reality they represent, it seems anything but."

      "text": "'The White Lotus,' Daphne, and the Luxury of Delusion\n\nMoney may not bring happiness, but it can buy the next-best thing.\n\nThis is a subscriber-only edition of Humans Being, a newsletter that unearths deeper meanings in pop culture.\n\nWhen I was in grad school, I worked part-time for a wealthy family. I tutored in their Manhattan home, a beautiful place on the Upper East Side. They also owned a weekend home at the tip of Long Island. They often invited me to fancy events. They gave me free passes to practically every museum in the city. I was welcome to their refrigerator during the 15 hours a week that I worked there. And I was grateful, not only for their kindness, but because I was completely poor. My monthly food budget was something like $100 at the time, and I survived by eating pasta every day at home and discreetly eating a ton of free food at theirs. When their housekeeper visited each week, I wondered if she did the same.\n\nThe housekeeper would bring her elementary-school-aged daughter to her shifts, and I would play with the daughter while having conversations with her mom. I can't remember what we talked about, only that it was never about the family that we worked for. I don't know if we were afraid of hidden cameras, or worried that someone would overhear, or if we just felt more appreciative than resentful of their wealth, but our conversations ignored that we were two poor people of color working as The Help for rich white people.\n\nBut we did have a look. We shared the look whenever we noticed something that seemed especially rich and white, raising our eyebrows with a smirk and a shrug. Money strewn about on the floor? Gesture, smirk, and shrug. A $15 price sticker on a four-ounce container of pistachios? Gesture, smirk, and shrug. The look asked, \"Who lives like this?\" and \"Do they have any idea how wild that is?\" It said, \"Rich people live on another planet.\" Who spends $15 on four ounces of pistachios?\n\nI spent much of my life as a poor Black kid surrounded by rich white people, and I often wonder about their sense of reality. The allure of lifestyle porn in TV and movies is that it offers insight into how rich people live and think, and allows me the fantasy of knowing what it's like-but feeling confident that I still have my working-class grip on how the world works for most people. You may not be surprised that I love The White Lotus .\n\nThe primary theme of HBO's hit drama, which collected 10 Emmys earlier this year, is that rich people are deeply unhappy despite their privilege, and that they will search for solutions to their misery in paradisiacal vacation resorts. My favorite motif of the show, though, is that most people who are accustomed to wealth lack even a shred of self-awareness, and those who do see through the existential misery still choose the delusion. The realization that people can still be unhappy in paradise is too much for the characters to bear, and as a result, the wealthy people escape to another reality.\n\nIn Season 1, one of the characters we follow is Rachel, who slowly recognizes the warped reality of the rich. She is an anchor for the audience, hating the bizarro world of the vapid and rich-but eventually choosing to join it. In the second season, which just ended, Daphne represents a natural progression of someone who recognizes the delusions of the rich but goes beyond accepting it to fully embracing what it has to offer.\n\nDaphne and her husband, Cameron, are seemingly among the happiest of the rich people. But Daphne in particular has a clear understanding of why she's so happy: Everyone, no matter how many advantages they have, feels like a victim, so she chooses to do whatever she needs to balance the scales. Daphne practices a type of hedonistic justice, where her privileges-being wealthy, young, beautiful, white-buy her way out of existential crises. Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy delusion ... and that's close enough.\n\nDaphne and Cameron's friend couple, Harper and Ethan, are new to being rich, with Ethan having sold his company in a multimillion-dollar windfall. While much of Harper and Ethan's plot centers on their relationship-their jealousy and their dying sex life-my favorite part of their character arcs was seeing how they would navigate being \"new money.\" They think that they're different from those rich people, and Harper repeatedly describes Ethan as being \"the same,\" unchanged by becoming rich. The irony of repeating that compliment on the beach of a five-star White Lotus resort is lost on them, signifying the change already taking place. Like Rachel in Season 1, Ethan eventually faces a symbolic decision: He's aware enough to see the miseries of the rich, and must choose whether to embrace Daphne's hedonistic justice.\n\nRich people in The White Lotus live at the expense of others, but the real prize of their wealth is the luxury of delusion. Working-class and poor people can only hope to benefit by taking advantage of rich people's dreams about how happiness really works. And when given the choice between facing problems without money or embracing the delusions that wealth affords, people will almost always choose to be rich.\n\nAnd if you can't be rich, you can gesture, smirk, and shrug.\n\nI like to think that if I was suddenly wealthy, I would keep my grip on reality. But maybe that's delusional, too, if only because I do in some way dream of being rich. The housekeeper and I shrugged, smirked, and wondered, Who lives like this? But we always ate the pistachios. And we loved them.\n\n***\n\nThanks to everyone who responded to my last Humans Being, about culture influencers and Twitter .

      "text": "Poor Black Kids Are Doing Better. Poor White Kids Are Doing Worse.\n\nA major study reports good and bad news.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nThis is Work in Progress, a newsletter about work, technology, and how to solve some of America's biggest problems. Sign up here .\n\nThe yawning gap between the mobility of white children and Black children growing up in low-income families has narrowed sharply, according to a major new study released today , based on tens of millions of anonymized census and tax records. Yet the findings are not entirely comforting. Inequality narrowed not just because poor Black kids have grown up to earn more as adults but also because poor white kids are earning less.\n\nChildren born in lower-income white families did not fall behind just relative to the gains made by their higher-income white peers or their peers in Black families across the income spectrum. They fell behind in absolute terms. Poor white kids born in 1992 were earning $1,530 less at age 27 than poor white kids born in 1978, after accounting for inflation. Fewer were married, fewer had graduated from college, and more were incarcerated too. Poor Black kids born in 1992, on the other hand, were making $1,607 more than those born in '78. As a result of these simultaneous shifts, the chance of Black and white kids leaving the lowest-earning income quintile and reaching the middle class converged.\n\nFrom the August 2019 issue: The economist who would fix the American dream\n\nThe rising inequality among white families and the entrenchment of poverty in low-income white communities is sobering. Yet the gains among Black families are remarkable, given how deep-rooted and long-standing racial inequality is in American life. The study's takeaway is that opportunity is \"malleable\" in a short time frame, Raj Chetty, an economist and one of the paper's authors, told me. \"The reason the U.S. has had such persistent gaps by race in terms of income, wealth, health-whatever disparity you're interested in-is because we basically have had no change in terms of rates of mobility,\" he told me. But if the trends in this paper continue, within a few generations, Black families \"will see a catch-up phenomenon.\"\n\nThere is a lot of catching up to do: The United States is an intensely unequal place, and as a result, its rates of intergenerational mobility are low. Americans in the top 1 percent of the earnings spectrum make 22 times as much as those in the bottom 10 percent. The disparity is even greater in terms of wealth: The top decile of households accounts for 67 percent of the country's net worth, and the bottom 50 percent just 2.5 percent.\n\nClass is strongly heritable : A kid born in the bottom quintile of the earnings distribution has a 43 percent chance of remaining there; a kid born in the top quintile has a 40 percent chance of staying there. The top of the income distribution remained ossified in the new study: Rich white kids are overwhelmingly likely to remain rich, and rich Black kids somewhat less so.\n\n\"Change in these sorts of fundamental, structural problems is glacial,\" David Grusky of Stanford, who was not involved in the study but reviewed the findings, told me. The change found in this study-both the \"important\" narrowing of the racial gap and the \"horrible\" expansion of the class gap-\"is not glacial. It's quite prominent.\"\n\nEarlier studies by Chetty and others have shown that upward mobility is much likelier for Hispanic and white kids than for Black and Native American kids, and downward mobility much likelier for Black and Native kids than for white and Hispanic kids. Inequality on class and racial lines remains a central feature of American economic life, the new paper finds: \"Black children born in 1992 in counties with the highest levels of upward mobility for Black children still have poorer outcomes in adulthood on average than white children born in counties with the lowest levels of upward mobility for white children.\"\n\nStill, some large and persistent gaps are closing, and fast. The new study-by Chetty, Sonya Porter of the Census Bureau, and Will Dobbie, Benjamin Goldman, and Crystal Yang, all of Harvard-finds that kids born in low-income Black families in 1978 were 14.7 percentage points likelier to remain low-income than their white peers. In the 1992 cohort, they were just 4.1 percentage points likelier to do so.\n\nNeither governmental programs nor labor-market conditions precipitated the mobility changes among low-income households, the paper finds. The changes seemed to have little to do with choices made by families themselves, either. Much of the data \"can be explained by a single variable,\" Chetty told me. \"White kids were increasingly growing up in communities where low-income parents were not working.\" That was not true of Black kids, who in both cohorts were growing up in neighborhoods where parents might not be earning much but were likely to be employed.\n\nRead: The secret to reclaiming the American dream\n\nThe paper shows the employment rate of low-income white parents dropped from 66.2 percent to 55.8 percent between the 1978 and 1992 cohorts; for low-income Black parents, it declined a far smaller amount, from 74.9 percent to 71.3 percent. (The study finds that it was not just kids whose parents were unemployed who had lower earnings at age 27; kids with employed parents did as well. In other words, the issue was the neighborhood, not the specific family circumstances.) The authors also found a sharp increase in the rate at which poor white parents were dying, from 4.2 percent in the 1978 cohort to 5.8 percent in the 1992 cohort. The mortality rate remained stable for poor Black parents, moving from 4.8 to 5 percent.\n\nThe study does not emphasize broad geographic trends; this is not about the decline of the Rust Belt, or poverty in Appalachia, or increasing inequality in superstar cities. Rather, it shows that race gaps grew smaller and class gaps grew wider across metro areas, neighborhood by neighborhood. The lesson for policy makers is that communities matter-not just in terms of wealth or public resources but in terms of social capital and societal expectations.\n\n\"I describe place-based policies as one of the most important early-childhood interventions,\" John Lettieri, the president of the Economic Innovation Group, a Washington-based think tank, told me. \"Neighborhood conditions are an early-childhood intervention, positive or negative, shaping what a child is going to become. Think of those early impressions: What is an adult? What does an adult do? How do adults behave? What kind of opportunities are people engaging in? That all happens silently,\" he said. \"But kids pick up on it.\""

      "text": "Rich, White, Healthy People Are Most Likely to Hate Obamacare\n\nAnd people who benefit from the law are more likely to view it negatively than positively\n\nWe don't always like the policies that help us. The stimulus , which is deeply unpopular even though it arguably saved the economy, is one example. And that's also true of Obamacare, even among the people who have benefited from the healthcare system's overhaul.\n\nThe Urban Institute just released a new analysis of a survey of 8,000 adults conducted in September, and, unsurprisingly, there's not a lot of love for the Affordable Care Act.\n\nForty-one percent of respondents had an unfavorable view of Obamacare, compared with 28 percent who had a favorable view, and 30 percent who had no opinion. Here's a breakdown of everyone who has an unfavorable view, by demographic:\n\nLet's look at the findings one by one:\n\nAmericans most likely to have an unfavorable view of the ACA are in the middle- and higher- income groups, have private insurance, are in very good/excellent health, are white, and live in rural areas.\n\nThis gets at the idea that Obamacare is, in a way, redistributive-it's a transfer of wealth from the healthy to the unhealthy. If you're healthy, you might not have \"needed\" health insurance before, but you're now required to have it or pay a fine. And among those who already had insurance, 4.7 million people received letters saying that their private insurance had been cancelled in the wake of the law's implementation, mostly because the law puts new requirements on what health plans must cover.\n\nBut keep in mind that \"healthy\" and \"unhealthy\" are categories that hinge on fate. You can get hit by a bus even if you never touch potato chips and run marathons every year. So you can think of this as a transfer from the lucky to the unlucky , as Jonathan Cohn put it. Rich white people (a.k.a. historically lucky people) are not happy about this.\n\nThose living in states that have adopted the Medicaid expansion or that have a state-based Marketplace were less likely to have an unfavorable opinion of the law than those living in other states.\n\nAlso logical: States that set up their own exchanges and adopted the Medicaid expansion are more likely to be Democratic and supportive of the law in general. And those states have been promoting the law more actively.\n\nOkay, then there's this one. People who have benefited from at least one Obamacare provision are still more likely to view the law negatively:\n\nLarge proportions of uninsured adults, particularly whites and middle-income adults, were more likely to have an unfavorable than a favorable opinion of the law. In addition, the uninsured most likely to benefit from the ACA (e.g., lower- and middle-income adults, including nonwhites and Hispanics) expressed only weak support for it and were more likely to have no opinion than to have a favorable view ... Those most likely to have no opinion are the groups most likely to benefit from the law-those in fair/poor health, those with lower incomes, the uninsured, nonwhites and Hispanics, high school graduates (or less), and the young.\n\nTo the Obama administration, this statistic must be like what it feels like to scrape your pennies together to buy your kid a bicycle, only to find that he wants to play with the box instead. The very people this law was designed to help are \"meh\" about it. Obamacare was for the uninsured people! Specifically for low-income uninsured people who now qualify for subsidies on the individual market and can't be denied coverage.\n\nPeople seem to either be unaware that they benefit from Obamacare, or they are aware that it helps them, but they're ambivalent about it nonetheless. The Urban Institute suggests that, \"public education and outreach efforts are falling well short of reaching and informing the ACA target populations who stand to benefit from the coverage provisions.\"\n\nObama officially embraced the term Obamacare in March 2012. But judging by these numbers, perhaps it's time for another rebranding. Here are some suggestions that would all have higher approval ratings, any of which I am happy to license for a small fee:\n\nFreedomCare\n\nFeelFreetoGoBaseJumpingNowCare\n\nSorryAboutYourCanceledPolicyCare\n\nFortheLastTime,ThereAreNoDeathPanelsCare\n\nMedicare\n\nZumba"

      "text": "The Many Lives of Adrienne Rich\n\nPraised by W. H. Auden as neat and modest, she vowed to be passionate and radical instead.\n\nI n 1952 , in her native Baltimore, Adrienne Rich delivered her first public lecture, \"Some Influences of Poetry Upon the Course of History.\" She was 23. Over the next 59 years, Rich (1929-2012) would herself alter both poetry and history. As an author, a teacher, and an editor, she helped define American feminism. As a poet, she left a stack of books that are animated by anger, by self-reproach, by deep knowledge of the poetic traditions she often rejected, and by her fierce desire to be understood. She created, and illuminated, divisions-within her readers as much as among them-as she reversed and revised her life's goals.\n\nThe simplest story about those goals-and it's not wrong-presents an obedient daughter and a young mother, rewarded early for talent, radicalized in middle age. Adrienne's father, Arnold, was a prestigious pathologist at Johns Hopkins University and a WASP-passing Jewish man. An \"absolute authority\" in his own home, as Rich wrote, Arnold required his wife, Helen, to wear the black crepe dress he designed for her, day after day, year after year. Helen, a trained pianist and composer, threw herself into Adrienne's music lessons (she was playing Mozart by age 4); Arnold, into her literary education, neglecting her younger sister, Cynthia. When Arnold died in 1968, Hilary Holladay writes in her capacious, generous biography, The Power of Adrienne Rich , Rich had \"spent her life becoming the accomplished poet he wanted her to be.\" She had also \"hated him for a long time.\"\n\nRich was driven and admired, though never popular, in her all-girls high school. She enrolled at Radcliffe (then Harvard's college for women) seeking a husband and a literary career. The \"self-possessed and proper\" Adrienne impressed professors, among them the poet Theodore Morrison and the renowned F. O. Matthiessen, an authority on American literature and a gay socialist. She also became engaged to a graduate student in history, Sumner Powell. Before her senior year at Radcliffe, Rich had completed the manuscript W. H. Auden chose for the Yale Younger Poets prize. His foreword to A Change of World (1951) praised the undergraduate's \"neatly and modestly\" finished work. Writing to her family, Rich resolved to be \"messily passionate and grand\" instead.\n\nFrom the June 1959 issue: 'Exodus,' a poem by Adrienne Rich\n\nThe Yale book made Rich a well-mannered wunderkind; it also led to a Guggenheim-funded year at Oxford, with travels on the European Continent (de rigueur for her poetic generation). A poem from The Diamond Cutters and Other Poems (1955) suggested more unruly ferment; set at Versailles, it augured great change (such as the French Revolution) for \"all good children who are all too good.\" Before Rich moved overseas, she left Powell cold. She then fell hard for Alfred Conrad, whose Jewish background repelled Arnold. \"I didn't know a great deal about him,\" remembered the poet Donald Hall, who knew Rich at Harvard and Oxford, \"but I knew he was an economist and I knew she loved him-and I knew that her father disapproved.\"\n\nWhen she returned, the pair married and settled in Cambridge, where they enjoyed a Harvard-centric social world at once comfortable and stifling. \"She had a script to follow,\" as Holladay writes: that of young faculty wife. As her first two children, David and Pablo, neared school age, Rich found herself pregnant with a third, Jacob. She nonetheless managed to enter the Boston University-based literary circles of Robert Lowell, Anne Sexton, and Sylvia Plath. Rich \"advised Sylvia very strongly not to have children.\" Poems in free verse about feeling trapped in a household, about being a woman in a male-dominated world, opened Snapshots of a Daughter-in-Law (1963). In the title poem, angels tell the writer at the kitchen sink, \" Be insatiable ... Save yourself; others you cannot save .\"\n\nNonetheless, she tried. The family spent a year happily in Rotterdam, where Rich acquired her strong interest in translation; renditions of Dutch poems conclude Necessities of Life (1966), whose signature poem envisions New England settlers \"starved, intense,\" \"lonely,\" \"each with his God-given secret, / spelled out through months of snow.\" Denied tenure twice at Harvard, Conrad in 1966 took a job at the City University of New York. Rich went with him, \"vigilant mom by day, chain-smoking, hard-drinking poet by night\" in Manhattan and in their vacation house in Vermont. CUNY expected Conrad's energies to go into its new doctorate program in economics. Instead, he threw himself into activism: against campus racism, for open admissions, against the Vietnam War.\n\nRich shared his confrontational politics. \"Even to hope is to leap into the unknown,\" she mused in Leaflets (1969), \"under the mocking eyes of the way things are.\" And yet she found it hard to share his life. She recalled in an interview, \"Essential portions of me were dying.\" \"She couldn't get him to talk to her,\" Holladay writes. In New York (and perhaps earlier), Rich and Conrad decided to open up their marriage, and her lovers included Robert Lowell. She had no sense of herself as attracted to women until after Conrad's death. In July 1970, Rich told him she was moving out; three months afterward, she wrote in her poem \"Sources,\" Conrad \"drove to Vermont in a rented car at dawn and shot himself.\"\n\nReactions to that loss, and attempts to move past it, energized Diving Into the Wreck (1973), a book widely recognized for its bold commitment to women's liberation. Though W. B. Yeats was no feminist, Rich's career now seems Yeatsian-early fame; complex private life (with a hinge in her 40s); shifting styles, each a reproach to the last. She could have said, as he did, that each time she changed her approach to verse, \"it is myself that I remake.\" Holladay singles out a poem from Wreck called, simply, \"Song,\" where the poet stands\n\nBefore Wreck , Rich was an eminent left-wing poet. After it, she was a public figure, showing other women hurt by patriarchy, by domestic isolation, by competition, how to claim submerged selves, how to read the \"book of myths / in which / our names do not appear.\" She had changed herself, even saved herself. Now she wanted to change the world. Holladay devotes perhaps too many pages to Rich's star turn at the 1974 National Book Awards, where she, Audre Lorde, and Alice Walker together accepted her prize on behalf of \"all the women.\" But the fame was real: For decades, her readings filled auditoriums.\n\nIt was after Wreck that Rich came out, first to friends, then with her 1976 chapbook \"Twenty-One Love Poems,\" among the first well-known openly lesbian love poems in modern America. Rich's first lesbian partners included the activist poet June Jordan and ( after they sparred in print ) Susan Sontag. A light sense of unaddressed controversies, of material withheld, lingers over Holladay's treatment of those years. Yet she resolves the greatest mystery in Rich's career, the identity of the lover in \"Twenty-One Love Poems.\" The woman who inspired such passionate words, Lilly Engler, refused to come out, let alone make the romance public. And no wonder: Engler was Rich's psychiatrist-she could have lost her practice and her license. The relationship lasted less than a year. \"These are the forces we had ranged within us,\" the love poems conclude, \"within us and against us, against us and within us.\" Rich could have meant everything from shyness, to coyness, to therapeutic ethics, to internalized or society-wide homophobia.\n\nBy this time, the poet craved not just same-sex love, but communities made by and for women. Rich diminished or cut off contact with prominent men and refused to take questions from men in her audiences. Her poems sought historical parallels in women mountain climbers, in neglected artists, in Marie Curie. Holladay asserts, a bit defensively, that the poet was no dogmatic separatist: \"All Rich wanted was a break\" from men. Even before she bought a house in Massachusetts, the social and intellectual center of her life had begun to shift to the Pioneer Valley, around Amherst and Northampton, a lesbian destination then as now. Holladay's sources for these years include Janice Raymond, whose egregiously influential 1979 book, The Transsexual Empire , argued that transgender women are not really women and should not exist. Rich's role in its writing-and her attitudes toward trans people (did they change?)-go unmentioned. We do, however, see Rich change her mind about other things. Once active, with Raymond and Catharine MacKinnon, in anti-pornography campaigns, Rich in 1985 switched sides: \"Laws intended to punish pornographers would harm women whose sexual desires fell outside the perceived norm.\"\n\nRich owed her eminence not only to her poetry but to essays such as \"Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence\" (1980), and to her book-length polemic about \"motherhood as experience and institution,\" Of Woman Born (1976). Rich's copy editor for that book was a younger writer, the Jamaican poet and novelist Michelle Cliff; they fell in love. Rich settled down with Cliff for the rest of her life, first in New York; then in western Massachusetts, where the pair ran the lesbian feminist journal Sinister Wisdom ; and from 1984 on in Santa Cruz, California. Volatile, and sometimes prickly about her lesser fame, Cliff nonetheless made a strong partner for Rich. Santa Cruz neighbors remember the couple as welcoming, warm, and reliable, and as avid fans of the sitcom The Golden Girls .\n\nAnchored in life, Rich the writer remained unsatisfied, and uncompromising, in literary matters. She told the poet Hayden Carruth in 1971 of a \"hunger that seems almost ... to be who I am .\" Rich assembled a controversial-and wonderful-1996 edition of Best American Poetry with work from teenagers and prisoners (as well as from the usual poetic suspects). Devoted to an ideal of integrity, she had trouble expressing gratitude, lest any kindness seem transactional. In Holladay's telling, she kept friends close for decades, but could drop them without warning. With Carruth, it's a wonder she took so long; their \"intimate, almost entirely epistolary friendship\" could not survive his resistance to her feminism. Audre Lorde took on a similar role-close in every way except physical sex-in Rich's later life. \"You have climbed into my poems,\" Rich wrote to Lorde, \"and, in less visible ways, I have perhaps climbed into yours.\" Their friendship surfaced questions she felt she needed to ask herself about her relationships with other Black women.\n\nRich also asked herself what to do as a Jew. \"Yom Kippur 1984\" found her \"trying to say / that to be with my people is my dearest wish / but that I also love strangers / that I crave separateness.\" Holladay remarks that Rich \"made a Talmud out of her life.\" Capacious sequences, ragged stand-alone lyric poems, and pages that read like notebook entries, in books like Time's Power (1989) and Midnight Salvage (1999), revealed a writer still arguing with herself, trying \"to give up power for the greater good,\" reaching out internationally, rejecting earlier efforts to speak for all women. And if the late prose turned glib, the verse remained profound. The lead poem in Fox (2003), dedicated to the HIV-positive poet Tory Dent , addressed readers everywhere:\n\nFew readers knew Rich's own pain: It literally hurt to be her. (The \"foils,\" above, are hypodermics.) Diagnosed at 22 with rheumatoid arthritis, she kept her condition private for decades; \"acute suffering could occur at any time,\" Holladay writes. In 1969 she declined to attend a march, worried that she would slow her companions down. She used canes and wheelchairs beginning in the early 1980s, if not earlier; onstage, \"she did not appear strong until she spoke.\" The New England chill made her arthritis worse-one reason Rich and Cliff chose California. In a metaphor almost too good to be true, a 1992 spinal operation required Rich to wear, all day and all night, a metal \"halo screwed into her head.\"\n\nThe halo, of course, also meant she needed help. Rich's mature writings, verse and prose, insisted on interdependence, attacking the systems that separate women from women, rich white people from all the rest. And yet her writings stood out. \"It's an oldfashioned, an outrageous thing,\" Rich mused in the '80s, \"to believe one has a 'destiny.' \" But she felt she did: \"The faithful drudging child / the child at the oak desk ... becomes the woman with a mission.\" People who have read few books of poetry have read Diving Into the Wreck ; people otherwise untouched by feminist theory have led lives improved by her prose. And people who have read many poems, and many poets, can still find little-known gems of introspection, ways to look outside our personal bubbles, to remake ourselves, in the complexities of her work.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "College Sports Are Affirmative Action for Rich White Students\n\nAthletes are often held to a lower standard by admissions officers, and in the Ivy League, 65 percent of players are white.\n\nQuick, think of a college athlete. Chances are the person who comes to mind is a football or basketball player at a powerhouse Division I school like Louisiana State University or the University of Kentucky. Maybe the player resembles, say, Joel Embiid, who turned a chiseled, 7-foot frame into a full-ride scholarship at the University of Kansas before ascending to NBA stardom.\n\nBut the typical student athlete more often plays a less blockbuster sport-lacrosse, maybe, or tennis-and in many cases comes from a well-to-do family that has shelled out thousands and thousands of dollars over the years to nurture a budding athletic talent. And a majority of the time, they're white.\n\nThe most visible college athletes-the ones running across bar-TV screens or in full-color photographs on newspaper sports pages-tend to be black. Indeed, college football and basketball players skew disproportionately African American. But, says Kirsten Hextrum, a professor of educational leadership at the University of Oklahoma, \"the black men in these two sports are not the reality of who has access to college sports.\"\n\nBy the National Collegiate Athletic Association's own estimate , 61 percent of student athletes last year were white. At elite colleges, that number is even higher: 65 percent in the Ivy League, not including international students, and 79 percent in the Division III New England Small College Athletic Conference, which includes elite liberal-arts colleges like Williams College and Amherst College. As Harvard heads to court to fend off allegations that it discriminates against Asian American applicants , the plaintiffs behind the case have released to the public reams and reams of data analyzing the school's admissions process. They allege that one factor used in admissions, called \"personal rating,\" systematically disadvantages Asian American students. But tucked into the 168-page analysis of Harvard's admissions data is a curious statistic about another nonacademic factor considered by the school: athletics.\n\nAll applicants to Harvard are ranked on a scale of one to six based on their academic qualifications, and athletes who scored a four were accepted at a rate of about 70 percent. Yet the admit rate for nonathletes with the same score was 0.076 percent-nearly 1,000 times lower. Similarly, 83 percent of athletes with a top academic score got an acceptance letter, compared with 16 percent of nonathletes. Legacy admissions policies get a lot of flak for privileging white applicants, but athletes have a much bigger effect on admissions, and make up a much bigger percentage of the class. And it's not just Harvard-in 2002, James Schulman and former Princeton University President William Bowen looked at 30 selective colleges and found that athletes were given a 48 percent boost in admissions, compared with 25 percent for legacies and 18 percent for racial minorities.\n\nRead: What the Harvard trial is really about\n\nPut another way, college sports at elite schools are a quiet sort of affirmative action for affluent white kids, and play a big role in keeping these institutions so stubbornly white and affluent. What makes this all the more perplexing, says John Thelin, a historian of higher education at the University of Kentucky, is that \"no other nation has the equivalent of American college sports.\" It's a particular quirk of the American higher-education system that ultimately has major ramifications for who gets in-and who doesn't-to selective colleges.\n\nWhen it comes to college athletics, football and basketball command the most public attention, but in the background is a phalanx of lower-profile sports favored by white kids, which often cost a small fortune for a student participating at a top level. Ivy League sports like sailing, golf, water polo, fencing, and lacrosse aren't typically staples of urban high schools with big nonwhite populations; they have entrenched reputations as suburban, country-club sports. According to the NCAA, of the 232 Division I sailors last year, none were black. Eighty-five percent of college lacrosse players were white, as well as 90 percent of ice-hockey players.\n\nAnd the cost of playing these sports can be sky high. \"There are high economic barriers to entering in this highly specialized sports system,\" Hextrum says. \"White people are concentrated in areas that are resource rich and have greater access to those economic resources.\" Getting good enough at a sport to have a shot at playing collegiately often necessitates coaching, summer camps, traveling for tournaments, and a mountain of equipment. One in five families of an elite high-school athlete spend $1,000 a month on sports-the average family of a lacrosse player spends nearly $8,000 a year. Kids from low-income families participate in youth sports at almost half the rate of affluent families, according to a report from the Aspen Institute. It's no surprise, then, that per The Harvard Crimson 's annual freshman survey, 46.3 percent of recruited athletes in the class of 2022 hail from families with household incomes of $250,000 or higher, compared with one-third of the class as a whole.\n\nBut there are other, more veiled factors that may also boost the numbers of white college athletes. For one, many elite colleges-including Ivy League schools and smaller Division III colleges-don't offer athletic scholarships, so they can't give low-income sports stars a free ride like big, Division I schools can. Michele Hernandez Bayliss, a private college counselor and a former assistant admissions dean at Dartmouth College, walked me through the process: Over the summer, coaches compile lists of the athletes they want, which they then share with the admissions office. \"Most of the recruiting happens in the early rounds. Once coaches have their list, they would rather wrap up the whole process early rather than wait until the spring,\" Hernandez said. That the recruited athletes are chosen early on is seemingly mundane, but it warps the process in favor of wealthier kids who can send in early-decision applications to selective schools without fretting about the size of the financial-aid package they'll receive.\n\nIn a recently published study in the Harvard Educational Review, Hextrum interviewed 47 athletes at an unnamed elite, Division I college about how they earned a coveted spot at the university. As she writes, there are all sorts of hidden advantages that \"secure greater access to elite colleges for white middle-class communities via athletic participation.\" Athletes often get noticed by making visits to the college and sending coaches intensely curated portfolios highlighting their prowess. Affluent kids, \"due to their community and social networks, are better at navigating this process,\" she told me. And in some cases, she found, cozy relationships between high-school and college coaches can facilitate access for students: \"There were instances where if you knew someone who knew someone, you could use that advantage to get a shortcut route into athletics.\"\n\nAt schools like the University of Alabama and Ohio State University with storied teams that gin up media attention rivaling the big leagues, athletics is a cash cow: In 2017, the Ohio State athletics program brought in $167 million in revenue. Yet, according to the NCAA , at all but 20 colleges, athletics programs lose more money than they make. That raises a baffling question: Why are colleges willing to lower their admissions standards to recruit the best athletes when their expensive sports programs are unlikely to return the investment?\n\nFor some colleges, it's a ploy to burnish their national reputation by getting their name out there, on the field or on the court. And, in some cases, it works: After Florida Gulf Coast University made a David-and-Goliath-like run to the March Madness Sweet 16 in 2013, the school saw a 27.5 percent jump in applicants the following year.\n\nRead: The March Madness application bump\n\nIncidental marketing aside, sports can also make a college seem more attractive to its students. Athletics, Thelin says, \"is one of the few unifying activities that can bring the school together. Football, especially.\" And, he told me, college sports can nurture loyalty to an institution years after a student leaves campus, and perhaps inspire one to donate money to the school.\n\nBut how many people are really going to lacrosse games and sailing meets and the other sporting events that don't typically have graduates reaching for their checkbook? Part of it is the power of tradition: For more than a century, colleges-starting with elite schools in the Northeast-have fixated on physical activity and sports as a way to mold young, impressionable students to their making. That continues today: \"Strong academic colleges often like to at least offer the prospect of the sound mind, sound body,\" Thelin says. And, still, colleges need to field a minimum number of sports to join a particular conference, such as the Ivy League, which prevents them from putting all their cards on the table for high-profile sports exclusively.\n\nAs Harvard's admission policies go through the wringer, college sports has largely evaded scrutiny, even among the plaintiffs accusing the school of discrimination. \"People are complaining about minority students,\" Hernandez says, \"but athletes are taking up almost a fifth of the class [at Harvard], and they're lowering the academic standards quite a bit.\"\n\nGranted, athletes at elite schools are far from brain-dead jocks-they work long, grueling hours to balance their academic workload with games, practices, and travel, and have to maintain a certain grade point average to stay eligible to play their sport. But, as the Harvard case seems poised to inch its way to the Supreme Court, where a majority of justices could roll back affirmative action, it's worth considering how other admissions practices put a thumb on the scale for white students. The processes that funnel rich white athletes to selective colleges aren't going anywhere in the short term, but in a possible future in which colleges can no longer consider race in admissions, there could be renewed public pressure for these schools to clear the musty cobwebs of the admissions process that undermine their self-proclaimed ethos as America's engines of social mobility.\n\n\"It's curious to me that these elite universities are holding on to these policies, because I think they expose the contradictions of what universities do in admissions,\" says the Harvard professor Natasha Warikoo. \"They're blatantly privileging already privileged groups.\"\n\nUpdate: This article has been updated to remove identifying information about a student athlete, to protect his privacy."

      "text": "We're Living for the 'White Lotus' Rich White Ladies' Betrayals\n\n( Warning: Spoilers ahead.)\n\nGiven how much the trio of rich 40-something friends have s--t-talked behind each other's backs during their luxury vacation, it is surprising it took this long for things to blow up on The White Lotus .\n\nCompared to what some other guests are getting up to (a handy from a sibling, stealing a gun, plotting vengeance, avoiding a murderer), the blonde BFFs' conflict is rather quaint. Or, so high school. Yet, it is thrilling to see Laurie (Carrie Coon) toss the grenade into this toxic friendship. Is this the first time one of them has called Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan) out for her selfish behavior?\n\nHaving a great piece of gossip is oxygen to these women , more so when it is about one of the other two. Kate (Leslie Bibb) cannot wait to tell Laurie about witnessing Valentin's (Arnas Fedaravičius) early morning walk of shame. Even Kate's c--ty bob vibrates as she teases the big Jaclyn reveal.\n\nBibb has already showcased her Emmy-worthy condescending smile, and now she adds a cat that got the cream grin to her roster. Quickly, Kate will regret ever sharing this intel.\n\n\"It's sad. She's an aging actress. You saw her yesterday. She literally lives off male attention. It's one thing when you're 25, but now you're 45, and guess what, it's pathetic,\" Laurie says with her whole chest.\n\nLaurie, rightly, is annoyed that Jaclyn went from playing cupid to hooking up with Valentin: \"She has not changed at all. She is exactly the same. That is so psycho.\" I don't think I have seen anyone cut fruit with quite this much vigor, and while we're throwing out new Emmy subcategories, Coon deserves one for this breakfast display.\n\nBecause she shuts down at the slightest friction, Kate backtracks, saying she thought Laurie would find it funny. Kate is lying or deluded if she thinks Laurie would be chill-or perhaps she figured Laurie would fall in line. 'I'm laughing. It's funny. HA,\" says Laurie. Spoiler: She is not laughing.\n\nLater, when the trio is sunbathing, Laurie stage whispers to Kate that she needs to say something because it feels fake not to. \"One person's fake is another person's, you know, good manners,\" replies Kate. Okay, I need this platitude embroidered on a cushion. When Jaclyn stirs, Kate deflects, saying they are talking about their kids.\n\nBut Laurie is done with the BS, telling Jacyln they know about her one-night stand. When she says nothing happened, Jaclyn delivers a performance she probably thinks is Oscar-worthy (People's Choice at best).\n\n\"Can I ask, and I'm just curious, why did you keep pushing him on me when it was always your plan to hook up with him yourself?\" asks Laurie. It is now Jaclyn's turn to call her friend crazy.\n\nIf she didn't already want to be erased from this narrative, Kate's bugged-out eyes scream this sentiment when Laurie drops her in it: \"When Kate told me she saw him coming out of your room this morning.\"\n\nOf all the twists and turns, Jaclyn sleeping with Valentin is the least surprising because she is that girl and always has been. Of course, this isn't me cracking a huge mystery, as Mike White lays this all out from the first episode. \"It just made me laugh. It's like nobody ever changes. We're still the same people we were in the tenth grade. It's just funny. It's funny.\" You guessed it, Laurie does not laugh\n\nEven though Jaclyn says she's \"not sure what that means,\" plenty of us have been Lauries or Kates on the other side of a Jaclyn. If socials are any indicator, instead of saying you are a Jaclyn, Kate or Laurie, these roles are some variation of \"Actress, MAGA, and Carrie Coon.\" (Dibs on Carrie Coon)\n\n\"This is what you always did. Never mind, forget it, it doesn't matter,\" Laurie announces as they return to reading-or using a book as a prop. It is also beyond telling that Jaclyn's choice is the weighty Barbra Streisand hardback memoir, which will tip those luggage scales. No doubt, Jaclyn sees herself as a Babs. For those wondering, Laurie's novel is Modern Lovers by Emma Straub.\n\nLater, Kate asks why Laurie is antagonizing Jaclyn. \"I'm not like you. Sometimes I just have to be honest,\" Laurie says. Once again, Kate grins, now mixed with a grimace.\n\nKate has one more BFF round to go, and Jaclyn goes full gaslighting: \"Do you know how much gossip I have to deal with? My own friends-the few people that I think I can trust-are talking s--t about me behind my back. It's really depressing.\" Has Jaclyn pushed it too far?\n\nOld habits die hard, but Laurie threatens the delicate ecosystem by bringing her grievance to the table instead of behind Jaclyn's back. Perhaps there will be enlightenment on this trip after all.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Give Leslie Bibb's 'White Lotus' Smile a Special Emmy Award\n\nSenior Editor, Obsessed\n\nIf you or anyone close to you is watching The White Lotus , that means that a solid 70 percent of conversations you had this week were about the dinner scene where the three rich white ladies talk about Trump . And I don't mean 70 percent of conversations about The White Lotus . I mean all topics of discussion.\n\nAnd rightfully so.\n\nI will never recover from this pic.twitter.com/ARQLvtgU9w\n\nIn the scene, Kate (Leslie Bibb), Jaclyn (Michelle Monaghan), and Laurie (Carrie Coon)-three lifelong friends reconnecting after too long apart at a wellness resort in Thailand-find their conversation turning to politics. Kate and her husband are now pillars of their community in Austin, whereas Jaclyn lives in L.A. and Laurie in NY.\n\nKate first stuns her friends with the revelation that she goes to church every Sunday. Moreover, she actually likes the conservative Texas community that religion has made her a part of. Once it comes out that Kate's husband is a Republican-to Jaclyn and Laurie's great relief, Kate swears that she's an Independent-the obvious question has to be raised: Did Kate vote for Trump?\n\nThe smile that Bibb gives in response to the question made me shriek. You could tell me the moment lasted for a split-second or for 30 minutes, and I would believe either one. What a perfect expression of smugness, exasperation, belittlement, and irritation-plus about a dozen other emotions-all at once. \"Are we really gonna talk about Trump tonight?\"\n\nSomeone on social media likened the three actresses' performances in that scene to \"a best supporting actress in a drama series Emmy-off,\" and I couldn't agree more. And while I would be hard-pressed for which woman-or their co-star, Parker Posey -would deserve a trophy more, I do have to argue for a special tribute at this year's ceremony to Bibb's smile alone.\n\nyou see they're having a best supporting actress in a drama series emmy-off here https://t.co/t1cjgLJwSu\n\nIf the Oscars can make me sit through that interminable James Bond segment , the very least the Emmys can do is this.\n\nI know God is out there looking after me, because every time the chaos of the world becomes so overwhelming, depressing, or infuriating-or, lately, a toxic combination of all three-that I want to move to a cabin in a mountain and hide away from it all forever, he throws me a little something to boost my spirits. To look forward to. To make my entire personality about for a given period of time, to the extent that my friends and family's tolerance will be truly tested.\n\nThat happened this week with the announcement that Mamma Mia! will be returning to Broadway this summer .\n\nThere is no greater experience a human can have that seeing Mamma Mia! . I have seen productions in different U.S. cities-heck, different countries, even-and can speak as an authority on this matter. Oh, you don't like musicals? You don't like ABBA? NONSENSE! Mamma Mia! is immune to such lazy dismissing. Mamma Mia! appeals to all.\n\nPictured below: Me marching everyone I know to go see Mamma Mia! on Broadway for a 14th time.\n\nI had a conversation with friends recently about how whenever someone starts a statement with the phrase, \"Now more than ever...,\" you're about to hear them say the most absolutely cringe-inducing, annoying, and quite frankly, meaningless thing. Well, friends, now more than ever, I think what the world needs is Mamma Mia!\n\nSuccession creator Jesse Armstrong is making his feature directorial debut with a new movie starring Steve Carell, Jason Schwartzman, Ramy Youssef and Cory Michael Smith. Would you believe that they will play a group of billionaire friends? Shocking subject matter for the creator of Succession .\n\nMore interesting to me is that the film will shoot in Park City, Utah, aka the ski town a stone's throw away from Salt Lake City. Jesse Armstong, if you don't seize this opportunity to populate every scene with at least one cast member from The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City , you don't have any business making this movie. Perfect entertainment is right there for you to take advantage of. It wouldn't even be hard to get them to set. Just put a bottle of Vida tequila on the craft services table, and they'll show up. Don't worry.\n\nDolly Parton 's husband of 60 years died this week. Sixty years . What a truly amazing life together. Obviously, every post Dolly has made about it has made me cry, especially this one :\n\nA post shared by Dolly Parton (@dollyparton)\n\nThe Righteous Gemstones : The final season goes out in filthy, raunchy glory .

      "text": "'The White Lotus' Season 2's Rich White People Are Even More Heinous\n\nEntertainment Reporter\n\nPop the prosecco, crack open the Aperol, and pour yourself a spritz, because The White Lotus Season 2 trailer just dropped. The crew traveled all the way to the other side of the globe this time around, settling in Sicily at another branch of the White Lotus resorts, with just one main cast member returning for the sophomore season.\n\nTanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge) , the White Lotus hotel chain's equivalent of a Disney adult, has booked yet another trip with the resort. But she's not alone anymore. Her assistant (Haley Lu Richardson) and hubby (!) Greg (Jon Gries) are all sharing a big suite together, and Greg's not happy about their lack of alone time. The whole issue, however, blows right over Tanya's head.\n\n\"Whenever I stay at the White Lotus, I always have a memorable time,\" Tanya tells her assistant. \"Always.\"\n\nJoining Tanya and her posse are a few others: one boys' trip, one couples' trip, and of course, a furious Italian concierge. The boys' trip is made up of three generations, with one horny grandpa (F. Murray Abraham), a father that's experimenting with casual sex ( Michael Imperioli ), and the son that's fed up with it all (Adam DiMarco).\n\nIn the trailer, Dominic (Imperioli) is forced to admit that women will be in and out of his hotel room throughout the duration of his stay, upsetting manager Valentina (Sabrina Impacciatore). But such is the lay of the land in Italy, where you have to check guests in and out of your hotel room every night as a part of the country's anti-terrorist laws-looks like frisky Dominic is going to be making several stops to the concierge. Jake Lacy part two?\n\nStill, he's not the only guest getting hot and heavy during his week off. New couple Harper (Aubrey Plaza) and Ethan (Will Sharpe) are joined by Cameron (Theo James) and his wife Daphne (Meghann Fahy).

      "text": "Lorde and Nicole Kidman Take on the Cult-ish Wellness Industry\n\nOn Wednesday, Hulu dropped the first three episodes of its most star-studded scripted series to date, David E. Kelley's adaptation of Liane Moriarty's bestselling novel Nine Perfect Strangers . Directed by Jonathan Levine and co-produced by Nicole Kidman , the limited series takes place in an exclusive wellness retreat where the titular guests attempt to undergo some spiritual and physical transformation, guided by a sketchy Russian guru named Masha, played by Kidman in yet another distracting wig.\n\nAs Kevin Fallon opined in his review , the series is a tonal mishmash. Despite some performances that would otherwise attract immediate awards buzz if placed in a better show, notably from Melissa McCarthy and Michael Shannon , none of them really coalesce to create a dynamic ensemble. Nor do any of these broadly written characters or the evidently fraudulent institution warrant that much intrigue. On a marketing level, the series also faces the burden of competing with the hype of HBO's just-concluded smash hit The White Lotus , which also portrays rich people swapping their privileged at-home lives for another privileged experience in an exotic location, and Kelley's previous Moriarty adaptation Big Little Lies , where his pen is far more robust.\n\nWhether or not Nine Perfect Strangers attracts the fanfare it's clamoring for with its cast of A-listers, its presence in the zeitgeist, and wonky, cult-ish portrayal of the wellness industry, along with other new media, feels indicative of a growing exhaustion and cynicism surrounding the state of self-care and wellness, particularly the ways it's manifested in American life just over the past few years, from social media to QAnon conspiracies to corporate advertising and, of course, the current pandemic.\n\nWellness-encompassing holistic practices and dubious remedies-is hardly a new phenomenon in the United States, although it feels like it's become ubiquitous over the past decade. Since colonialism, the Western world has been importing and appropriating Eastern methods of medicine and spiritual practices that are now associated with catchall terms like \"New Age,\" \"alternative medicine,\" and even \"Goop.\" Self-care as a rationalization for incorporating wellness and self-improvement into our lives also has a deeper history than the average Instagram user inundated with #selfcare sponcon would be led to believe, promoted by ancient philosophers and repopularized in political environments like the women's liberation movement of the '70s and, specifically, queer Black feminist spaces. (This is why writer and activist Audre Lorde's definition of the term is often referenced on the feminist sections of the internet.)\n\nNow more than ever, these practices and their philosophies have been detached from their histories, stripped of their nuances and monetized by corporations and upper-class white people-but most visibly in pop culture, upper-class white women. In a piece for The New Yorker , Jordan Kisner writes about the \"#selfcare-as-politics movement of 2016\" that was ironically \"powered by straight, affluent white women\" in response to Donald Trump's presidential campaign and subsequent election, a moment that awakened much of that demographic politically. Likewise, the rich white woman who collects crystals, receives sound baths and is obsessed with tarot cards and, most significantly, considers herself an expert in these customs has captured our collective attention and skepticism, from Gwyneth Paltrow and her Goop empire , Kourtney Kardashian's try at her own Goop , shows like the aforementioned Nine Perfect Strangers and Fox's Fantasy Island (although the rich woman is Latina).\n\nLorde has taken on this archetype in her new music, particularly the music video to her latest single \"Mood Ring,\" which dropped on Wednesday ahead of the release of new album Solar Power . It captures Lorde, ironically-but maybe not so ironically-donning a blonde wig like Kidman's Masha, and a group of women in jade green performing sun salutations, turning through old, spiritual texts, and playing with crystals while the 24-year-old croons about \"tryna to get well on the inside.\" This lifestyle has been so readily adopted by her ilk, particularly people in the entertainment industry, that one might miss the satirical tone in these lyrics. In her newsletter, the musician explained that the song is \"satire\" and that the narrator is fictional, although she admits that she occasionally succumbs to \"magical thinking\" when she \"need[s] to believe in something to feel good and clear.\"\n\nWhile Lorde lacks a strong rebuttal to the Gwyneth Paltrow figure-maybe because it's too close to home- the singer's analysis of wellness culture and its misappropriations feels sharper when aimed toward men. On the Solar Power song \"Dominoes,\" she lambasts the specific type of man who takes on gardening, weed, and yoga to rebrand from his toxicity and misogyny. \"It must feel good to be Mr. Start Again,\" she sings caustically. The song cleverly illustrates how goodness is often ascribed to men who associate themselves with activities that are deemed feminine within our culture. But it also gets at the way self-improvement can easily be utilized as a Band-Aid or a facade in place of doing the actual work.\n\nAs culture becomes more and more desperate for healing, whether from political divisions, as our president constantly suggests, or literal life-threatening diseases like COVID-19, the space between community and cult, non-traditional medicine and pseudoscience, self-care and individualism seems to be capturing our artistic imaginations at an extremely vital time. How can the roots of wellness be reclaimed and reasserted when it's become a $4.4 trillion money grab and employed for the most dangerous political agendas ? Lorde's Solar Power and Nine Perfect Strangers may not be perfect articulations of these quandaries, but they show how much there is to mine in that danger zone.\n\nkyndall.cunningham@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "The 'White Lotus' Rich White Ladies Are the Best Thing on Television\n\nNight News Reporter\n\nAll I care about these days are the three blonde divas on the White Lotus .\n\nArmored by Lululemon matching sets, souvenir store shawls, and a glass of wine, Michelle Monaghan, Leslie Bibb, and Carrie Coon play a devilishly dysfunctional trio of friends in this third season who are in Thailand for equal parts gossip and #meditation.\n\nIt's easy to understand how these three women, Kate (Bibb), Laurie (Coon), and Jaclyn (Monaghan), are longtime friends. They're blonde, rich, and attached by the hip. But it's when they actually start talking that the cracks in the polished friends 4 life facade, which they're so desperate to maintain while boozing in the hotel's lounge, begin to show.\n\nWith each passing episode of the White Lotus , it becomes clearer that these three women don't have all that much in common anymore, besides the weight of their shared history. In fact, the only thing they really enjoy doing together is talking absolute s*** about each other...and thank goodness for that!\n\nThe friendship is magnetic, hilarious, and terrifying all at the same time. I don't care if their relationship isn't healthy, I care about Coon and Monaghan's brilliant facial work when learning that Bibb's character was a downlow Trump supporter . These women are catty. Their conversations are inspired. And by the sheer influx of fandom they've managed to cultivate with only three episodes, it's quite clear that they're all of us.\n\nWhether or not we care to admit it, a large portion of why we all love these women is because we see ourselves (and the parts we don't like) in them. It's all too easy to Mad Libs any one of their conversations to mirror an exact after-party download you've had with one of your friends on someone or something you probably should not have been talking about like that!\n\nThere's a reason why mean girls always come in threes. While Sex and the City 's Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte have long been the friendship blueprint for the girls and the gays, the debrief-driven, Trump-talking, athleisure-wearing DNA of Kate, Laurie, and Jaclyn feel more relevant to our time than cosmo-swilling Carrie Bradshaw.\n\nSo, while I'm sure you've already discerned who in your group is the Charlotte or who's the Miranda, it is 2025 and it's okay to come out as a Jaclyn sun and Laurie rising instead. From niche interests to sex life (or lack thereof), here's how to tell who's who in your friend group: White Lotus Blonde Divas Edition.\n\nTo put it point blank, if you are a Jaclyn, you are likely a Gwyneth Paltrow wannabe.\n\nYou have definitely scrolled through Goop unironically. You have tried and failed at achieving Paltrow's effortless je ne sais quoi lifestyle of tofu and cigarettes on a budget of pre-made salad kits and vaping.\n\nIn the chance that you do have the means to afford the higher luxuries of wellness, you probably go out of your way to make sure that the TikTok following you're trying to bolster is not aware that your skin looks incredible because of a $500 moisturizer. In fact, let's all be honest here, you're more likely to tell everyone it's owed to a combination of beef tallow and gulping collagen every morning instead of the real culprit-great fillers.\n\nThis is not to say that Jaclyns are simply virtuous vanguards of wellness. They're also the most fun out of any trio and are likely the leaders who the other two orbit their plans around (even if they're not aware of it!).\n\nWhile the Kates will actually organize the activity, the Jaclyns determine if anyone will actually show up to the function. You're a free-spirited, fun-loving, but lowkey depressed Leo. Can afford The Row but tell everyone it's an Amazon dupe. Will giggle and agree with a French person that it's pronounced Jacqueline . Love to quote Joan Didion on Instagram. And see books as more of an aesthetic accompaniment then, I don't know, a thing to read!\n\nAre you a little bit too into Ballerina Farm? Appreciate the theory, tentative to employ the praxis? I'm afraid you might be the Kate of your group.\n\nThe Kates are the physical binding glue of this platonic ménage à trois, always the one to make the dinner reservation, never the ones who receive enough gratitude for camping out on Resy as much as they do. They're a little too proud to be drinking cow milk again-or, worse, raw milk-and, like the MAHA mom, will scream about seed oils being terrible for you but fearlessly try an untested lip filler just to see if it does a little something.\n\nLikely a Virgo at their best or a Gemini (respectfully) at their worst, the Kates are the type-A's who wear it as a cap of shame. They want to be the free-spirited Jaclyn, but no matter how many shots they down on a night out, they will be too busy thinking about how they're going to get everyone back home (a good thing, though, which we love you for!).\n\nThe most sinister of Kates, akin to Bibb's own portrayal on the show, think they're immune to the s***-talking because they're always the ones to start it-however-a rude awakening is in store.\n\nUncomfortable with the silence? Desperate to keep the group all smiles despite secretly telling friend #2 that friend #3 is wearing the ugliest effing skirt you've ever seen two minutes ago? Bonjour Kate, it's lovely to have you.\n\nTouch-starved. Capricorn. Never not telling everyone how much you need a vacation. These are but some of the qualities that signify if you are a Laurie in this life.\n\nThe friend that's constantly seesawing between focusing on their career or prioritizing their love life (good riddance to the thought of having both!), the Lauries are the ones whose Friday night will begin with a proud proclamation of singlehood and end with a doom-scroll of \"me and u\" memes on Twitter.\n\nYou're the friend that everyone keeps trying to get on Hinge-you protest-but little do they know you've already applied to get on Raya. And when you do eventually make your way onto that app, you will try to get with some microcelebrity DJ because the world needs to know that you ARE a #fun, #cool girl.\n\nThe friend who is plagued by constant comparison (you are good enough). The friend who will cry during a massage (the tension is all in your hips darling). And the friend who really thought Hillary was going to win (come on babes), the Lauries are to be intimately cared for because they really are not doing it enough for themselves...especially in that department.\n\nSo will these three women kill each other by the end of their week at the White Lotus? Or will they somehow become closer than ever? If any of the similar, real-life friendships are an indicator, they'll likely sweep everything under the rug and squeal: \"Oh my god we should totally do this again!\"\n\nNight News Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

The First Step Act, passed in the Senate earlier this week with an 87-12 vote, would roll back sentences for federal prisoners, including mandatory life terms for third-time offenders and mandatory sentences for nonviolent drug users. The bill is now heading to the desk of President Trump, who has pledged to sign it into law. The bill only affects federal prisoners, who make up less than 10 percent of the more than 2 million U.S. prisoners. It has been endorsed by a wide range of supporters across the political spectrum, from the American Civil Liberties Union to the conservative Koch brothers. But parts of the bill explicitly exclude immigrants, and it has been criticized by groups such as the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of more than 150 black-led organizations, for encouraging profiteering and making \"false promises\" about bringing black prisoners home. We speak with Van Jones, president and co-founder of #cut50, a national bipartisan initiative to reduce the U.S.'s incarcerated population by 50 percent over the next 10 years. We also speak with Jessica Jackson Sloan, a human rights attorney and co-founder and national director of #cut50.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I'm Amy Goodman, as we turn to look at a major criminal justice reform bill that may soon become law, after the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted in its favor Thursday. It's called the FIRST STEP Act. The bipartisan measure, which passed in the Senate earlier this week with an unheard-of 87-to-12 vote, would roll back sentences for federal prisoners, including mandatory life terms for third-time offenders, as well as mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug users and those convicted of firearm crimes. The bill is now heading to the desk of President Trump, who has pledged to sign it into law, perhaps today.\n\nThe bill only affects federal prisoners, who make up less than 10 percent of the more than 2 million U.S. prisoners. The U.S. has the largest prison population in the world. The FIRST STEP Act ends sentencing disparities for convictions of crack cocaine versus powder cocaine, a distinction that's long led to deep racial disparities in prison terms.\n\nThis is Democratic Senator Dick Durbin speaking shortly after the Senate vote.\n\nSEN . DICK DURBIN : Let me preface my remarks by telling you about the worst vote I ever cast as a member of Congress. You don't hear many senators stand up and say, \"Let me tell you about my worst vote.\" Well, I can tell you, it was in the House of Representatives. It was 1986. And because we were scared to death of crack cocaine, which was now showing up all over America, we created 100-to-1 disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine sentencing.\n\nThe net result of that, we thought, would be to scare America straight in terms of the danger of this drug. And it backfired. It turned out we had more drugs on the street. We had a lower price for the drugs that were out there, because of the burgeoning supply. And we started filling up our jails with people who were arrested for drug offenses, a 700 percent increase in our jail population, because of this new level of our war on drugs. I voted for it. A lot of Democrats did. ...\n\nWe're not finished. It's entitled the FIRST STEP . What's the second step? The second step is to learn from this experience and to find a way to reduce incarceration while still reducing the crime rate in America.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The bill has been endorsed by a wide range of supporters across the political spectrum, from the American Civil Liberties Union to the conservative Koch brothers. It's also a major priority of senior White House adviser, presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner, whose father spent time in a federal prison for tax evasion and other charges.\n\nFor more, we go to Washington, D.C., where we're joined by Van Jones, president and co-founder of #cut50, a national bipartisan initiative to reduce the U.S. incarcerated population by half over the next 10 years. Van Jones was President Barack Obama's green jobs adviser in 2009, founded Green for All, also a CNN political commentator. And also with us, Jessica Jackson Sloan, human rights attorney, co-founder and national director of #cut50.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Van, let's begin with you. How did this happen? Do you think it will be signed today? What is most significant? What are you most proud of with this prison reform bill?\n\nVAN JONES : I believe it will be signed today.\n\nHere's what happened. Formerly incarcerated people, directly impacted family members said, \"We are not going to let the Trump administration go on criminal justice reform the way they went on immigration and on guns and on climate and every other issue, and poison the well. We are going to insist that the momentum that was developed under President Obama carry forward.\" And those groups, mainly led by #cut50, found an ally in Jared Kushner, whose, again, father went to prison and who wanted to make a difference.\n\nAnd it was the most remarkable thing to see Trump, who came into office talking about law and order and embracing the Blue Lives Matter movement and talking about American carnage and putting Jeff Sessions in place-really moving in a very negative direction-over the past year begin to turn. Kim Kardashian went in there and got him to release Ms. Alice Johnson. He began to add to his speeches some of the things he was hearing from formerly incarcerated people and from Jared.\n\nAnd we ultimately were able to build, I think, the biggest bipartisan movement in the country, and got 87 senators to vote with us earlier this week. You can't get 87 senators to vote together to change the name of a post office anymore. But on this issue, we finally had a breakthrough.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, I want to go to the woman you just referred to, Alice Marie Johnson. Earlier this year, President Trump commuted her life sentence-she was imprisoned for a first-time, nonviolent drug offense-after her cause was taken up by the reality television star Kim Kardashian West. Alice Marie Johnson, 63-year-old grandmother from Memphis, released Wednesday from federal prison-released a while ago from federal prison in Aliceville, Alabama, where she had been serving her sentence for nearly 22 years. This is Johnson speaking after her release.\n\nALICE MARIE JOHNSON : When the criteria came out for clemency, I thought for sure-in fact, I was certain-that I had met and exceeded all of the criteria. I had 100 percent clear conduct for the entire time, my entire time in prison, no disciplinary infractions. I am a true first-time, nonviolent offender. And even the prison staff wrote letters about my accomplishments in prison. I had letters from members of Congress, the outside public. Oh, my goodness, I had so much support. ... I was denied again, with no explanation given. So it leaves me wondering what more I could have done.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Alice Marie Johnson speaking while she was still jailed. But she is free. Earlier this year, Kim Kardashian West spoke to Mic about her meeting with Donald Trump on behalf of Alice Marie Johnson.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN WEST : I went in, me and Shawn, to really talk to the president about Alice Johnson and really explain to him why she would be such a good person to grant clemency to. I just feel really strongly that she has such a good support system. She has a job waiting for her. She has a home to go to. And she has such a great, supportive family, that just even seeing the work that she's done while she's in prison, knowing that she would never get out? ... You know, she's done her time. I mean, she's done almost 22 years. You know, I think, in life, everyone makes mistakes, and she really deserves a second chance.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, yes, that's Kim Kardashian. She met with the president, and Alice Marie Johnson was freed a few months ago. Jessica Jackson Sloan, talk about the significance of this moment and then how you overcame the opposition of so many Republicans, like Tom Cotton, for example, from Arkansas and others. I mean, 87 to 12.\n\nJESSICA JACKSON SLOAN : Yeah. Yeah, no, this is a historic moment. This is a moment where you not only have Republicans and Democrats coming together, you've got people from all across the country. Like Van said, the formerly incarcerated leaders, who said, \"Enough is enough. We're not going to tell our people inside that they've got to wait another four years before they can get any kind of relief. We're going to keep fighting.\" They stepped up. They organized in their states. You've got media from all over the country, everything from the Lexington Courier to The New York Times , saying this is one of the most significant criminal justice reforms and that Trump needed to get this done and Congress needed to get this done. You've got the National Association of Manufacturers. You've got Verizon. You've got the U.S. Chambers Association.\n\nVAN JONES : Fox News.\n\nJESSICA JACKSON SLOAN : Fox News broadcasting-all coming together, saying, you know, \"We've got to get this done.\" So I think, while this is an epic reform for all the reasons you laid out in the beginning, I also think this is a huge moment in the narrative around criminal justice reform. For decades, we've been hearing this Willie Horton narrative: \"Don't let people out, or they're going to end up reoffending, and there's going to be victims, and you'll never be elected again.\" Ms. Alice and this FIRST STEP Act are the antidote to the Willie Horton narrative. This is a turning point for the entire movement in the entire country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, if you could tell us, Jessica, your own story, how you got involved, your own husband in prison?\n\nJESSICA JACKSON SLOAN : Yes. When I was 22 years old, I had nothing but a GED and a 2-month-old daughter. I found myself standing in a courtroom in Georgia watching as my husband got sentenced to 15, serve six. This was-in my mind at the time, I thought it was a fluke. I knew he was a great dad. I knew he was a great husband. I knew he was a boss to 17 people, and he showed up for work every morning on time. I knew what a great guy he was. And to watch the system just take all that away, and watch us go into financial ruin and my daughter grow up without her dad there, just because he had a drug addiction, and then watch, you know, as he stayed through the system not getting any help, that's what motivated me to get involved. And I think those personal experiences are what have motivated everybody, from Jared Kushner to Shon Hopwood to many of these advocates, who have been out there fighting for this bill and saying it's time to get some relief.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Van, if you could talk about-well, I mean, some might say perhaps this was passed by many Republicans because so many Republicans are facing prison right now, around the administration and others. Michelle Goldberg has a very interesting \"op-ed piece\": in The New York Times , the headline \"Donald Trump Is Doing Something ... Good? Conservatives get serious about criminal justice reform.\" But she lays out the number of conservative political actors, not meaning Hollywood actors, but who did go to prison, I mean, people like Chuck Colson, of Watergate fame, who goes to prison and gets deeply involved with the prison reform movement, right through, right now, to Kevin Ring, president of the criminal justice reform organization Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a former Republican Hill staff member who once helped draft a law imposing mandatory minimums for meth dealers.\n\nVAN JONES : Yeah. Well, I mean, the actual thing that's happening, the incarceration industry has gotten so big, mass incarceration has gotten so massive, that now Republicans, Democrats, white folks, black folks, brown folks, poor folks, even some rich folks sometimes, wind up getting pulled in. And when you get pulled in or a family member gets pulled in or a neighbor gets pulled in or a co-worker gets pulled in, you realize we have unleashed a horror on this country. And you cannot get out of it. You've got to do something about it. And so, you do have people who are directly impacted, on both sides of the aisle now, who fought until the last dog barked, who backed McConnell down, who beat the dog crap out of Tom Cotton and won this thing, because people-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Cotton remains opposed.\n\nVAN JONES : Yeah, well, Tom remains opposed. He got 11 votes, or, I mean, he got destroyed, because that old law-and-order, scare-everybody crap, he tried to pull that stuff, and Republicans voted him down. And so, you're in a situation now where there is-a change has begun to happen. And, you know, this idea that Trump is just doing this because he's going to go to jail, whatever, look, Trump could just pardon all his family members right now and be done with it and just walk off. I think that something has happened in-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Not for the New York investigations.\n\nVAN JONES : Well, I'm just saying that for most of these-I think the cynicism-and, Amy, I've got to speak to this. The level of cynicism and pain and frustration that has now built up on the left because of this nightmare in the White House should not rob us of a victory that we have fought for now for 25 years, long before any of these people were in office, people like me and people who are listening to this radio station and have been fighting at the local level. And we have finally come to a point where even the Republican Party agrees with us. And I don't want any of your listeners to say, \"Well, I'm not going to believe something good is happening.\" No, when we fight and we don't give up, good things can happen, even under the Trump administration. Let's not take-let's not let the cynicism take that away.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And let me ask you about Jared Kushner, this all happening-something he is very much pushing and getting credit for-in this period of time, these months, when he's been an adviser to the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, how to get out of these accusations that he was responsible for murdering the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Your thoughts on this? You even got to-you work with him all the time, but you even got to interview him on this subject.\n\nVAN JONES : Yeah, sure. Listen, I disagree with the Trump administration on many things. I always say, I've got 99 conflicts with the Trump administration, but prisons ain't one. And so, I'm not here to try to litigate everything that they've done.\n\nBut what I can say about Jared Kushner is, on this issue, he has been relentless. He's been dogged. Everything he said he would do, he has done, which I can't say about most of the Democrats involved, frankly, or most of the Republicans. And so, on this issue, I can say to you and to anybody else-and, Amy, as you know, I'm a founder of the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights. We helped to close five abusive youth prisons in California, stop a super-jail. I'm not a newcomer to this issue. Before I was ever on CNN , I was fighting on this issue. And I can say that Jared Kushner, on this issue, has been as dogged and determined as any other impacted family member in this movement.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So let's talk about some of the progressive groups, like the Movement for Black Lives. The coalition of more than 150 black-led organizations has come out against the FIRST STEP Act. They wrote a statement, quote, \"This bill is custom-made for rich white men. All of the carve outs make the vast majority of our people ineligible for the benefits of the bill. Moreover, by mandating post release surveillance the bill opens the door to increased privatization while causing additional harm to the most marginalized of our people. We believe all of this will be done while giving liberal cover to the Trump Administration as they attack, cage, and warehouse Black, brown, and working class people across the country.\" The Movement for Black Lives also points out the bill explicitly excludes immigrants from access to early release and rehab programs and will direct money, say, from early releases to go back into law enforcement. They say the bill encourages profiteering and makes false promises about bringing black prisoners home. Your thoughts, Van?\n\nVAN JONES : Well, I'll say they should have told the Congressional Black Caucus that, because the vast majority of black lawmakers voted for it. And some of those things are not accurate. Let me say this-Jessica is smarter on the policy. Let me just say this: It's called the FIRST STEP Act. It's not the LAST STEP Act; it's the FIRST STEP Act. This bill does not do any harm to anyone. The goodness in the bill doesn't get to as many people. There's good programs in there that don't-everybody can't participate in. The goodness in the bill doesn't get to as many people as we want to, but there is not one additional piece of harm. Not one sentence gets any longer. Nobody serves an extra day. And that, by itself, is something of a victory. And I'll say more after Jessica.\n\nJESSICA JACKSON SLOAN : So, I just wanted to jump in and correct some of that misinformation, because I just don't want to have viewers listening and thinking that that is true. And it's just not.\n\nI've seen the numbers. The U.S. Sentencing Commission actually did an analysis, and the exclusions actually are pretty much across the board for white, black and Hispanic individuals. Those exclusions are for a small part of the bill: the time credits that people can earn by doing programming. There are plenty of pieces of the bill that do apply to everybody who's inside of the prison, regardless of what crime they committed, including the increased good time credit that people can earn off of their sentence for good behavior.\n\nI also want to point to the crack cocaine retroactivity. That disproportionately is going to impact African Americans who are inside. There are going to be a lot more African Americans coming home in this first batch of individuals who are coming home than any other race, and that is because people fought very, very hard-Dick Durbin, in particular-to make sure that nothing went forward that didn't include a massive fix of retroactivity on the Fair Sentencing Act, which had been passed almost a decade ago.\n\nSo, I just want to correct some of that misinformation on the immigrants piece also. You know, I'm sorry we couldn't get away with getting rid of the current ban on people who are here undocumented going to halfway houses. We tried. We pushed. We were unable to get away from it. But it is just a continuation of the status quo . So, I just wanted to address those couple points, and invite people to look at FirstStepAct.org , if they want to check out all the wonderful things that are in this bill.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And how you extend this beyond federal prisoners? This deals with 10 percent, right? Two hundred thousand prisoners in federal prison. What about now the model being for all prisoners? What's your next step, Jessica?\n\nJESSICA JACKSON SLOAN : Well, you know, we're already getting calls from state legislators across the country asking us, \"Can we do this in my state? What can we do in my state?\" And not just Democratic state legislators. Both sides of the aisle now feel comfortable. They're seeing there was a clear mandate by Congress: 87 to 12, 358 to 35. I mean, just a mandate. And every single one of the amendments meant to be poison pills, slapped down. So, they're wanting to get going in their own states. This really has made an impact on the narrative. And I think we're going to see a lot of trickle-down justice coming from this bill.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to thank you both for being with us.\n\nVAN JONES : Could I just add?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Van, you wanted to say something?

This actually may take off the table criminal justice as a weapon against Democrats in 2020, for the first time since 1988 with Willie Horton. You now have-because Republicans are embracing, for whatever reason, Trump embracing, for whatever reason, now it's a lot harder to say that progressives and Democrats are going to make it less safe, when literally you have both parties on one accord. So, politically, this is very, very smart for Democrats and progressives. We are now more safe than ever to keep pushing for progress.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to thank you both for being with us, Jessica Jackson Sloan, co-founder and national director of #cut50; Van Jones, president and co-founder of #cut50, also commentator on CNN .\n\nThis is Democracy Now!

The driver was 16-year-old Ethan Couch. He was speeding, with a blood-alcohol level more than three times the legal limit. Couch has admitted to his crime, and in a case that went before a Texas judge, prosecutors sought a 20-year sentence. Instead, Couch was sentenced to 10 years' probation after a psychologist claimed he had \"affluenza,\" and testified that his cushy upbringing prevented him from connecting bad behavior with its consequences. We get response from Richard Alpert, the Tarrant County assistant district attorney who prosecuted the case against Couch. We are also joined by Boyce Watkins, a Syracuse University professor and the founder of \"YourBlackWorld.net.\" He recently wrote an article titled \"Rich, White Kids Have 'Affluenza,' Poor, Black Kids Go to Prison.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\n911 DISPATCHER : And how many people need EMS ?\n\nCALLER : Ma'am, I'm telling you, it's dark. There's four or five kids. There's kids laying in ditches and street.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: That was a 911 call from last June, when four people were killed by a drunk driver. The driver was 16-year-old Ethan Couch. He was speeding, with a blood-alcohol level more than three times the legal limit. Couch has admitted to his crime, and in a case that went before a Texas judge, prosecutors sought a 20-year sentence. Instead, he was sentenced to 10 years' probation after a psychologist claimed he suffered from \"affluenza,\" which he described as growing up in a house where the parents were preoccupied with arguments that led to a divorce. On Wednesday, a judge ordered him to go to an expensive rehabilitation facility paid for by his parents. This is CNN's Anderson Cooper questioning the psychologist.\n\nANDERSON COOPER : A 14-year-old African-American child was sentenced by this same judge a year or two ago. This 14-year-old killed one person, punching him. That person fell and hit his head on the sidewalk and died. That African-American child got 10-year sentence, got sent to the juvenile justice facility. I mean, why should there be a separate system-\n\nDICK MILLER : Well-\n\nANDERSON COOPER : -just because you have money?\n\nDICK MILLER : I don't think there is a separate system. This young man will be a ward of the state for 10 years, Anderson. Ten years-\n\nANDERSON COOPER : He's on probation.\n\nDICK MILLER : -that if he missteps any time, that judge can send him to the penitentiary.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: That was on Anderson Cooper's-on CNN . Couch will reportedly be attending a rehab facility that costs $450,000 a year. Marla Mitchell, whose daughter Breanna was killed in the accident, spoke to reporters shortly after the ruling.\n\nMARLA MITCHELL : No matter what game he or his family think they've beaten, the world is not ever going to take their eyes off from him. And they're going to be waiting. They're going to be waiting for him to mess up again, if he does.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, for more, we're joined by two guests. In Dallas, Texas, we're joined by Richard Alpert, who prosecuted the case against Ethan Couch. He's the Tarrant County assistant district attorney. In Chicago, we're joined by Boyce Watkins, a Syracuse University professor, founder of YourBlackWorld.net , recently wrote a piece headlined \"Rich, White Kids Have 'Affluenza,' Poor, Black Kids Go to Prison.\"\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Let's go to the prosecutor in the case, Richard Alpert. Can you lay out what happened in Wednesday's hearing? How is it that affluenza is used to get Ethan Couch off? He killed not only four people, but critically injured others.\n\nRICHARD ALPERT : Well, the Wednesday hearing was just a conclusion of the proceedings that started six weeks ago. The affluenza came out of the mouth of Dr. Miller, who was on the Anderson Cooper clip you just played. And basically, because-the defense position was, because he had this profoundly dysfunctional family, because they-he was a child of privilege, because his parents let him do what he wanted to do, that somehow he wasn't responsible. It was the parents' fault, not his fault, that this crime occurred. And it's a contention that we found to be just ludicrous. It's a contention that we confronted in the courtroom. We thought we did so effectively. And, you know, the judge obviously didn't give the sentence we wanted to be given. We thought that pen time was appropriate for this young man.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And has this kind of defense been used previously?\n\nRICHARD ALPERT : I've never heard of anyone claiming that the fact that a person has privilege or the person comes from money is something that entitles them to different consequences. I've never heard that before. Again, I mean, the phrase that was thrown out there, from what I've seen after the fact, it doesn't even apply to this situation. It was never meant as a defense. And it just wasn't credible. So, I think it's a one-shot kind of situation. I don't think that anyone is going to attempt to do this. And again, since the judge made the determination, we don't know what factor she considered.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I was watching Alex Molina-Alex Lemus being interviewed. His younger brother, 16-year-old Sergio Molina, was in the car, as was Alex, with Ethan Couch, begging him to slow down. Sergio Molina is in-is minimally responsive now, and it has been a long time. He can hardly move. He doesn't respond. This is-this is Alex Lemus talking about his brother.\n\nALEX LEMUS : They told us that basically that's as much as he's going to rehabilitate, that that's-that's all we can hope for, is how he is right now, for the rest of his life.\n\nGARY TUCHMAN : His brother says he has quit his job to stay with Sergio all the time.\n\nALEX LEMUS : That's my life. If I have to become a scientist to go up in there and fix him, that's what I'm-that's my life, man. That's how much I love him.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's Alex Lemus describing his brother's condition right now. Alex went on to say, actually-he said not only does a rich white person get off, but they invent words that then people have to say, like \"affluenza.\" Boyce Watkins, can you respond to this? You wrote a piece called \"Rich, White Kids Have 'Affluenza,' Poor, Black Kids Go to Prison.\"\n\nBOYCE WATKINS : You know, I can say that starting life as a poor black kid myself, you know, I find it actually quite interesting that his wealth can be a source of privilege and opportunity and an asset for him all throughout his life, but then, suddenly, that asset is contorted into a liability, which ultimately makes it into another asset. You know, I know guys who have gotten 40 years in prison for possession of one gram of crack cocaine. I had an older brother who went to prison at an early age, and it led him down a spiral of mental illness that stayed with him until he died.\n\nI was personally offended by what this judge did. And I really think that this judge-particularly since this sentence was so inconsistent with previous sentences, particularly with African-American defendants, I think the judge should be investigated for corruption. I wouldn't be surprised if there was some sort of link, financially or otherwise, or politically, that led to this outcome. I think everyone should be outraged, not just African Americans, but pretty much all of us, which I think is the case.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Boyce, Boyce Watkins, in terms of this becoming some kind of a precedent, in a new age here of a tale of two countries, really, that we have between rich and poor in America?\n\nBOYCE WATKINS : Well, we already have a tale of two countries. I mean, America has really become addicted to capitalism, extreme capitalism. I'm a finance professor, and so I don't hate capitalism, but at the same time, I know that capitalism is powerful, like fire or drug, which can either cook your food and keep you warm or burn you and your family alive. And ultimately in America, you see that the gap between the rich and the poor is growing more and more every year, and it's really affecting our political and judicial systems.\n\nAlso, we have two tales here when it comes to race. The United Nations has repeatedly cited the United States for having a two-tier society when it comes to the educational system, the economic system and the criminal justice system. Everyone kind of knows about the joke except for us.\n\nAnd so, when you talk about a kid like Ethan Couch, I'd say that the best cure for his affluenza would be prison. And I think most people know that. And I think we have to understand that this judge is just one judge who made a bad decision, but at the same time, it could be something that could be applied all across the country, because most studies show that disparate sentencing does exist between races and between people with different socioeconomic statuses.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're going to have to leave it there. I want to thank you both for being with us. Boyce Watkins, a Syracuse University professor, founded YourBlackWorld.net , wrote \"Rich, White Kids Have 'Affluenza,' Poor, Black Kids Go to Prison.\" Thank you so much to Richard Alpert, Tarrant County assistant district attorney, one of the prosecutors in the affluenza case.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nIn a web exclusive conversation, we speak with prison abolitionist Mariame Kaba about Cyntoia Brown being granted full clemency by Republican Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam after serving 15 years in prison, the failures of the criminal justice reform bill known as the First Step Act, and the fight against NYC jail expansion as Mayor Bill de Blasio proposes building four new jails. Kaba is an organizer and educator who has worked on anti-domestic violence programs, anti-incarceration and racial justice programs since the late 1980s. Kaba is the co-founder of Survived and Punished, an organization that supports survivors of violence who have been criminalized for defending themselves. She's also a board member of Critical Resistance.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Part 2 of our discussion about the clemency granted to Cyntoia Brown.\n\nRepublican Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam granted full clemency to Cyntoia Brown Monday, after she had served 15 years in prison. The decision follows months of intense pressure and outrage over her case.\n\nBrown was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of first-degree murder for shooting her rapist as a teenager. She was sexually trafficked, repeatedly abused and drugged. The shooting happened when Brown was just 16 years old, but she was tried as an adult. Brown is now 30 years old. She's set to be released in August.\n\nWe continue our conversation with Mariame Kaba, organizer and educator who has worked on anti-domestic violence programs, as well as anti-incarceration and racial justice programs, since the late '80s. She's the co-founder of Survived and Punished, a group that supports survivors of violence that have been criminalized for defending themselves. She's a board member of Critical Resistance.\n\nThank you so much for staying for Part 2 of this discussion. We talked all about what happened to Cyntoia Brown. But now, with this clemency-\n\nMARIAME KABA : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -granted by the Republican Tennessee governor, that comes out of, not even months, years of organizing-\n\nMARIAME KABA : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What does full clemency mean?\n\nMARIAME KABA : Well, full clemency means, in this case, that he offered to commute her sentence to time served. So, that means that while she had a life sentence and the court upheld, in December, that she would have to spend 51 years in prison, the governor basically said the 15 years that you spent in prison is enough, and released her to supervised parole. And so, that's what's going to happen.\n\nWhat he didn't do was offer her a pardon, which would have expunged her record. And that's important, because expunging her record will allow her to have more ability to be able to make a life for herself. As you know, having a conviction on your record really has an impact negatively on your ability to be able to find a job, for example, after you are released. It has a negative impact on you being able to actually vote. So she's now disenfranchised. She won't be able to vote in Tennessee or anywhere in the country again, based on her felony conviction.\n\nI also want to point out something about the collateral consequences of the psychological stuff that she's going to have to deal with. Being incarcerated in a prison-prisons are hellholes. She is now going to have to be out into the world. But she spent her formative years locked up behind bars, from the time that she was 16 years old to now, being 31, when she gets out. That's huge. I mean, I want people to think about what you were doing at 16, and if you were like literally taken outside of the world during that time and then plopped back into the world now today, what your adjustment would be like. I think we have to be mindful of that and think about that, not just for Cyntoia, but for so many people who have served long sentences in prison.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You've spoken about her not being able to vote-\n\nMARIAME KABA : That's right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -for the rest of her life.\n\nMARIAME KABA : That's right. She's disenfranchised. Right?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Interesting, if she lived in Florida, well, that would still be the case. But now it looks like, unless the governor, DeSantis, succeeds in stopping this-\n\nMARIAME KABA : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -it is possible that well over a million Floridians will be able to vote-\n\nMARIAME KABA : That's right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -who served time, perhaps in jail-\n\nMARIAME KABA : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -or have felonies-\n\nMARIAME KABA : That's right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -that don't include murder or sexual assault.\n\nMARIAME KABA : I think, you know, one of the people who was one of the leaders of that effort, Desmond [Meade], said something that I thought was really profound, at an event that I was at last year, where he said, \"Imagine if all of the people who have been disenfranchised because they were incarcerated were re-enfranchised. We'd be talking about a whole different electorate.\" We'd be talking basically about a third party-you know?-of people who would shift and shake up everything that we know currently in the two-party system. I think that is so profound, and so-and why so many people want to push back against it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean, it's so interesting. As we know, the famous George Bush case, he won by like 500 votes.\n\nMARIAME KABA : That's right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And then you have Donald Trump by 110,000 votes.\n\nMARIAME KABA : That's right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're talking about well over a million people.\n\nMARIAME KABA : Exactly, 1.4, yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And they might not have even served time in prison.\n\nMARIAME KABA : That's right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : If they have a felony on their record-\n\nMARIAME KABA : That's right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -they can now go register to vote.\n\nMARIAME KABA : Yeah, that's huge.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, in the first part of this discussion,  I asked you how many other Cyntoia Browns are there in prison.\n\nMARIAME KABA : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You've spent your life organizing for women who have been imprisoned. You're a survivor yourself.\n\nMARIAME KABA : I am.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about the women you have fought for their freedom.\n\nMARIAME KABA : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And as you said, you're not surprised, because you believe organizing leads to success\n\nMARIAME KABA : That's right. I believe we can-I think the only way we can't win is if we don't organize. So, I think if you're going to-you know, it's worth fighting, it's worth being in the struggle.\n\nI have been involved, on and off, for most of my adult life in campaigns to help support criminalized survivors, in multiple kinds of ways. And people might know a few of the names of people that I've been involved in the campaigns for freedom for. One is a woman named Marissa Alexander, who people may know. And I think Marissa has been on this show, which makes me so happy to be able to see her out free now, in a way that-you know, she was a domestic violence survivor in Florida who shot a warning shot to defend herself against her abusive husband, who she had-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Into the garage roof.\n\nMARIAME KABA : That's right, into like-just in, actually, her-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ceiling.\n\nMARIAME KABA : -ceiling of her house, that she was just in to get some materials from, and he came and confronted her. Right? She just had a baby nine days earlier. So, you know, and then they basically arrested her. And then she was tried, 12-minute jury deliberation, and she ended up with a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence, for firing a warning shot to defend herself. And so-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And this all came out right around the time-\n\nMARIAME KABA : When George Zimmerman's case was in the news, when George Zimmerman was threatening to use Stand Your Ground. And people were like, \"Wait a minute. There's this black woman in, you know, Duval County in Florida, Marissa Alexander, who in 2010 was actually incarcerated-was convicted, a 20-year mandatory minimum.\"\n\nAnd the judge in that case said to her that she couldn't invoke Stand Your Ground because she didn't appear afraid. Right? This goes back to what we were talking about before, which is: Can black women ever be victims? Are we always going to have to be the aggressors? Are we never possible to actually be harmed, never able to be fearful for our lives? Right? Like, we actually have, constitutionally, an inability for people to see us as people who actually are vulnerable to violence, which we are, at a disproportionate rate within our communities and by the state.\n\nAnd so, I really thought about that a lot when we were on Marissa's case and were doing a lot of organizing. I co-founded the Chicago Alliance to Free Marissa Alexander, which is now called Love & Protect, which still exists in Illinois, and they're still running campaigns to free more survivors and do clemency campaigns, etc. So, that was just one example of one of the people that I was involved in helping to support.\n\nBresha Meadows was another young woman recently that Survived and Punished helped to make sure she didn't end up spending life, when she killed her abusive father when she was only 14 years old. And this is a case that was going on in Ohio. Bresha is now home with her family. Right? And they were threatening to put her in prison for the rest of her life, as a 14-year-old, who had a credible situation with her father having abused her mother for her entire life, and also some allegations of sexual abuse of Bresha herself.\n\nSo, these are the cases that people have heard of because of organizing. But there are so many other people who are currently locked up whose stories are not being told. Here in New York, we have just launched a campaign called Free Them New York. People can go to FreeThemNY.com and see the stories of a bunch of survivors that are currently incarcerated in New York state prisons, that we're pushing Governor Cuomo to commute their sentences. So, it's an ongoing thing.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you tell us about the case of Chrystul Kizer?\n\nMARIAME KABA : Chrystul Kizer, my understanding is that her case-she's in Milwaukee. She killed somebody who had coerced her into child pornography. She killed him when she was 17 years old. And there's a campaign currently ongoing to try to get the prosecutors to drop the charges against her.\n\nHere in New York, by the way, we have a case of a woman named Nikki Addimando, a mother of two, who, after 10 years of brutal abuse by her partner, ended up shooting her partner in self-defense. She's in Poughkeepsie, New York. And the horrible prosecutor over there is-got charges against her on first-degree murder, and she is potentially facing life in prison. They say that her trial will begin at the end of this month. It's probably not going to begin at-you know, they keep saying that, and then they'll keep pushing it back, and God knows when they'll actually put her on trial. But we are pushing right now, through Survived and Punished New York, to get her case to be dismissed. She has documented proof of the abuse she suffered, including photographs, including all sorts of testimony from people in the community. And her name is Nikki Addimando, and her hashtag is #FreeNikki. So, there's just constant examples of what is going on around this and around the country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : One of the people you worked on with Survived and Punished was an immigrant woman.\n\nMARIAME KABA : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about her.\n\nMARIAME KABA : I didn't actually work on this. The campaign was called Stand with Nan-Hui. Stand with Nan-Hui's campaign was-is part of Survived and Punished. But it was a California group of folks that came together to fight for her. She was-she still is-an immigrant, who was married to an American, who had a child. She was a victim of domestic violence, severe. She took her child overseas to get away from her abuser. When she returned to the country, they arrested her, took her child away and put her in immigrant detention. And this group, this legal defense campaign called Stand with Nan-Hui, that then became part of Survived and-co-founding Survived and Punished, was able to fight for her freedom successfully. And she's out of immigrant detention, and she continues to be able to see her daughter, etc., etc.\n\nSo it just points to the importance of legal defense campaigns. It points to the importance of participatory defense campaigns. And I think people should be-a reminder to folks that we have to keep fighting for people when they are criminalized, that, you know, what happens is that if you don't have support, you end up going behind, you know, closed doors, basically, of the court system, and they railroad you, on a regular basis, because they're trying to get everybody to plead out, right?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about the media's role, Mariame Kaba, when it comes to, for example, Cyntoia Brown? How did the media cover her case?\n\nMARIAME KABA : Well, I think the media covered her case according to how the state presented it, which was of a cold-blooded murderer who ended up killing this man, they said, in his sleep, which was not true at all, and that she was there to rob him on behalf of her pimp, Kutthroat, and that she was presented in an unsympathetic light.\n\nI think the thing that shifted was that documentary that was put out in 2010 called Me Facing Life , because, you know, that's a full six years after the incident, and those documentary filmmakers really humanized her, told her story, showed the context of the abuse that she had suffered prior to getting to the point where she had run away from home. Right? And so, that was a use of media that was actually useful. It was a humanizing effect of media rather than a sensationalist effect of media.\n\nAnd that's actually how I learned about Cyntoia's case in 2010. I started blogging about it because somebody sent me a preview copy of that documentary, which I watched, which then made me get interested in the case. And I organized a screening in early 2011 in Chicago of Me Facing Life , along with Community Cinema in Chicago. And we brought a whole bunch of people together for a panel, which I moderated, to talk about Cyntoia's case along with the cases of other criminalized survivors. So that was back in 2011, just, again, to show you the long arc of how long people have been talking about her case and trying to focus on getting her free.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Mariame Kaba, what is the Me Too movement missing when it comes to women of color?\n\nMARIAME KABA : Well, I think that question is really interesting to me, because Me Too was started by a woman of color. Right? So-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Tarana Burke.\n\nMARIAME KABA : You know, Tarana Burke.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Who's been on this show a number of times.\n\nMARIAME KABA : Tarana is amazing. I mean, Tarana is a longtime organizer and activist, who's been doing this work basically without any attention for a couple of decades, right? She is at-she's part of an organization called Girls for Gender Equity, run-you know, organized by an amazing powerhouse black woman named Joanne Smith. And they were doing this work, silently.\n\nAnd it was when Alyssa Milano created the hashtag #MeToo that that blew up. And it blew up because it was a white woman who was famous and celebrity, that then people could feel like they could rally around. So, that's  a-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Even though she attributed it to Tarana.\n\nMARIAME KABA : Oh, she-no, right away, she was able-because people came up and said-it wasn't just that she attributed it to her. She didn't know. She just kind of created this thing, but she didn't know it was a pre-existing thing. Right? And so, what happened is that people got to her and said, \"You know, this is a Me Too movement thing that's been started since 2006. And so, you know, like, you're on the bandwagon of something that already existed.\" And to her credit, she stepped up right away and said, like, \"Look at this work that came before I made this hashtag.\"\n\nSo, it is a movement for women of color. It isn't actually a movement that was started by white women. And so I find that to be really interesting in the way people are reframing it.\n\nI think, to me, Me Too has to come to the carceral state, which is, there are people currently locked up in prisons who are being sexually assaulted on a daily basis, mostly by the staff of those particular prisons. You know the numbers of lawsuits that are being filed on a daily basis against prison staff who are sexually violating people behind bars. That's also worthy of our attention. And I think I was here last time talking about-I don't remember if it was Bresha's case or something else, and I mentioned that criminalization itself is sexual violence. I want people to really understand that. The number of times, when you go-if anybody's ever been to a prison or jail, when you go in to visit people, the patdowns that you get, to just go in, is a sexual violation. You're the visitor. Imagine what happens to people on the inside-right?-behind those walls. So, I think Me Too has to think about that.\n\nI also think I worry that we're going to go the way of carceral feminisms, which is that we think we're going to end violence by using more violence, and, really, prisons are violence. You know, I've got my little thing here called \"Prison is not feminist,\" because it isn't actually a feminist-you know?-a feminist intervention. Prisons are violence. And so we have to think about other ways to try to address harm.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to turn to the case of R. Kelly. CNN reports police have issued an arrest warrant for James Mason, the former manager for the pop star R. Kelly-Mason accused of threatening to kill the father of Joycelyn Savage, who alleges R. Kelly is holding his daughter against her will in an abusive cult. A police report obtained by CNN quotes Mason as threatening Savage in a text message that read, \"I'm gonna do harm to you and your family, when I see you I'm gonna get you, I'm going to f-ing kill you.\" R. Kelly has been accused of sexual assault, predatory behavior and pedophilia for two decades but has never been criminally convicted. Now, in Chicago, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx says her office is investigating numerous complaints against R. Kelly and has encouraged other victims to step forward.\n\nMeanwhile, pop star Lady Gaga has apologized for collaborating with R. Kelly on the 2013 single \"Do What U Want (With My Body).\" Lady Gaga, herself a survivor of sexual assault, says she'll remove the single from streaming services like Spotify.\n\nThese developments are all coming days after the airing of a shocking six-part Lifetime documentary series, Surviving R. Kelly . I just want to play the film's trailer.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED : There's a difference between R. Kelly and Robert. R. Kelly is this fun, laughing, loving guy. But Robert is the devil.\n\nREPORTER 1: R. Kelly is at the top of the charts, but he may be in for a fall. He was arrested today on 21 counts of child pornography.\n\nREPORTER 2: Kelly is accused of videotaping himself having sex with an underage girl.\n\nRICHARD DEVINE : Taking advantage of minors will not be tolerated.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED : Jurors found him not guilty on all charges.\n\nALLAN MAYER : Robert has said all along ... he would be cleared of these terrible charges.\n\nPROTESTERS : Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you! Shame on you! Mute R. Kelly! Mute R. Kelly! Mute R. Kelly! Mute R. Kelly!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This film, Surviving R. Kelly , produced by dream hampton. You watched this?\n\nMARIAME KABA : I did watch. I did watch. I watched all six episodes, and it was very, very difficult to watch. It's difficult to watch, whether you're a survivor of sexual assault or not. But particularly if you are a survivor, I think a lot of people have felt very triggered by this film, this documentary series.\n\nBut I think it was an important cultural artifact and a cultural gift, basically, to everybody, to put these harms out in the light of day, make people who don't know the 20 years of R. Kelly's predation, didn't know about it, for them to-like, a new audience, a new younger group of folks, to understand really what he's about and what he's done. And so, I think-I think it was such an important series.\n\nAnd I know dream has suffered a lot of threats as a result of doing this work and that it was really difficult work to do. But as a filmmaker and a media maker, I have a lot of respect for her. And as a longtime organizer, she's been doing this work around anti-violence work for decades. So, it's just one more offering that she's put out there in the world for us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In 2018, Time's Up joined the call to #MuteRKelly. In response, a representative for R. Kelly said in a statement, \"R. Kelly's music is a part of American and African-American culture that should never-and will never-be silenced. Since America was born, black men and women have been lynched for having sex or for being accused of it. We will vigorously resist this attempted public lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture.\" Mariame Kaba, could you respond to this?\n\nMARIAME KABA : I mean, what is there to respond to? It is just gross. Right? It is disgusting that he would use the very real legacy of lynching black people, based on lies, that he would use that to defend himself, when it is clear that he has done all these things, right? It is-no one is falsely accusing him. He has multiple accusers, over many, many years, over a period of time. I find it offensive.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And we're talking about black women and girls.\n\nMARIAME KABA : Yeah, I mean, but that's the point. I think he counts-he's counting on the fact that no one will care because it's black women and black girls. He's counting on the fact that black men will not basically defend us. He is actually counting on that. So I think it's actually incumbent on black men right now to be holding each other to account and for them to step up in defense of black women, for them to step up in defense of black gender-nonconforming people, for people who are on the margins. Right? We deserve protection. We deserve protection.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Mariame Kaba, I want to ask you about the FIRST STEP Act, the criminal justice act just signed by President Trump, the law rolling back sentences for federal prisoners, including mandatory life terms for third-time offenders and mandatory sentences for nonviolent drug users. In December, I spoke to the co-founders of #cut50, Van Jones and Jessica Jackson Sloan. #cut50 is a national, bipartisan initiative to reduce the U.S.'s incarcerated population by 50 percent over the next 10 years. I asked them about the criticism of the bill.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So let's talk about some of the progressive groups, like the Movement for Black Lives. The coalition of more than 150 black-led organizations has come out against the FIRST STEP Act. They wrote a statement, quote, \"This bill is custom-made for rich white men. All of the carve outs make the vast majority of our people ineligible for the benefits of the bill. Moreover, by mandating post release surveillance the bill opens the door to increased privatization while causing additional harm to the most marginalized of our people. We believe all of this will be done while giving liberal cover to the Trump Administration as they attack, cage, and warehouse Black, brown, and working class people across the country.\" The Movement for Black Lives also points out the bill explicitly excludes immigrants from access to early release and rehab programs and will direct money, say, from early releases to go back into law enforcement. They say the bill encourages profiteering and makes false promises about bringing black prisoners home. Your thoughts, Van?\n\nVAN JONES : Well, I'll say they should have told the Congressional Black Caucus that, because the vast majority of black lawmakers voted for it. And some of those things are not accurate. Let me say this-Jessica is smarter on the policy. Let me just say this: It's called the FIRST STEP Act. It's not the LAST STEP Act; it's the FIRST STEP Act. This bill does not do any harm to anyone. The goodness in the bill doesn't get to as many people. There's good programs in there that don't-everybody can't participate in. The goodness in the bill doesn't get to as many people as we want to, but there is not one additional piece of harm. Not one sentence gets any longer. Nobody serves an extra day. And that, by itself, is something of a victory. And I'll say more after Jessica.\n\nJESSICA JACKSON SLOAN : So, I just wanted to jump in and correct some of that misinformation, because I just don't want to have viewers listening and thinking that that is true. And it's just not.\n\nI've seen the numbers. The U.S. Sentencing Commission actually did an analysis, and the exclusions actually are pretty much across the board for white, black and Hispanic individuals. Those exclusions are for a small part of the bill: the time credits that people can earn by doing programming. There are plenty of pieces of the bill that do apply to everybody who's inside of the prison, regardless of what crime they committed, including the increased good time credit that people can earn off of their sentence for good behavior.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's Jessica Jackson Sloan and Van Jones of #cut50. The FIRST [ STEP ] Act is law now. Your thoughts, Mariame Kaba?\n\nMARIAME KABA : So, I don't know what to say about this. I'm on the Movement for Black Lives Policy Table, so-I don't think you knew that, did you?-as, you know, I endorsed the statement that we put out about this bill, this FIRST STEP Act.\n\nWe are being-we are consistently told-I do want to point-let me backtrack for one second. Just recently, President Trump was accused of being a racist by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. And one of the things that the White House put out as why he actually wasn't racist was that he signed criminal justice reform. Yeah.\n\nI want to say that we knew that this would be used as a lever to weaponize against people of color, actually, in the long term, by an administration that actually does not want us to thrive. It maybe doesn't even want us to survive in this country. That's a fact. People of color are under attack on every level in this country. I don't understand the concept of this being, quote-unquote, \"a first step.\" Well, a first step to what? Because there are a bunch of people who are excluded. And that does is it bifurcates the system. It says certain people are deserving and certain people are undeserving of release. So, any, quote-unquote, \"reform\" or package that actually makes it harder for other people to get out is a package we should not be endorsing.\n\nSo, we believe in, as-I mean, most of the people who are around the Policy Table for the Movement for Black Lives, we believe that everybody deserves the right to get out of prison. And we don't want to make it difficult for certain people while making it easier for others. Also, this, quote, \" FIRST STEP Act\" is so minuscule in whatever positive it might bring to a few people, that we have to ask, \"What is the trade-off to that?\" Right? What is the trade-off to that?\n\nAnd I don't-I don't believe for one second that this administration is going to do something else. I think, from now on, we're going to hear from Republicans that they did, quote-unquote, \"criminal justice reform,\" when that is so not true. Right? That is so not true. So it's making it harder for other people's organizing to take place within this particular landscape.\n\nSo, and I don't want to-and again, I feel terrible having this conversation in this kind of way, because I have had my conversations behind closed doors. I prefer to have it that way with people who you are in community with, you know? But I-you asked me. I'm responding from the perspective of, you know, being honest about where we come from. And I don't think there was misinformation in the statement from the Movement for Black Lives. I just think we don't agree.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to ask you, speaking of prisons, about what's happening here in New York City. Mayor Bill de Blasio came out for the closing of Rikers Island, but at the same time has a plan to build four new jails, four new prisons-in the Bronx, in Queens, in Manhattan and in Brooklyn-which would hold around 1,500 people each.\n\nMARIAME KABA : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Your group, Critical Resistance, is opposed.\n\nMARIAME KABA : That's right. Critical Resistance New York, right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, talk about what's happening.\n\nMARIAME KABA : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : He did come out against Rikers, which no previous mayor had.\n\nMARIAME KABA : Yeah, yeah, he did come out against Rikers, after massive pressure-again, organizing-from local people, who did not say, \"Close Rikers and open up a bunch of decentralized jails.\" That was not the demand, OK? It was \"Close Rikers and decarcerate.\"\n\nSo, I don't understand-we know what is going to happen here. First of all, there will never-some of these jails proposed in these particular boroughs are never going to get built. Why? Because people are not going to stand for it. People are not going to stand for a prison on Staten Island, where all the cops live. Right?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : He didn't say Staten Island, which is interesting.\n\nMARIAME KABA : Well, you know, he took that out of the thing. But people aren't going to-they're going to say, \"Not in my backyard.\" Right? So that means that, likely, these prisons might be built in particular places that are already disenfranchised and divested from. So we'll end up with the same, like, single-site place in a particular community that doesn't have enough power to fight it. That's number one.\n\nNumber two, I do not understand how we are going to get to decarceration in this city or in this state without actual real bail reform. That is partly, like, why people aren't getting at the root causes of why people end up behind bars, why we're not looking at why we don't have a robust substance use and abuse system, why we don't have robust housing, affordable housing, for people in New York, why we're not paying attention to giving people living wage jobs. All of those would decrease the number of people who cycle through our jails. Right? That is not the conversation that's being had. It's just about bricks and mortar. It's just about like buildings. And I think the Close Rikers Campaign here in New York City is really pushing for a reframing of what community safety looks like, and an insistence that we are not going to build a whole bunch of new jails around the country. That completely defeats the purpose.\n\nAlso, I feel like, you know, to be honest, de Blasio is going to be out of office way before any of this stuff comes into being. We don't know what the next administration is planning and what they are trying to do. So, it's important and incumbent on New York City folks to organize to say what we want is decarceration. We want an end to pretrial detention, and we want an end to money bail.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what would an end to money bail look like? How many people would be freed?\n\nMARIAME KABA : So many people, because if you look at the numbers, in this country there are about 700,000 people in our jails around the country on any given day. Eleven million people cycle through U.S. jails in a year. Eleven million. OK? That's a huge number. Out of the 700,000 people who are currently locked up, 450,000 people are locked up because they can't afford to pay bail. That is-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : But the prison population of the country is around 2 million.\n\nMARIAME KABA : Two-point-three million, the prison and jails together. If you're looking at just our jails, that's 700,000. Out of that number, 450,000 are there because they can't afford to pay their bail. That is a debtors' prison. That means-that's criminalizing poverty, and that's wrong. Bail was supposed to exist to ensure that you showed up at your next court date. Why is it then that if you don't have money, you can't get out?\n\nSo, we have people like Harvey Weinstein, accused of multiple sexual assaults; Kevin Spacey-a whole bunch of people right now with-rich white men with money. And they're not sitting in a jail rotting. Right? They could afford to pay their $10 million bail and traipse out into the world.\n\nWe have people locked up in jails right now who die behind bars, because they can't pay $50 to get out. That is immoral. It's egregious. It is part of why we've done things like the Movement for Black Lives and others have come together to do national bailouts. Right? Mama's Day bailouts, Father's Day bailouts, other, to kind of dramatize this problem so people understand what's really going on. But it's just immoral. It's immoral, and it's wrong. And you should not be in jail because you can't afford to get your way out of it.\n\nAnd so, you know, that's a huge thing that needs to happen. And we're being told that there will be bail reform in Albany this year. The promises made by Cuomo are like literally paper thin. You can't-you know, you can't count on him. But if he has any sort of mindset at all for national office, I suggest he get on the move on criminal punishment issues in the state. He's abysmal. His record is abysmal.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Mariame Kaba is an organizer and educator who's worked on anti-domestic violence programs, as well as anti-incarceration and racial justice programs. Kaba is the co-founder of Survived and Punished.\n\nIf you'd like to see Part 1 of this discussion, go to democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman.

President Trump continued to claim without evidence he was the victim of a massive conspiracy to rig the election. Republicans across the country attempted to undermine the election results, and right-wing supporters threatened violence. John Koza, chair of National Popular Vote, says the chaos of the 2020 election is further proof that the United States should abandon the Electoral College system as it is currently constituted and elect presidents by popular vote instead. \"The flaws of the current system have become more and more apparent to people,\" he says.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The Quarantine Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris officially won the Electoral College Monday, as electors met in their state capitals to formalize the victory. This step comes even as President Trump continues to claim without evidence he's the victim of a massive conspiracy to rig the election. Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams presided over Georgia's body of electors, who marked for the first time in nearly three decades Georgia elected a Democrat.\n\nSTACEY ABRAMS : The ballots have been reviewed and transmitted. As I call your name, please state the name of the person for whom you cast for your vote for president. I will start by stating that I cast my vote for President Joe Biden. Gloria Butler?\n\nGLORIA BUTLER : I cast my vote for President Joe Biden.\n\nSTACEY ABRAMS : Wendy Davis?\n\nWENDY DAVIS : I cast my vote for President Joe Biden.\n\nSTACEY ABRAMS : Bobby Fuse?\n\nBOBBY FUSE : I cast my vote for President Joe Biden. ...\n\nSTACEY ABRAMS : I am pleased to announce that Joseph R. Biden has received 16 votes for president of the United States.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : As Stacey Abrams spoke Monday in Georgia, Washington Post reporter Michelle Ye Hee Lee tweeted, quote, \"Meanwhile, in another part of the GA State Capitol, 16 GOP electors cast ballots for Trump, declaring that 'the contest of the election is ongoing.'\" She posted a photo taken by freelance journalist Haisten Willis of the unofficial electors.\n\nElsewhere, in Arizona, a group of fake electors sent the National Archive notarized documents falsely claiming Arizona's 11 electoral votes went to Trump. The 11 real electors, who were actually chosen by Arizona voters, cast their votes for Biden and Harris.\n\nIn Michigan, electors also formally cast their votes for Biden and Harris. The vote came after the Trump administration filed lawsuits that were dismissed by state and federal judges, and despite Trump's attempts to pressure Republican lawmakers to replace Democratic electors. Republican Michigan state Representative Gary Eisen was reprimanded and stripped of his committee assignments after he told a radio host Monday morning he planned to join a protest to obstruct the state's Electoral College vote, that could turn violent. This is Eisen speaking to Port Huron-area radio station WPHM -AM on Monday morning.\n\nPAUL MILLER : What event are you referring to?\n\nREP . GARY EISEN : It'll be all over the news later on.\n\nPAUL MILLER : This sounds dangerous, Gary. And I'm not kidding around.\n\nREP . GARY EISEN : It is dangerous. And I will be there. I was the one - there's going to be violence, going to be protests. You know, and they're asking me if I would assist today. And I said, \"You know what? How can I not?\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : As the official electors in all 50 states met Monday despite right-wing threats of violence, senior White House adviser Stephen Miller appeared on Fox News Monday and claimed Trump and his allies plan to pursue a so-called alternate elector strategy.\n\nSTEPHEN MILLER : The only date in the Constitution is January 20th, so we have more than enough time to right the wrong of this fraudulent election result and certify Donald Trump as the winner of the election. As we speak, today, an alternate slate of electors in the contested states is going to vote, and we're going to send those results up to Congress. This will ensure that all of our legal remedies remain open. That means that if we win these cases in the courts, that we can direct that the alternate slate of electors be certified. The state legislatures in Georgia, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania can do the same. And likewise, Congress has that opportunity, as well, to do the right thing. If you just cured three simple constitutional defects, Donald Trump is the winner of this election.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Despite this, President-elect Joe Biden addressed the nation in a nationally televised speech Monday night, just hours after winning the state-by-state Electoral College vote that officially determines the U.S. presidency.\n\nPRESIDENT - ELECT JOE BIDEN : Together, Vice President-elect Harris and I earned 306 electoral votes, well exceeding the 270 electoral votes needed to secure victory. Three hundred and six electoral votes is the same number of electoral votes that Donald Trump and Vice President Pence received when they won in 2016. Excuse me. At the time, President Trump calls the Electoral College tally a landslide. By his own standards, these numbers represented a clear victory then. And I respectfully suggest they do so now.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We turn now to look at a growing movement to have the president be popularly elected, with or without the Electoral College. To date, 15 states have passed a law that says its electors will go to whichever candidate wins the national popular vote in the country as a whole, regardless of what candidate wins in that particular state. This is known as the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. The compact will not take effect until enough states adopt it so that the aggregate of the electoral votes equals 270 or more, enough to guarantee the presidency to the most popular candidate.\n\nWe're joined now by John Koza, chair of National Popular Vote.\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! It's great to have you with us. Explain what this -\n\nJOHN KOZA : Good morning.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : It's great to see you. Can you explain what this movement is? But first, respond to what happened yesterday in this country. In most other years, the Electoral College vote, people didn't pay much attention to it. But this year, they sure did.\n\nJOHN KOZA : Well, people did pay attention, because the flaws of the current system have become more and more apparent to people. Five of our 45 presidents have come into office without having won the national popular vote. And just in the last six elections, we've had two wrong-winner elections and also two near-miss elections, including this current election. If 21,000 people had changed their mind in Arizona, Wisconsin and Georgia, President Trump would have received enough electoral votes to be reelected, despite the fact that Joe Biden was over 7 million votes ahead in the national popular vote.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: But, John Koza, could you explain a little more about this compact? And I'm wondering, even if you were able to get the number, requisite number, of states to vote in favor of it, what's to prevent Congress from passing legislation to overturn the decisions of the states?\n\nJOHN KOZA : Well, in fact, the Constitution gives the state legislatures the exclusive and plenary power to decide how their electoral votes are awarded. What the Constitutions says is, \"Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of [presidential] Electors.\" Congress has no role in deciding how electoral votes are awarded, as a matter of law. So, it's an exclusive state process.\n\nThe current system, the winner-take-all system that causes these wrong-winner elections, these near-miss elections, and causes the fact that presidential candidates only campaign in a dozen battleground states, those are all state laws. And they can be changed in the same way they were passed: by a vote of the state legislature.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, John Koza, explain the states that have passed this compact, making their way to - well, they're coming close to around 200 votes, need 270, before this is just adopted all over the country. It's not exactly abolishing the Electoral College. It remains. But it really gets rid of what the Electoral College has done in the past, because it will be guided by the popular vote. What states have voted for this? How many more do you need?\n\nJOHN KOZA : Well, the states that have voted for it include four small states - Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island and Vermont - and eight medium-size states - Colorado, where, by the way, the voters just reaffirmed the action of the Colorado Legislature and governor and approved National Popular Vote - Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon and Washington - and then three bigger states - California, Illinois and New York.\n\nWe need states with 74 more electoral votes to put this into effect, hopefully in time for the 2024 presidential elections. And in terms of progress in that direction, there are nine additional states, with 88 electoral votes, where at least one house of the legislature has already passed the National Popular Vote bill. So we're optimistic that we can succeed in putting this into effect in time for the 2024 election.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And in those states where one house of the legislature has approved it but the other has not, when the second house, let's say, approves the bill, does the - because most legislation, if it's not approved by both houses in a term, has to be revoted on, doesn't it? How would that work?\n\nJOHN KOZA : Well, you're absolutely correct. For example, our bill passed the Virginia House early in 2020. But when it comes up in 2021, we will have to go back through the House and pass the Senate. So you're correct. The bills in state legislature, like bills in Congress, have to be restarted when a new legislature comes into being.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what are the states you think are most likely?\n\nJOHN KOZA : Well, we're very optimistic about Virginia. The bill also passed one house in Maine in 2019. And in Michigan in 2018, 25 of the 38 state senators sponsored the bill, including a majority of both parties. And then it passed the Minnesota House in 2019, and some other states.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Now, the Oklahoma Council on Public Affairs says that this is a Democratic blue state effort, and it opposes your proposal. What's your response?\n\nJOHN KOZA : Well, it's a effort of bipartisan proposal. It's received bipartisan support in state after state, including, by the way, the Oklahoma Senate, where we passed the Senate a few years ago with a bipartisan vote. The Oklahoma Council on Public Relations is the leading opponent to National Popular Vote. And they have a lot of wrong opinions. They think the current system is just fine, that it's OK to have second-place, wrong-winner elections, that it's OK to have all these recounts and lawsuits and litigation, which comes from the winner-take-all law, and that it's OK that presidential campaigns are focused on just a dozen battleground states and leave 38 states basically as spectators to the presidential election.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you talk to us a little bit about the history of the Electoral College? Why was it created in the first place? And why has it been such a durable institution in American politics?\n\nJOHN KOZA : Well, the Electoral College itself is in the Constitution, and it allocates electoral votes among the states, but it doesn't actually say how the members of the Electoral College are appointed. So it's durable because it's in the Constitution. It's in the Constitution because at the time the Constitution was written, the Southern states wanted to have more representation than the number of people who were allowed to vote would justify - that's a polite way of saying the slaves. So, to form the union, this compromise was arranged where the states would receive a certain number of electoral votes based on the number of people in those states. But then the states, notably the Southern states, could have only, say, rich white people allowed to vote.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So it is based in slavery.\n\nJOHN KOZA : By the way, rich white men.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : John Koza, I want to thank you so much for being with us. And we're going to continue to look at this, of course. Chair of National Popular Vote, consulting professor at Stanford University in computer science and electrical engineering, he was. He's also former CEO of Scientific Games.\n\nNext up, as the U.S. COVID -19 death toll tops 300,000, cases are spiking across the prisons of this country. We'll get an inside update from San Quentin.

The report, called \"And Justice for Some,\" found that youth of color are more likely than their counterparts to be arrested, held in jail, sent to juvenile or adult court for trial, and convicted and given longer prison terms. And blacks are more than six times as likely as whites to be sentenced by juvenile courts to prison. [includes rush transcript]\n\nToday, we are talking with author Jonathan Kozol. He started as a 4th grade teacher in Boston public schools at the height of the civil rights movement in 1964 and 1965. He became known for his book ??Death at an Early Age, which discusses his first year of teaching. His latest book, ??Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope, looks at the life of children in a South Bronx neighborhood, the poorest Congressional district in the country.\n\nHe takes us along the daily wanderings of children from the classroom of their school to the sanctuary of their church, and then into the streets where they walk and the stores where they buy their candy, and then into their homes with their mothers and grandmothers.\n\nI believe the questions we should be asking about justice and injustice in America are not chiefly programmatic technical or scientific. They are theological but I disagree with those who think we should be asking questions of theology primarily to those who live in poverty. I think we need to ask these questions of ourselves.\n\nGuest:\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Juan, from Vieques back to Vietnam, as we see this weekend the twenty-fifth anniversary of the fall of Saigon and peace in Vietnam. You were certainly a well-known activist back then, not to emphasize your age.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Right, and not to emphasize one of the highlights of my criminal record, right? My arrest by FBI agents for refusing to participate in the draft. But, yes, it's clearly - the little attention that's being given to this anniversary throughout the rest of the major media is amazing, considering the phenomenal impact that the Vietnam War had on American society and on those who are in power, the generation that is in power today in American society, that so little attention is being given to looking back at Vietnam.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, April 30th is the actual date, and we'll be doing our special on Monday on Democracy Now! We'll be bringing you such luminaries as Noam Chomsky, speaking on the issue and talking about the lessons and legacies twenty-five years later, what's different and what remains the same. The activism goes way back twenty-five years against the war, and also it was a time of tremendous activism in the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nAnd today, we're joined by someone who took an interesting journey at that time. Jonathan Kozol is with us. Jonathan Kozol, author of many books. His first book written in the late 1960s about his civil rights activism. He was a fourth grade teacher in the Boston Public Schools in 1964 and 1965 and wrote a book about his experience called Death at an Early Age . Well, he's written an number of books since then, and his latest is called Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope . Jonathan Kozol is our guest. Welcome to Democracy Now!\n\nJONATHAN KOZOL : Thanks. It's good to be here with you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, in this book, you've continued in the South Bronx, talking to children and looking at the world [inaudible] in this book, in particular through their own eyes and through their voices. You go to the poorest congressional district in the country in the South Bronx, and you take us on the daily wanderings of children from the classrooms of their school to the sanctuary of their church and then into the streets where they walk and the stores where they buy their candy and into their homes with their mothers and grandmothers. It really is, in this poorest congressional district, a story of hope.\n\nJONATHAN KOZOL : Well, it is, for an unusual reason. I mean, these are some of the poorest kids I've ever known in the United States, and I've been at this for thirty-five years. But the ordinary resurrections are the resurrections of the heart in black and Latino kids who simply will not die, despite the worst a racist and unequal nation does to them.\n\nAnd there are a lot of reasons why it's hopeful. One is that these are very young kids. These are mostly six- and eight-year-olds. So they're too young and innocent to understand that their nation doesn't like them very much. They'll find that out when they get older, but at this point they're still very sweet and trusting. They're not all angels, you know. These aren't like poster children for the poor. I don't like that kind of writing. They're angelic in some cases and maddening in other cases, but they're not little criminals, they're not little predators, they're not precocious grown-ups, as a lot of ignorant sociology would have us believe. They're as diverse and interesting and funny and loving as almost any kids you'd meet anywhere.\n\nIf fact, the only way in which they're really different from middle class kids that I know in the United States is that they're more sensitive to times when a friend or even a grown-up needs some emotional support. They're among the most generous kids I've ever met, and they're also deeply religious children. I mean, they're terribly religious kids.\n\nI happen to be Jewish, so it was sort of an interesting experience for me. I was of that generation that grew up in the 1950s. I was religious when I was a kid, but then I went to Harvard, and that of course ruined it all, because at Harvard, even if you believed in God you wouldn't admit it, because they'd look at you clinically, you know. Maybe you need a referral for a little mental health if you talk about God. So I spent a lot of my life, especially because I've been a political radical most of my life, and you know on the left people are kind of nervous about religion. So, you know, I spent almost my whole life pretending that I was very detached and urbane and sort of ironical about these things, you know, like the New York Times . It's sort of - well, it's interesting that they believe that, but not me. So in a sense, something important was stolen from me by this pretense of sophistication, and I'm grateful that these little kids in the South Bronx gave it back to me.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Well, that's one of the things I noted in reading through the book, that there was a spiritual journey on your part through the process of doing this book, and I remember you talking about your experiences with a young girl, Pineapple, when you went to visit her, and that someone, when you're leaving her apartment, says to you, \"This is a place where you can get some church.\"\n\nJONATHAN KOZOL : Oh, yeah. I love that. Actually, that happened when I walked into a storefront church on Brook Avenue one night, and a man who knew I wasn't from the neighborhood looked at me and said, \"If you're looking to get you some church, you came to the right place.\" And what I say in the book is that when I'm with kids like Pineapple, it feels like I'm in a church, because these kids, even in their kitchens at home, have a kind of spiritual glory about them, which just renews my heart. Honest to God, it does.\n\nAnd, you know, to all my old liberal and left friends who are listening to us now, and I haven't given up my politics, I haven't traded in political struggle for spiritual ambiguity or anything like that. I am still a fighter, and I still get mad as hell every time I read about or see first-hand the vicious inequalities that these kids face, and those inequalities are worse now than they've ever been. But still, knowing these children has been a kind of renewal for me.\n\nAnd you know, it's the end of a long journey, and I started at this in 1964, when I started teaching black kids in Boston and moved into the black community there and became a housing organizer and went to jail. In fact, you spoke of Noam Chomsky before. The last time I saw Noam was when we were in jail together a long, long time ago.\n\nBut who would have dreamt that this journey of mine would have ended this way? You know, I start with a book called Death at an Early Age , but they didn't die as easily as I thought. And so, in a way, I'm glad I've lived long enough to discover that and could write a book about their resurrection.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : It's interesting you mentioned before the super-predator theme, because clearly just a few years ago people like Dilulio were warning American society that we were on the cusp of the development of the super-predator from the ghetto and that the reality of poverty and homelessness was creating a type of youth criminal that would be far worse than anything that American society had expected. Actually, the reverse has happened.\n\nJONATHAN KOZOL : That's right.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : As the unemployment level dropped and people began to work and young people actually were able to find some jobs, and not even decent paying jobs, you've had an enormous decline in the crime rate and nothing like what these prognosticators were suggesting.\n\nJONATHAN KOZOL : Oh, I agree with you completely. And, I mean, anybody who spends - even conservative ideologues or tough-minded business CEOs who occasionally wander up to St. Ann's Church - sometimes they've read one of my books, and they just - I don't know, they have a moment of madness, and they decide to get on the train and go the wrong direction, for them, you know. And they end up at St. Ann's at the After School, which is where a lot of the book takes place, or at PS 30, which is a good public school, that I describe, with a marvelous principal, Ida Rosa. And, you know, they end up there, and it's interesting. As soon as they get to know the kids, all their ideologies evaporate. It's wonderful what reality can do, even to a hard-nosed bigot. You know, they stop talking about lean and mean agendas as soon as they meet real children.\n\nBut I have to say, if we want to talk about crime, the crime I worry about is not the alleged criminal behavior of these little kids. The crime I worry about is the massive crime of a society that viciously short-changes them year after year after year, who locks them into the most segregated public schools in the United States. The shame of the nation, I must say, that New York City, which still has this vaguely liberal image, the city which once thought it could send its best kids south to break the back of apartheid in Mississippi, now is the bastion of educational apartheid in the United States, and the most unequal schools in the United States. I mean, these little kids get $8,000 a year for their education - poorest children in New York. Eight thousand bucks for a nice little girl like Pineapple. You lift her up and plunk her down in the rich white suburbs, like Great Neck or Manhasset, which are sort of like Beverly Hills, where all the ex-liberals live, and she'd be getting $20,000 a year put into her education. So, you know, when I hear people say, \"Well, we had discrimination once in the past in the United States. Is that any reason for Affirmative Action?\" I always say, \"There's nothing past about discrimination in this country, not in this city. Discrimination is alive and soaring.\"\n\nSo, you know, if we're going to talk about criminal behavior, I would talk about the criminal behavior of the Wall Street executives and the banking interests and the real-estate interests and the all-too-moderate press in New York City, that sort of over-civilized press, which makes a cult of civility at the expense of the poor, which will not name the sin in its own front yard, you know. They'll talk about injustice everywhere else in the world, but they won't talk about this.\n\nAnd, you know, I don't know if Juan remembers this, but there's been a huge children's prison right off the South Bronx for the past three years. It's a prison barge. It's a barge. It's like something from Dickens's England. It was for grown-ups. For years, it was used for men, but the past three years, they put children there. There were thousands of kids put out there every year, virtually all of them black and Hispanic. They just closed the barge. They put these kids into a brand new, spectacular children's prison, right on St. Ann's Avenue, eight blocks from the church where I visit these kids. It's the most expensive new building in the South Bronx. It's the only new school building in the South Bronx, and it has a class size of twelve, whereas the public schools have thirty. And, listen to this, we spend $93,000 a year to keep a child in that children's prison, and $8,000 to educate them in the public schools.\n\nYou want to talk about criminal behavior, Mr. Dilulio shouldn't waste his time with sweet little kids like Pineapple. He should look at his rich friends who run this society. There's the real criminality. And from a religious point of view, there's the theologically evil aspect of our society.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Jonathan Kozol. His latest book is called Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope . He has won numerous awards for his writings that go back to Death at an Early Age . He's stayed on the same issue. His passion has only been fueled for the last, well, more than thirty years. As we talk about these issues in this campaign year, what about vouchers and where you see vouchers taking us?\n\nJONATHAN KOZOL : Oh, vouchers are the worst idea that has come into the public education debate in my adult lifetime. I mean, for me, it's not a new issue, because I started fighting vouchers back shortly after the Brown decision was implemented. Vouchers have the historical origin in Southern segregationists. Vouchers were their idea for dodging the public school system, for creating neat little schools of their own but using tax money to fund it.\n\nIn recent years, the right wing has been very clever and ingenious in building a constituency among people of color. In New York, the rightwing Manhattan Institute has been particularly brilliant at finding a following amongst poor people. The way they do it is this: You starve the public schools. You underpay the teachers. You don't build new school buildings for, it seems like, a hundred years in this city, unless it's for rich kids who go to schools like Stuyvesant, and then you come to the poor, desperate parents and you say, \"Hey, for a few of your kids, we'll start a neat little boutique school of our own. And you support a voucher system, and we'll save your kid.\"\n\nSo, essentially, what vouchers amount to are a triage solution. You pull out the children of the savvy parents, the parents who are most aggressive. Even in a poor community, even amongst very poor people, there are some parents who are always in the loop, they're well-connected, the same mothers who know how to get their kid into Head Start when there's not enough space for anyone else, the same mother who somehow figures a way to avoid Lincoln Hospital and get her kids into a ritzy hospital. That's the kind of mother who hears about the neat little voucher school, if that's what we can call it. She'll get her kid in, and from then on, she won't be fighting for anybody else. So it's not just that we lose public money to a private school under a voucher system, we also lose the advocacy of some of those parents, whom we need so desperately in the PTA in the public school.\n\nThere's another part of it that's even more dangerous, and nobody on the left talks about this, but they ought to. When people talk about vouchers, they generally picture - the typical voucher school would be like a Catholic school. You know, and there are some good Catholic schools in the South Bronx. There are few that I visit, and I don't know why it is - I'm Jewish - but the Jesuits love me. And so, they always ask me to visit their schools. And there's a couple of good Catholic schools, and I'd do anything for them. If I can help them raise money at a fundraiser, I'd do it any day of the week.\n\nBut I don't want public money to go to them, because if public money, if vouchers can go to a Roman Catholic school or a cute little Montessori school, which all the liberals would like on the West Side of Manhattan, the money constitutionally would have to be given also to a David Duke school, a Patrick Buchanan school, any kind of rightwing extremist school, a malicious school, or, on the other extreme, to a Louis Farrakhan school. In other words, there's no way you could put this genie back in the bottle once you let it out. And just imagine what that would do to a city like New York.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : And, of course, there are those who point to the Catholic schools as examples of schools that are in - with fewer resources, that are in the poor communities, but actually work. Of course, having been raised a Catholic and always having had to battle within my family between those of us who went public school versus Catholic school, there's a reality that the Catholic schools can still get to pick and choose. If a kid is misbehaving, he gets expelled and has to go to a public school. And also, they never have to deal with problems such as disabled children or the cost of educating the disabled or children with learning disabilities. And so, obviously, the cost of the public schools is always greater, because they've got to deal with everyone.\n\nJONATHAN KOZOL : That's a crucial point. I mean, the fact is, I happen to like the - I've made close friends with some of the priests and nuns in the South Bronx, and they're good souls, and I'd do anything to help them. But they are selective, and even if they don't know they're selective, their enrollment is self-selective, because even to know about places like that and come up with even the $2,000 a year that you have to pay to go to those schools really does cream off the least poor of the poor. And that's the point, which most of the priests will admit when they're being candid about it to me in private.\n\nJust one last thing I have to say, that nobody says anything good about public school teachers anymore. There are some terrific public school teachers in New York. At PS 30, which is a good public school in the South Bronx with a marvelous principal - Miss Rosa is just like a mother lion. She's Puerto Rican, but I call her my Jewish Puerto Rican grandma. She welcomes everybody with a hug. Kids love her, and because of her warmth of personality, she has attracted a good faculty. I would tell you that more than half her teachers, any time of the week, could quit the South Bronx, go out to a system like Scarsdale, you know, an expensive suburban district, and earn $25,000 more a year for a much smaller class size with far more resources. They stay in the neighborhood, because they love that principal and they love the kids. They're loyal to the kids. Teachers get too much bashing in this country nowadays, you know. To me, these teachers are really heroes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, on that note, I want to thank you very much for being with us, Jonathan Kozol. His latest book, Ordinary Resurrections: Children in the Years of Hope , it's published by Crown. Thank you.\n\nJONATHAN KOZOL : Thanks very much.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nWeb exclusive conversation with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Glenn Greenwald about the Brazilian election. Far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro has been elected Brazil's next president, marking the most radical political shift in the country since military rule ended more than 30 years ago. Bolsonaro, a former military officer, openly supports torture and dictatorships, has a history of making racist, misogynistic and homophobic comments, and has threatened to destroy, imprison or banish his political opponents.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, as we continue to look at Brazil, where a far-right former Army officer who openly supports dictatorships and torture has been overwhelmingly elected president. Jair Bolsonaro's election marks the most radical political shift in Brazil since military rule ended more than 30 years ago. He won 55 percent of the vote, easily defeating Fernando Haddad of the leftist Workers' Party.\n\nStill with us in Rio de Janeiro for Part 2 of our discussion is the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Glenn Greenwald, one of the founding editors of The Intercept .\n\nGlenn, we spoke to you before this election. Now President Trump has just tweeted, congratulating Jair Bolsonaro. But, Glenn, while people protested in the streets as his victory was announced, 55 percent of Brazilians-and you can explain who votes and who doesn't-voted for this far-right former Army official.\n\nGLENN GREENWALD : Exactly, and I think that's a critical point. It is true that Bolsonaro won wealthier neighborhoods, predominantly white regions of the country. So the upper class was absolutely, at least in the second round, supportive of Bolsonaro. He wasn't the primary choice of the establishment in the first round, but in the second round they were behind him. But Brazil is a country with massive inequality, and a tiny percentage of its population is rich. So the only way you win 55 percent of the vote in a country where voting is mandatory is if you also win a huge number of people who are anything but rich and anything but white and anything but ensconced in safe enclaves. So, I think that it's very important to avoid the storyline that fascism won because rich white people got behind it. They did get behind it, but a huge number of other people got behind it, or else he wouldn't have won.\n\nAnd the reason they got behind it is not necessarily because they support fascism. A lot of them have spent the last 16 years voting for the center-left Workers' Party. It's because they feel like the ruling class of Brazil, which includes not only the oligarchical class but also the center-left establishment of PT that has governed the country for 14 years, has turned their back on them and failed them. And when that happens, when enough people in the country perceive that the ruling and establishment class do not care about their futures and don't care about their welfare, they're going to run into the arms of demagogues, who, rightly or wrongly, accurately or inaccurately, are portraying themselves as outsiders to that system and are threatening to burn it down. And that's the lesson of Brazil, but also of the U.S. and European democracies, as well, that we are very reluctant to embrace.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you describe what the jailing of Lula, the previous president-well, before Dilma Rousseff, who also was impeached, his successor-what this meant, since he was the front-running presidential candidate but then was jailed?\n\nGLENN GREENWALD : So, Lula is obviously a singular political force. There's almost nobody like him, even in the entire democratic world, when it comes to charisma and the ability to connect with people on a visceral level. There's certainly no leftist leader anywhere in the world like him. And so, the project of Brazilian elites for the last three or four years has been to destroy PT and finally remove them from power, because they thought they were going to get this center-right, banker-friendly party and candidate in their place. It all backfired terribly.\n\nBut that plan could only work if Lula was banned from running. The only way you could ban Lula from running is if you quickly imprisoned him on [corruption] charges and then upheld that conviction in a very fast and dubious way, which is what happened. So, Lula's imprisonment was done under very questionable circumstances, to put that mildly. It was obviously carried out with the intention to bar him from running.\n\nAnd it is true that public opinion polls showed him as the front-runner. I think we should be cautious, though, about assuming that had Lula been able to run, he would have won. It's certainly possible. But even those early polls showed him at 35, 38 percent. A lot of these polls showed early on that Bolsonaro was very, very low in the polls, at 20 percent, not really able to get over that. I think it's very possible that the climate of the country was such that they were going to reject anyone associated enough with the old political system, even Lula. But certainly, just because of his personal charisma and connection to the populace and the popularity that he had because of his success, he was by far the candidate most likely to win from the left, which is why, for sure, they ended up imprisoning and barring his candidacy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I'd like to turn to comments Bolsonaro made earlier this month, speaking to a crowd of supporters through his cellphone, when he pledged a cleansing never seen before.\n\nJAIR BOLSONARO : [translated] We are the majority. We will build a new nation. They lost in 2016, and they will lose again next week. Only the cleansing will now be much wider: Either they leave or go to jail. These red outcasts will be banished from our homeland. And, Lula da Silva, you're going to rot in jail. Wait for Haddad to get there, too. Since you love each other so much, you're going to rot in jail. ... It will be a cleansing never seen before in Brazilian history. You will see proud armed forces, a civilian and a military police with legal backing to enforce the law against you. Criminals from the Landless Workers' Movement, criminals of the Homeless Workers' Movement, your actions will be typified as terrorism.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that is Jair Bolsonaro right before this election. Talk about the significance of what he is-what he means by this \"cleansing\" and the military and the police going after-and for those who aren't familiar around the world-the landless movement, the Workers' Party, etc., Glenn.\n\nGLENN GREENWALD : Yeah. So, I hope nobody needs me to explain how terrifying that language is. I mean, I wasn't personally surprised by it, but a lot of people who had declared their neutrality-I'm talking about prominent, influential people in Brazil who have long been in the center or even the center-right and hate PT-were so alarmed by that unhinged rhetoric that they actually declared their support for PT, saying, \"I never thought that I would do this ever in my life, but I'm voting for PT, because although PT has robbed me for the last 15 years, they've never threatened me this way.\"\n\nSo, as I said in the first part of the show, what's not being fully appreciated about Bolsonaro is that he's not part of this newer \"alt-right\" movement, but instead comes from the military regime that ruled the country for 21 years during the Cold War and carried out, like all of these far-right anti-communist regimes did, atrocities that they thought were justified in the name of fighting communism. And there's a really moving and remarkable op-ed in this morning's New York Times that I would encourage all of your viewers to read, by a Brazilian writer named Marcelo [Paiva], whose father, during the dictatorship, was an elected member of Congress, a socialist-not a communist, but a socialist. And when the military junta took over Brazil, with the help of the U.S. and the U.K., they simply canceled his mandate in Congress. They removed him from Congress. And then, one day, a couple years later, they came to his house, arrested him, his wife and his 15-year-old daughter, in front of their three small children, took them to where people were tortured, and they never saw their father again. He was tortured to death over the next 48 hours.\n\nThose are the kinds of atrocities that were committed by the very people that Bolsonaro-who are still alive today, and that Bolsonaro intends to empower and who he explicitly wants to replicate. So, again, it's hard to put into words the kind of threats that are posed to basic human rights and the right of dissent and democratic values, as he made very clear in that speech that you just played.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Brazil's dictatorship ended in 1985. Do you think Brazil's Congress, the Legislature, the Supreme Court are strong enough to keep him in check, or even to survive?\n\nGLENN GREENWALD : I don't think anyone knows the answer to that. First of all, the Congress, it's important to point out, has been flooded with the far-right movement of which Bolsonaro was a part. People that no one had ever heard of two months ago were swept into office by virtue of nothing other than affiliating themselves with Bolsonaro. So he has huge support in the Congress for whatever it is he wants to do.\n\nThe question of the court, his son got caught on tape just three months ago-it was just released and found in the last week-when he was asked what he would do if the Supreme Court tried to impede his father's ascension to power or his agenda, basically said, \"Well, we could just send a tank and an army to outside of the Supreme Court, and I don't think anyone's going to go into the street in support of the Supreme Court.\"\n\nSo, the only faction that can really impose limits on Bolsonaro is the military. And that is the big looming question, is, on the one hand, you have a military that obviously ran the country under the dictatorship and is still connected to the people who did it; on the other hand, they now have had three decades of being inculcated with the idea that their principal patriotic duty is to defend democracy and the constitution from anyone who might threaten it. And so, they're now definitely consolidated behind Bolsonaro. For a long time, they hated Bolsonaro, because they thought that he made the military look bad, when they were trying to rehabilitate their reputation. They're now united behind him. But that is the big mystery, is: To what extent will the military kind of be a backstop, protecting democracy and the constitution against Bolsonaro, the way, say, the Turkish Army used to do, before Erdogan, when it came to protecting Turkish democracy? That's the question no one knows the answer to.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Glenn, what role did both social media play, and also the stabbing of Bolsonaro, what effect did that have?\n\nGLENN GREENWALD : Social media played an enormous role. And in this country, in Brazil, for a long time, the corporate media was even more dominant than it was, say, in the U.S. in the 1980s and the 1990s, before the proliferation of cable news and the internet. All of the information was centralized in the hands of a tiny number of television outlets, owned by the same four or five rich families that had the same political ideology. It was impossible to win the election without their support.\n\nThey didn't support Bolsonaro, at least from the beginning. He really was a candidate of the internet. He was created and driven-his movement was-by young people who were very internet savvy. They circumvented the establishment media institutions. They used WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned free telephone communications service, to spread all kinds of mass information, much of which were just outright lies about PT and about Bolsonaro. So, their ability to exploit these new means of communication, to disseminate their messaging, but also lies, was a huge part of why he won.\n\nAnd the stabbing of Bolsonaro, which really came very close to killing him-had he arrived at the hospital two minutes earlier, he would have been dead-created a huge amount of sympathy for him. It humanized him as a victim. And it also made it impossible to attack him for almost a full month, because it's very hard to attack somebody who is in a hospital bed with tubes connected to them. And so it created a vacuum where he was kind of just seen as this humanized victim who you felt sorry for and who also seemed to be a victim of the violent crime that he had spent his whole campaign denouncing. It gave him the excuse to avoid all political debates. And so he was never really forced to defend the types of things that he has been advocating or the things that he said. And obviously, we'll never know what would have happened, had he not been stabbed, but there's no question that ended up being a huge help to him.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Do you see his victory as part of what's happening in Latin America-you have the right-wing electoral victories in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru-and then, you know, globally, as well, including places like Hungary with Orbán?\n\nGLENN GREENWALD : Yeah. I mean, look, politics is really no longer domestic. Politics is regional, and politics is global. It's in part because we live in a globalized world, and it's in part because the internet is so pervasive in places where, until very recently, it didn't exist. And so, ideologies that thrive in the most powerful and richest countries in the world-in the U.S., in Canada and in Western Europe-now infiltrate much more easily into places that had previously been immune to them. So, I absolutely see what's happening in Brazil, in one sense, as being the byproduct of unique Brazilian dynamics, the convergence of these multiple scandals, in a way that really doesn't exist elsewhere. But I see it more so as part of a regional and global trend that has a lot of the dynamics that we already discussed.\n\nBut I want to add to that the fact that I do think that the left needs to ask itself why it is increasingly failing to be able to communicate to and provide answers for the fears and the anxieties and the resentments that huge portions of the population, who are not really ideologically entrenched on the right, are harboring. And I think that is a major question that the Brazilian left needs to ask itself, but also the Western left, which is: Why is it that the people who live in the interior, who are economically repressed, who feel unrepresented by the power structure-why are they turning away from the left, which sees itself as representing those kind of people, who are marginalized and economically repressed, and turning instead to this kind of nationalistic, populist right? The instinct is just to call those people names, to accuse them of xenophobia and racism and misogyny. A lot of that may be true in a lot of cases. But there's a lot more to it than that. And I think that that kind of soul searching needs to be done on the left, if any of these dynamics, that are obviously disturbing, are to be stemmed and then reversed.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mentioned all these countries. And, of course, here in the United States-and elections are coming up in just a week, and we'll see what effect these attacks of the last-just of the last week, of just hours, will have, from the killing of African Americans in Louisville to the bomb threats sent to Trump opponents all over the country, a kind of Trump hit list, attack list, and of course the Pittsburgh massacre.\n\nGLENN GREENWALD : Yeah. And, you know, I think that one of the things that's likely to happen, unfortunately, in the U.S.-I mean, fortunately and unfortunately-is that, in general, parties that are out of power do very well in the midterm elections. And there's a huge amount of enthusiasm on the part of the Democratic base because of the anti-Trump sentiment that has been building up over the course of more than two years. So I think Democrats are likely to do very well in the midterms, probably will take over the House.\n\nAnd while that's very good in one way, because that will serve as a much-needed limit and check on what Trump's able to do, on the other hand, I think that's going to end up masking the fundamental problems of the Democratic Party-who it's funded by, whose interests it serves, its messaging. It never really engaged in much of a self-critique after 2016, even though it collapsed as a national political force. And I think that its likely victory in 2018, at least in the House, is probably going to give it the excuse needed to justify continuing to push off this kind of reckoning that's needed if the Democrats are going to start to recapture so many of their old voters who have turned away from them.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Glenn Greenwald, I want to thank you very much for being with us, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, one of the founding editors of The Intercept .

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nWe hear a speech by African-American writer, poet and civil rights activist, Alice Walker speaking at the Black Women Writers Dissecting Globalization event in New York. Alice Walker is author of many books and essays, including The Color Purple , for which she won the Pulitzer prize. [includes rush transcript]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : But right now, we're going to turn to Alice Walker, looking at artists, actors who have become fiercely politicized in this time. Alice walker, who wrote the book The Color Purple . Her latest book is called Now is the Time to Open Your Hearts . She recently came to New York to be part of a conference sponsored by the Organization of Women Writers of Africa. It took place at New York University. This is Alice Walker.\n\nALICE WALKER : I want to tell that you three weeks ago I went down to my birthplace in Georgia. I was born in the middle of the deep, deep, deep countryside. Very beautiful. But I went because we had just discovered, someone in Georgia just discovered the grave of my great, great grandmother, Sally Montgomery Walker. She was born in 1861, she died in 1900. She was buried with four of her children, and she was in this forested area, and nobody had ever talked about how she died. She died very young. She was buried with four children, and there was no word of this in my family. My sense of it is that her ending was probably so bad, and there were a lot of endings that were bad in my family, and in the families of many people who were enslaved. She, of course, was born during slavery. But no word about what happened to her, what happened to her and her children. So, I went back to pay my respects and to take flowers, and I was lucky enough to be able to get my Ugandan roommate - when I was at Spellman my roommate was this wonderful woman from Uganda who made me care deeply about Africans and African women. In fact I went to Uganda trying to understand how Constance had been created and produced by this country which before Idi Amin was very beautiful, very tranquil and green. So anyway Constance and I and my entire women's council - I belonged to a women's council - went to visit this grave.\n\nNow this part of where I grew up is like so much of the world. It's being completely overrun by rich white people. So in order to get to this grave, we had to ask permission of these white people in their big, ugly house. As I was getting out of the car, carrying my bouquet of flowers, I mean, the whole armful of flowers, all of these - all of the women in my women's council, all of us very, you know, clearly going to a place that means something to us. So, out of the house comes this Miss Somebody. And she has in her hand a flyer from The Color Purple film. And she honestly says, \"Will you sign this?\" So, we continued through her, and went on and did what we must do. We did what we must do. We must honor the people who have been before us. We must show them that we are here. We sat there - my Constance from Uganda, my friend Belvee from - I mean, so many of us with so many histories that are so painful. Belvee's mother had been actually beaten to death. So, we had a long time of crying there. We watered those graves with our tears. We were happy to do it.\n\nSo, from this woman, from Sally Montgomery Walker, and Jim Walker, her father, who actually outlived her. In my family, we live to be a long time - we live to be really old. One of my great, great, great grandmothers lived to be 125. So, you know, just - we can outlive them. She outlived everybody who would have owned her. I'm just telling you these things to give you some idea who we are. We can live a long time. We better eat better. And exercise. So, anyway, this woman somehow produced eventually my father and my father and mother produced our family. My father was a sharecropper, my mother, too. Very poor. I was just thinking today, did I ever see a doctor? I only saw one, I think, in my entire childhood. Nobody could afford it. And this, you know, my father sometimes making as much as $300 a year, when they deigned to pay him anything, usually at the end of the year, they came and said, you owe me, or you have to move. And we moved every year.\n\nSo, this is to remind you, you know - this, what we have endured already, some of us, is what they plan for the rest of the world. This is it. This is it. Get really clear. This is a toxic culture. It is a culture that eats people, that eats beauty. It cannot live without feeding, and it is insatiable. It cares nothing for us, really. And it helps to really understand that deeply, deeply, deeply - to make women's councils, to have groups of our own, to have places where we grow, where we are seen, where we are appreciated, and where we are loved. Just remember that this is a culture that we did not design. We did not design this. When you look at your TV, you will have some idea of the insanity of it. You know, until you are addicted then you think it's sane, but really it is insane. It is an insane culture. And it's very, very hard for us to thrive here. Very hard. But we have to. We have to thrive. We have to continue, partly because - -\n\nIs that the sign of stopping? No? Oh. I just got a cell phone. It's very miraculous. But the only problem with the cell phone, I think, is that the substance that is in it that makes it work is from the Congo. You know this already. I'm convinced that the grief that the people are suffering in the Congo as they rip off this material will end up really hurting us. So, be very careful. Use that thing very, very little. You know, very little. It cannot - something connected to such evil cannot be good for us. Really. So, I - there are a couple of other things I wanted to mention. I mean, I haven't - I haven't any notes. I just brought myself, and I figure, you know, this - this is it. Myself is it.\n\nI was looking at a film earlier, and somebody was saying, well, what about Alice Walker and Audrey Laura and these white men. I thought, oh, honey, please. You know, can you believe that with everything that's going on in the world, people really care who you sleep with? I mean, isn't it just amazing?\n\nBut anyway, I wanted to mention one of the - one of the projects that I have given myself is to travel the world to see how the people are doing. You know? And I encourage that for Americans, because do you know there are only 14% of Americans have passports. And that's one of the reasons when they see bombs falling on other countries, they don't know what it's falling on. They can't make the leap. As sad as that is to think about, but we have to go. We have to travel. We have to travel to see the people. We have to remember that we are our country. You know, forget about being, quote, an American, big fat A, and acting that way, which is so horrible. You have ever been in places where you see Americans come trooping in, you know, wanting their burgers, and just making the people feel really, just like killing them? But we have to go. We have to go to see how the people are doing. So, in the last year, I have been to many places. I was in Cuba. The people are holding on. The people are carrying on. You know, they're just amazing, in their tenacity and in their feeling about what it means to be human. I was in Hawaii, which I consider a country, not a state. And similarly to - similarly to my experience in Georgia, the white people are just basically taking over the place, and there was a woman - they had just snuck this huge house - they managed to build a huge house in this area, one of the last sacred Hawaiian places. And somehow they had done it. I think they had a painting of the landscape that they put up so people when they looked toward the ocean, they just see the painting, and they didn't see this huge house going up. There's a huge house now and that's in everybody's view. They all hate it, and plus, the house pad was laid out over 19 graves of Hawaiians. Now, Miss - Miss - Miss Carol, Miss whatever - Miss, you know - Miss. Miss says, now, the reason we moved here is because we love the multicultural diversity. Wait a minute, Miss is not done. Then Miss says, and because my house is going to be decorated in the Nepalese style, I think we will just fit right in. So, the people there are suffering. People are suffering. People are suffering deeply. The same displacement, the same people coming with no consciousness about where they're going, who they are with, what the people are doing, what the whole thing is about. None.\n\nAnd then I went to South Korea. That's where the people, you know, when you see them, they are looking really good. They're all, you know, - what happens when this country bombs other people and really makes them suffer for decades, you know later after they have beaten them to a pulp, they just give them stuff. Our taxes, but - so, they all have, you know, cars and gadgets and good schools, and, you know, all of the things that in the ghetto, you cannot find, really around here. So, it's all there. On the other hand, they have incredible pollution because it all is just really fast. There's not much planning. Then I went to a women's island off the coast of South Korea, and they just discovered that when during the Korean war, when the US bombed as far down as Seoul and destroyed most of the city, they continued to an island that is now called Woman's Island - Jeju Island - where apparently and they have just been able to talk about this, our government slaughtered 13,000 men on that island as communists. So that's part of the reason it's now a women's island. You know, all of those men, whether they were communists or not, were wiped out. So, there's all of that happening. But the part - and the feminists in South Korea are wonderful. They're very strong. Very energetic. They almost wore me - I mean, I crawled back on that plane to come home because they worked me so hard, you know going around talking to people. But the part that was hardest for me to deal with, and this - you know, we really have to work so hard with our children, and part of it is trying to figure out how to raise them in a toxic culture without killing - you know, the culture killing them. So, in this place where all of the people have all of the gadgets, all of the cars and everything, they also have an incredible amount of plastic surgery. So that they are all trying to make their eyes round. They're all trying to make their noses, you know, skinny. They're all trying to do stuff to their cheeks. The feminists, you know, who are the ones who are holding the consciousness about this are just having a very difficult time, and in fact, the only reason this had become something of a thing was because there was a school for gifted children, and on the day that all these gifted children graduated, their parents took the entire class for plastic surgery. So - and then I was telling this to a friend, and he found out that these same plastic surgeons in South Korea now are being brought into China to work on their faces.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Alice Walker, speaking at the Organization of African Writers, a conference held recently here in New York at New York University.

      "text": "Rich white men rule America. How much longer will we tolerate that?\n\nMinority rule has always been a feature of American democracy. These days, however, it is getting worse\n\nT he core democratic principle is that people should have a meaningful say in political decisions that affect their lives. In Alabama, we've just seen what the opposite of democracy looks like: 25 white male Republicans in the state senate were able to ban almost all abortion in the state . The consequences of that decision fall exclusively on women, who will be forced to carry all pregnancies to term if the law comes into effect. And, as has happened in other countries with abortion bans, poor women will be hit hardest of all - the rich can usually afford to go elsewhere.\n\nThere is no reason to respect the legitimacy of this kind of political decision, in which those in power show no sign of having listened to the people they're deciding on behalf of. Though plenty in the pro-life movement are female , the people who will be most affected are nowhere in the debate. Unfortunately, structural problems with the US government mean that we're heading for an even more undemocratic future.\n\nWhite men have never made up the majority of the US population, and yet from the country's beginnings they have made up most of its political decision-makers. The constitution itself is an outrageously undemocratic document. People today are bound by a set of procedural rules that were made without the input of women, African Americans or native people. The framers quite deliberately constructed a system that would prevent what they called \"tyranny of the majority\" but what is more accurately called \"popular democracy\".\n\nThat set of rules has been very effective at keeping the American populace from exercising power. James Madison was explicit about the function of the United States Senate - it was \"to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority\". Indeed, that's precisely what it does. As Jamelle Bouie points out , the Senate has \"an affluent membership composed mostly of white men, who are about 30% of the population but hold 71 of the seats\" out of 100. Though popular opinion may overwhelmingly favor universal healthcare and more progressive taxation, these policies are said to be \"politically impossible\" because the millionaires who populate Congress do not favor them.\n\nWe hear a lot about how the electoral college, the US supreme court and gerrymandered districts are undermining democratic rule. But it's worth reflecting on just how deep the disenfranchisement really is. The supreme court is the highest branch of government, in that it can overturn the decisions of the other two branches. It consists of just nine people, all of whom went to Harvard or Yale and two-thirds of whom are men. Ian Samuel has pointed out the remarkable fact that, thanks to the way the Senate is structured, the senators who voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the court represent 38 million fewer people than the senators who voted against him.\n\nThe implications here are extreme. It simply doesn't matter where the people of the US stand on union dues, campaign finance reform, or abortion. What matters is the opinion of nine elites, in many cases appointed by presidents who did not win the popular vote. A constitution written by slaveholders is being interpreted by a tiny room full of elites who have been given no meaningful popular approval. When you step back and look at the situation objectively, it's utterly farcical to call the US government democratic.\n\nThe electoral college is, of course, its own problem. It's difficult to know how elections would have gone in its absence - after all, people would campaign differently if success were measured differently. But there is something perverse and troubling about a system in which the person who gets the most votes loses the election.\n\nThings are only going to get worse. The good news is that America is becoming an ever-more-diverse and in many ways more progressive country. By 2045 the US will lose its white majority , and despite Trump's efforts to whip the country into a xenophobic frenzy, the American people are becoming steadily more sympathetic to immigrants. Most young people identify as socialists instead of capitalists, and on the whole people want a far more progressive set of national policies on economics, foreign policy and immigration than are currently being practiced.\n\nBut demographic changes do not automatically change the power structure, and it's likely that we'll see a conservative white minority taking extreme steps to cling to power in the coming decades. That's why you see new voter ID laws and resistance to restoring voting rights to felons who have served their sentence. That's why state legislatures draw districts in a way that ensures the party that gets the most votes doesn't necessarily get the most seats.\n\nThe undemocratic nature of our institutions means that conservatives might well succeed in overriding popular sentiment for many years to come. If, God forbid, Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Stephen Breyer left the supreme court during Trump's term in office, the radical right would be all but assured to have complete veto power over US policy for the next several decades. It's very hard to undo gerrymandered districts or loosen campaign finance laws if the whole point of these measures is to keep the left out of power.\n\nIt's hard to say where all of this will lead. If the court pushes too far in overturning democratic measures it will lose legitimacy and schemes like \" court-packing \" will come to seem more like necessary correctives than revolutionary disruptions. In a country whose electoral system still somewhat functions, there is only so much a government can do to keep people from exercising their right to rule, without resorting to totalitarian measures.\n\nBut that's precisely why we may see increasingly totalitarian measures, as the gap between the will of the people and the interests of the small minority in charge continues to widen. History's bloody revolutions show us what happens when this gap becomes too large, and the government entirely ceases to effectively represent the governed. Conservatives will continue to push unpopular policies on an unwilling United States. But it's unclear how long people will accept having decisions made for them by a few dozen rich white men.\n\nNathan Robinson is the editor of Current Affairs"

      "text": "Coldplay: only the latest pop stars to misrepresent India as an exotic playground\n\nThe legacy of colonial representation in music videos from Major Lazer, Iggy Azalea and now Coldplay extends beyond the cultural appropriation debate\n\nWithin hours of releasing their new music video Hymn for the Weekend , Coldplay reignited the debate on cultural appropriation that for years has pestered ignorant white people everywhere. Shot in India, the video features the British band performing in Mumbai during the Holi festival while frontman Chris Martin rides in a rickshaw and goes to the cinema to watch a Bollywood film starring Beyoncé.\n\nSome were quick to call out Beyoncé for wearing Indian clothes and jewelry while others found nothing offensive about the video. So let's just settle this and move on: if cultural appropriation means that a privileged group adopts the symbols and practices of a marginalized one for profit or social capital, then yes, Coldplay's video is committing cultural appropriation.\n\nBut it's also more than that. Director Ben Mor sprayed the \"essence of incredible India\" onto his video, a diluted perfume invented by white, western creatives whenever they want some Indian inspiration. Under the western gaze, India is a lush, exotic land filled with dingy slums inhabited by pious, levitating holy men and lanky brown-skinned children who are always throwing colored powders at each other. This idealized India obscures the realities of a complex nation in favor of reductive tropes originally intended to preserve western hegemony. Coldplay's myopic construction of India has been part of western representation since the colonial era, but in the past few years, the music industry has embraced it to make their videos more interesting.\n\nThe Hymn for the Weekend video cannot be brushed off as \"just a video\" - it is part of a system of representation that shapes how the west understands and engages with the world. The cultural theorist Stuart Hall wrote extensively about how representations become meaningful - and powerful - in relation to each other and to similar images throughout history. These tropes of colors and spirituality and poverty have been reproduced so often by western media to the point that they've become inherent to what India means in our collective imaginations. The vestiges of orientalism , an ideology originally deployed to justify and reinforce imperialist ambitions, now maintain a colonial logic that privileges the west over the rest.\n\nMartin and his band are portrayed as dynamic, modern westerners who entrance the city with their formulaic pop song. They are not treated as outsiders but instead are integrated, if not put in the center, of the locals' festivities. There is no suspicion, no resistance, and Coldplay partakes in the spectacle of daily life and ritual as if they're entitled to do so. The orientalist dichotomies of modern/primitive, light/dark, rich/poor may not be as overt as they once were in colonial imagery, but these binaries still influence the way we think of the \"other\".\n\nPerhaps the most insidious aspect of western media's infatuation with India is the lack of social and political context, namely in the careless conflation of India with Hinduism. Holy men in saffron robes, stone idols covered in garlands and multi-limbed gods have come to represent a whole country that is currently experiencing internal conflict stemming from Hindu nationalism . Those in power seek to define India's politics and culture based on upper-caste Hindu doctrines that have been used to sanction violence against non-Hindus and people of lower castes. The link may seem tenuous, but the reproduction of benign, ahistorical Hindu images erases not only the multiplicity of religious practices, but stifles critical thinking about India's social and political climate. Coldplay's video romanticizes Hinduism to further exoticize India as a westerners' paradise unsullied by harsh realities.\n\nNow let's talk about Beyoncé, who, along with Bollywood actor Sonam Kapoor , represents the desirable exotic woman. \"Rani\" Bey plays an alluring Bollywood star, wearing indigenous clothing and gesturing her henna-painted hands in front of a psychedelic background. I've purposely downplayed her involvement in the cultural appropriation debate for a reason. While Beyoncé's appearance makes her complicit, her role in the video is little more than being an object to ogle. A black woman wearing South Asian markers of femininity must be distinguished from how white appropriation operates not only because of the politics of appropriation between people of color , but also the shared (and little discussed) history of cultural exchange between Africa and South Asia . Beyoncé and Kapoor, who does a two-second cameo as a nameless Eurocentric beauty, are seductive props rather than colonial propagators. But this doesn't mean they are relieved of the responsibility to call out a legacy of representation that has recently become very profitable for the music industry.\n\nColdplay is just the latest popular band to shoot a music video that invokes India. In Major Lazer and DJ Snake's video for Lean On, the electronic producers perform Bollywood-esque choreography in a palace as Danish singer MØ thrusts her pelvis awkwardly surrounded by dancing brown women. The video is the 15th most watched on YouTube with more than 1bn views. Diplo of Major Lazer has called India \" some kind of special creature with one foot in history and one firmly in the future \" with beauty that \"humbled\" him - and made him a lot of money.\n\nThen there's Iggy Azalea's Bounce, inspired by her mother's Indian friend's wedding . The Australian rapper looks like she's wearing an \"Indian woman\" Halloween costume in the jarring video that splices shots of a raucous party and an outdoor puja with the stoic faces of Indian men and children. And just when you think you're done cringing, Azalea rides around Mumbai on an elephant dressed as a Hindu goddess with her ornate crown and gold bodysuit. Azalea drew accusations of cultural appropriation around the same time that Selena Gomez was criticized for wearing a bindi during her live performances of Come and Get It . But despite the backlash, both songs were still very commercially successful.\n\nThese music videos are perpetuating hackneyed fantasies of India as an exotic playground for rich white people to explore and exploit for cultural capital and economic gain. This is about more than calling out cultural appropriation when a white girl is wearing a bindi at the club - representations conceived through a white, western lens wield real power to reinforce the racial and colonial logics that undergird the way we think about non-western people, places and cultures. This is why the growing movement of South Asian self-representation is so vital. Mostly through social media, South Asian artists, activists and scholars are voicing their politics and lived experiences as a challenge enduring stereotypes. The time has finally come for Coldplay and other western artists to fall back and let us take it from here."

      "text": "Checking out early: who is going to die in this season of The White Lotus?\n\nThe third season of Mike White's delicious resort-set comedy drama has teased yet another murder but we don't yet know the whos or the whys\n\nA fter a characteristically slow start, we are now halfway through this year's season of The White Lotus . From what we know of the last two seasons, this means that things are about to get very crazy very quickly. To use season one as a way marker, we are now approximately the runtime of The Brutalist away from watching someone perform the equivalent of a suitcase poop.\n\nMore than previous runs, however, a number of mysteries still hang over almost every White Lotus character this year. We know that there's a shooting. We know that there's a body. At this point, almost every character could be either one of them. It's time to theorise wildly.\n\nPoor Belinda. In season one she had her dreams snatched away by Jennifer Coolidge's obliviously privileged whims, and now her holiday of a lifetime has turned into a full-blown detective novel. She's on to Greg/Gary, and they're both trapped in a death spiral of furiously Googling each other. Greg is quickly emerging as the throughline to all three seasons here, and he has a good line in outright menace. It isn't beyond the realms of possibility that he gets to Belinda before she can alert the authorities, which would be especially tragic since her son will arrive at the resort just as the shooting starts. Then again, Natasha Rothwell is the MVP of the entire White Lotus. Plus, as anyone who has seen Sonic the Hedgehog 2 will attest, there is nobody better at deranged fury than her. Perhaps Mike White saw this, wanted some of it for himself, and chose to end the season with Belinda on the rampage.\n\nLikelihood : If Mike White has his head screwed on, he'll keep Belinda around for years to come, so let's hope this is slim. 3/10\n\nOne's a Trump supporter, one's an alcoholic and none of them are quite as good at hiding their mutual animosity behind masks of rictus joy as they think. This has to end badly. Jaclyn, Laurie and Kate are perhaps the most insufferable characters around this year (which is really saying something) and every passing episode feels more and more like a powder keg waiting to go off. Even rich white woman condescension - the universe's most powerful form of condescension - has a breaking point. More than anything, though, this week's scene of the trio being set upon by dozens of water pistols felt like foreshadowing. Surely they can't survive the finale.\n\nLikelihood: Yes they're awful, but three women squabbling to death isn't really White's style. Chances are he'll just return them safely to their terrible pre-existing lives. 4/10\n\nYou cannot call a character Saxon, and have him be this much of a dick, unless there's going to be a hefty payoff down the line. Saxon is an archetype that The White Lotus has returned to again and again - too arrogant, too entitled, too macho, too altogether American - and this never ends well. If we're talking potential murderers, then it's hard to look beyond the man who openly masturbated in full view of his sexually confused brother. Plus, remember how angrily he reacted when he couldn't find a blender in his room? Imagine how nuts he'll go when he realises that his dad is broke. Similarly, if you had to shoot anyone on this show, chances are it'd also be Saxon, because of course you would.\n\nLikelihood: White does like to punish this specific type of character - in season one the most entitled white guy accidentally murdered someone, and in the second his wife started an affair with Will Sharpe - so Saxon won't leave the series unharmed. But a gun rampage does seem a little on the nose. 6/10\n\nSimilarly, you don't cast an actor like Walton Goggins unless you have something particularly meaty for him to chew on. So far his character Rick has been wound tighter than everyone else put together, angrily refusing to tell anyone anything about himself, unless it has something to do with his open hostility for the husband of the resort's owner and/or is an opportunity for him to be irresponsible with snakes. At times, Rick feels like he's been beamed in from another (potentially worse) project; maybe a Jason Statham potboiler about a taciturn man hellbent on revenge for the death of his father. This season is still playing its cards close to its chest, but this one seems destined for bloodshed.\n\nLikelihood: High. However, The White Lotus isn't the sort of show that likes to telegraph its endings this early and this clearly, so let's see. 7/10\n\nThe first season of The White Lotus was the story of a very together man who elaborately unspooled and wound up dead. So far, Tim is following this plot beat for beat. We're only four episodes in, and he's gone from uptight businessman to a broke, fitfully naked crook who is off his beans on his wife's lorazepam, apparently suicidal and potentially now in possession of a stolen gun. How much crazier is his storyline going to get before he definitely ends up as a corpse? Here's hoping a lot.\n\nLikelihood: Come on, this is The White Lotus by numbers. 9/10"

The title means crazily or extremely rich. Jon M Chu's highly entertaining and outrageously over-the-top Cinderella soap opera, adapted by Adele Lim and Peter Chiarelli from the Kevin Kwan bestseller, is about a Chinese-American economics professor in New York called Rachel, fluent in both Putonghua and English, whose younger Singaporean boyfriend, Nick, invites her back to his country for a big family wedding. Only once Rachel finds herself in the plane's first-class section does it start dawning on her that Nick is heir to the most staggeringly gigantic fortune in Asia. (Wait. Did it never occur to this smart analytical thinker to type his name into Google? And why is Nick doing something so low-rent as flying commercial? Well, no matter.) When they arrive in Singapore, her astonishment and disorientation escalate at the sight of the unfeasibly lavish airport. \"JFK just smells of salmonella and despair,\" she mumbles. Soon the dizzying skyline of Singapore presents itself, with the colossal Marina Bay Sands hotel looming up like a postmodern Stonehenge, and evidently much more to the point than the boring old Raffles.\n\nRachel is played by the elegant and luminous Constance Wu , and the Malaysian star Henry Golding is self-effacing zillionaire Nick; amusingly, the original novel suggested that Nick should resemble the Japanese-Taiwanese actor Takeshi Kaneshiro, star of many Wong Kar-wai films, but now presumably too old for the part. And Michelle Yeoh gives a showstopping performance as Nick's scary mother Eleanor, who is enigmatically displeased at the sight of this American outsider's claws in her son.\n\nCould it be that the displays of mind-bendingly conspicuous wealth on display at the weekend's lavish parties are being deployed by Eleanor and other disapproving family members to intimidate Rachel, to scare her away? Finally, Rachel will face off with Eleanor over the mahjong table, a contest with the icy seriousness of the chess match in The Seventh Seal .\n\nCrazy Rich Asians isn't big on subtlety and wants to overturn just one cliche: that rich people are bad. But, with a mostly all-Asian cast, it's a corrective to the Hollywood racism that decrees Asian characters can only be shown fleetingly, if at all, and then mostly in subservient roles. Marvel's Black Panther did something similar with black characters, in a similarly unpretentious way. And the Crazy Rich Asians here do have a superpower, the same superpower as Bruce Wayne: they are crazy rich! There's a cheerful honesty in the title. Maybe Nancy Meyers comedies should all be renamed Crazy Rich White People. Moreover, white America can relax: the only racists on display here are Brits. A haughty London hotel manager presumes to insult Eleanor. As Julia Roberts says in Pretty Woman: big mistake, big, huge.\n\nGemma Chan has the rather thankless role of Nick's serene fashion-plate cousin Astrid, but the scene is stolen by the funny supporting roles. Awkwafina is a highly enjoyable turn as Peik Lin Goh, Rachel's sarky college contemporary who now also lives with her comedy extended family in Singapore: there are some big laughs from Ken Jeong as the paterfamilias, Wye Mun Goh, who mocks Rachel's provincial fashion sense and her red dress. (\"I thought red was lucky!\" \"Yeah, if you're an envelope!\") Ronny Chieng is Nick's pompous cousin Eddie, and Nico Santos is the witty fashion connoisseur Oliver, who describes himself as the \"rainbow sheep\" of the family. The 91-year-old Lisa Lu has style and presence as Nick's revered grandmother, who takes a shine to Rachel. \"The shape of your nose is auspicious,\" she tells her, gnomically. All this intrigue ends inconclusively, even abruptly, with every sign of a sequel in prospect.\n\nPerhaps inevitably, the progressive claim for Crazy Rich Asians has been countered against it, with complaints that it ignores Indian and Malay Singaporeans, that it naively reimagines Singapore as a luxury resort, and that it is another orientalist fantasy. This last accusation reminded me of Edward Said , the great anatomiser of orientalism, once describing Singapore as \"the Israel of Asia\" - and he did not intend that comparison politely. All these things are fair comment, but fail to account for the qualifying or extenuating factor of it being a fiction - and a funny and extravagant one.\n\nI would add that the issue of erasing Asians from the movie screen has been a problem if you rigidly stick to Hollywood and have no interest at all in Asian movies. Perhaps this good-natured and spectacular comedy will be a jumping-off point."

      "text": "Coldplay: only the latest pop stars to misrepresent India as an exotic playground\n\nThe legacy of colonial representation in music videos from Major Lazer, Iggy Azalea and now Coldplay extends beyond the cultural appropriation debate\n\nWithin hours of releasing their new music video Hymn for the Weekend , Coldplay reignited the debate on cultural appropriation that for years has pestered ignorant white people everywhere. Shot in India, the video features the British band performing in Mumbai during the Holi festival while frontman Chris Martin rides in a rickshaw and goes to the cinema to watch a Bollywood film starring Beyoncé.\n\nSome were quick to call out Beyoncé for wearing Indian clothes and jewelry while others found nothing offensive about the video. So let's just settle this and move on: if cultural appropriation means that a privileged group adopts the symbols and practices of a marginalized one for profit or social capital, then yes, Coldplay's video is committing cultural appropriation.\n\nBut it's also more than that. Director Ben Mor sprayed the \"essence of incredible India\" onto his video, a diluted perfume invented by white, western creatives whenever they want some Indian inspiration. Under the western gaze, India is a lush, exotic land filled with dingy slums inhabited by pious, levitating holy men and lanky brown-skinned children who are always throwing colored powders at each other. This idealized India obscures the realities of a complex nation in favor of reductive tropes originally intended to preserve western hegemony. Coldplay's myopic construction of India has been part of western representation since the colonial era, but in the past few years, the music industry has embraced it to make their videos more interesting.\n\nThe Hymn for the Weekend video cannot be brushed off as \"just a video\" - it is part of a system of representation that shapes how the west understands and engages with the world. The cultural theorist Stuart Hall wrote extensively about how representations become meaningful - and powerful - in relation to each other and to similar images throughout history. These tropes of colors and spirituality and poverty have been reproduced so often by western media to the point that they've become inherent to what India means in our collective imaginations. The vestiges of orientalism , an ideology originally deployed to justify and reinforce imperialist ambitions, now maintain a colonial logic that privileges the west over the rest.\n\nMartin and his band are portrayed as dynamic, modern westerners who entrance the city with their formulaic pop song. They are not treated as outsiders but instead are integrated, if not put in the center, of the locals' festivities. There is no suspicion, no resistance, and Coldplay partakes in the spectacle of daily life and ritual as if they're entitled to do so. The orientalist dichotomies of modern/primitive, light/dark, rich/poor may not be as overt as they once were in colonial imagery, but these binaries still influence the way we think of the \"other\".\n\nPerhaps the most insidious aspect of western media's infatuation with India is the lack of social and political context, namely in the careless conflation of India with Hinduism. Holy men in saffron robes, stone idols covered in garlands and multi-limbed gods have come to represent a whole country that is currently experiencing internal conflict stemming from Hindu nationalism . Those in power seek to define India's politics and culture based on upper-caste Hindu doctrines that have been used to sanction violence against non-Hindus and people of lower castes. The link may seem tenuous, but the reproduction of benign, ahistorical Hindu images erases not only the multiplicity of religious practices, but stifles critical thinking about India's social and political climate. Coldplay's video romanticizes Hinduism to further exoticize India as a westerners' paradise unsullied by harsh realities.\n\nNow let's talk about Beyoncé, who, along with Bollywood actor Sonam Kapoor , represents the desirable exotic woman. \"Rani\" Bey plays an alluring Bollywood star, wearing indigenous clothing and gesturing her henna-painted hands in front of a psychedelic background. I've purposely downplayed her involvement in the cultural appropriation debate for a reason. While Beyoncé's appearance makes her complicit, her role in the video is little more than being an object to ogle. A black woman wearing South Asian markers of femininity must be distinguished from how white appropriation operates not only because of the politics of appropriation between people of color , but also the shared (and little discussed) history of cultural exchange between Africa and South Asia . Beyoncé and Kapoor, who does a two-second cameo as a nameless Eurocentric beauty, are seductive props rather than colonial propagators. But this doesn't mean they are relieved of the responsibility to call out a legacy of representation that has recently become very profitable for the music industry.\n\nColdplay is just the latest popular band to shoot a music video that invokes India. In Major Lazer and DJ Snake's video for Lean On, the electronic producers perform Bollywood-esque choreography in a palace as Danish singer MØ thrusts her pelvis awkwardly surrounded by dancing brown women. The video is the 15th most watched on YouTube with more than 1bn views. Diplo of Major Lazer has called India \" some kind of special creature with one foot in history and one firmly in the future \" with beauty that \"humbled\" him - and made him a lot of money.\n\nThen there's Iggy Azalea's Bounce, inspired by her mother's Indian friend's wedding . The Australian rapper looks like she's wearing an \"Indian woman\" Halloween costume in the jarring video that splices shots of a raucous party and an outdoor puja with the stoic faces of Indian men and children. And just when you think you're done cringing, Azalea rides around Mumbai on an elephant dressed as a Hindu goddess with her ornate crown and gold bodysuit. Azalea drew accusations of cultural appropriation around the same time that Selena Gomez was criticized for wearing a bindi during her live performances of Come and Get It . But despite the backlash, both songs were still very commercially successful.\n\nThese music videos are perpetuating hackneyed fantasies of India as an exotic playground for rich white people to explore and exploit for cultural capital and economic gain. This is about more than calling out cultural appropriation when a white girl is wearing a bindi at the club - representations conceived through a white, western lens wield real power to reinforce the racial and colonial logics that undergird the way we think about non-western people, places and cultures. This is why the growing movement of South Asian self-representation is so vital. Mostly through social media, South Asian artists, activists and scholars are voicing their politics and lived experiences as a challenge enduring stereotypes. The time has finally come for Coldplay and other western artists to fall back and let us take it from here."

      "text": "Just what the NFL needs: another rich, white owner who boasts about his testicles\n\nDavid Tepper may have taken on Donald Trump publicly, but he doesn't appear too different from the fraternity that already controls the league\n\nL ast winter, Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson embarrassed the NFL. According to reports by Sports Illustrated , Richardson did much more than that, as the publication unearthed evidence of settlements to bury sexual harassment claims and an allegation of a racial slur aimed at an African American employee. It was a devastating example of problems that women and black people in the sports world have to deal with on a daily basis. But for the other 31 NFL owners, it was a major public relations hit that implicated the league in the wrongs the #MeToo movement has worked to expose. Within 24 hours, Richardson announced he was selling his team (to date, Richardson has not publicly commented on the allegations).\n\nFive months later, Richardson has a buyer for the Panthers. The lucky man is hedge fund manager David Tepper, who will pay Richardson $2.2bn for the rights to the team. Tepper, on the surface, seems like the ideal candidate to distract from the allegations surrounding Richardson, which the NFL has been investigating without much headway since December. Tepper was outspoken against Donald Trump during the presidential campaign, saying, among other things that \"Trump masquerades as an angel of light, but he is the father of lies.\"\n\nTepper's addition to the ranks of NFL ownership has already been framed by some, including Sports Illustrated , as adding to the league's resistance to Trump, who has been an outspoken critic of Colin Kaepernick and other NFL players who have protested police brutality and racial inequality in the justice system. Perhaps more importantly, as an admitted sexual assailant residing in the White House, Trump is perhaps the ultimate symbol of toxic masculinity.\n\nTepper may be less obviously odious than Richardson. But it is disingenuous to frame Tepper as a voice for equality and change simply because he thinks Trump is a liar, or because he voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nIf anything, some of Tepper's workplace mannerisms - detailed in a 2010 New York magazine profile - sound eerily reminiscent of the overbearing, dominating behavior Richardson routinely used against his employees. At Appaloosa, his almost entirely male-staffed hedge fund, Tepper kept a pair of brass testicles on his desk affixed to a plaque reading \"THE MOST VALUABLE SET OF ALL TIME\". One former employee said he would keep a set of breast implants (a gift from a client that manufactured them) and throw them around his office. Another employee described Tepper as \"an asshole, to say the least.\" This employee said, \"I had stuff thrown at me. He can be a nice guy off the desk, in the kitchen or walking to the car. It's almost like Jekyll and Hyde, you didn't know any given day who was going to walk through the door.\" As a youth softball coach, Tepper was known for getting so angry that his screams could be heard from a block down.\n\nParticularly in a competitive, boys club-style workplace like the NFL or a hedge fund, this kind of behavior from an executive is treated as a fact of life or a running office joke. That's also how NFL owners responded to the accusations against Richardson, who would routinely comment on women's backsides on \"Jeans Day\" and leave notes for female employees with his personal requests regarding their grooming habits. Bob McNair, the Houston Texans owner, said at the NFL's annual meetings , \"Some of the comments he might have made could have been made jokingly and misunderstood. I'm sure he didn't mean to offend anybody.\"\n\nIt's impossible to ignore that Tepper is yet another older rich white guy joining an ownership club primarily made up of older rich, white guys. Tepper is from a different generation - he grew up middle class in Pittsburgh before rising to the top of the investment world - but he differs from many NFL owners primarily in style, not substance. It doesn't matter if he checks the right box on the ballot or says the right words in front of a camera if his actions - like screaming and throwing things at his employees - prove that he sees certain people as lesser than others.\n\nThat problem, of course, would not necessarily be solved simply by a minority or a woman buying the team. But we shouldn't ignore the plea of the woman, a former Panthers employee, who spoke out to Sports Illustrated about Richardson's behavior and the many people who enabled it in a series of open letters published in late April. In the final letter, the unnamed employee addresses the future owner of the Panthers, then unknown:\n\n\"I cannot wait for you to take over the team so I can be a Carolina Panthers fan again. I hope you are female and/or African American, but regardless, please respect the power that comes with your new position. Don't use it to intimidate or oppress people. Actually, be proactive and use it to mandate equality.\"\n\nTepper is, glaringly, neither female nor African American. Perhaps there is a chance he can be the person the anonymous Panthers employee wants him to be. Perhaps the brass balls and the aggressive workplace behavior are just quirks of Tepper's personality and not a sign of something deeper. The New York profile was, after all, written eight years ago and perhaps Tepper, as he says in the profile, is \"kinder and gentler\" than he once was.\n\nRichardson was highly respected among NFL owners, and judging by McNair's comments, the claims that he was a harasser and all-around creep in the workplace hasn't changed that opinion. The fact that Tepper is willing to speak out against Donald Trump does not mitigate the fact that the NFL owners are still mostly a fraternity of men who get off on their own power, whether they are lording it over their players or their employees or the women in all aspects of their lives. The only reason Richardson is getting pushed out is because the wrong news got out at the wrong time. Richardson is merely part of the NFL's culture. Replacing him with another billionaire, no matter how centrist, will neither fix the deep rot at the league's core nor the problems in the workplace for the women and minorities it employs."

      "text": "Rich white men rule America. How much longer will we tolerate that?\n\nMinority rule has always been a feature of American democracy. These days, however, it is getting worse\n\nT he core democratic principle is that people should have a meaningful say in political decisions that affect their lives. In Alabama, we've just seen what the opposite of democracy looks like: 25 white male Republicans in the state senate were able to ban almost all abortion in the state . The consequences of that decision fall exclusively on women, who will be forced to carry all pregnancies to term if the law comes into effect. And, as has happened in other countries with abortion bans, poor women will be hit hardest of all - the rich can usually afford to go elsewhere.\n\nThere is no reason to respect the legitimacy of this kind of political decision, in which those in power show no sign of having listened to the people they're deciding on behalf of. Though plenty in the pro-life movement are female , the people who will be most affected are nowhere in the debate. Unfortunately, structural problems with the US government mean that we're heading for an even more undemocratic future.\n\nWhite men have never made up the majority of the US population, and yet from the country's beginnings they have made up most of its political decision-makers. The constitution itself is an outrageously undemocratic document. People today are bound by a set of procedural rules that were made without the input of women, African Americans or native people. The framers quite deliberately constructed a system that would prevent what they called \"tyranny of the majority\" but what is more accurately called \"popular democracy\".\n\nThat set of rules has been very effective at keeping the American populace from exercising power. James Madison was explicit about the function of the United States Senate - it was \"to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority\". Indeed, that's precisely what it does. As Jamelle Bouie points out , the Senate has \"an affluent membership composed mostly of white men, who are about 30% of the population but hold 71 of the seats\" out of 100. Though popular opinion may overwhelmingly favor universal healthcare and more progressive taxation, these policies are said to be \"politically impossible\" because the millionaires who populate Congress do not favor them.\n\nWe hear a lot about how the electoral college, the US supreme court and gerrymandered districts are undermining democratic rule. But it's worth reflecting on just how deep the disenfranchisement really is. The supreme court is the highest branch of government, in that it can overturn the decisions of the other two branches. It consists of just nine people, all of whom went to Harvard or Yale and two-thirds of whom are men. Ian Samuel has pointed out the remarkable fact that, thanks to the way the Senate is structured, the senators who voted to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the court represent 38 million fewer people than the senators who voted against him.\n\nThe implications here are extreme. It simply doesn't matter where the people of the US stand on union dues, campaign finance reform, or abortion. What matters is the opinion of nine elites, in many cases appointed by presidents who did not win the popular vote. A constitution written by slaveholders is being interpreted by a tiny room full of elites who have been given no meaningful popular approval. When you step back and look at the situation objectively, it's utterly farcical to call the US government democratic.\n\nThe electoral college is, of course, its own problem. It's difficult to know how elections would have gone in its absence - after all, people would campaign differently if success were measured differently. But there is something perverse and troubling about a system in which the person who gets the most votes loses the election.\n\nThings are only going to get worse. The good news is that America is becoming an ever-more-diverse and in many ways more progressive country. By 2045 the US will lose its white majority , and despite Trump's efforts to whip the country into a xenophobic frenzy, the American people are becoming steadily more sympathetic to immigrants. Most young people identify as socialists instead of capitalists, and on the whole people want a far more progressive set of national policies on economics, foreign policy and immigration than are currently being practiced.\n\nBut demographic changes do not automatically change the power structure, and it's likely that we'll see a conservative white minority taking extreme steps to cling to power in the coming decades. That's why you see new voter ID laws and resistance to restoring voting rights to felons who have served their sentence. That's why state legislatures draw districts in a way that ensures the party that gets the most votes doesn't necessarily get the most seats.\n\nThe undemocratic nature of our institutions means that conservatives might well succeed in overriding popular sentiment for many years to come. If, God forbid, Ruth Bader Ginsburg or Stephen Breyer left the supreme court during Trump's term in office, the radical right would be all but assured to have complete veto power over US policy for the next several decades. It's very hard to undo gerrymandered districts or loosen campaign finance laws if the whole point of these measures is to keep the left out of power.\n\nIt's hard to say where all of this will lead. If the court pushes too far in overturning democratic measures it will lose legitimacy and schemes like \" court-packing \" will come to seem more like necessary correctives than revolutionary disruptions. In a country whose electoral system still somewhat functions, there is only so much a government can do to keep people from exercising their right to rule, without resorting to totalitarian measures.\n\nBut that's precisely why we may see increasingly totalitarian measures, as the gap between the will of the people and the interests of the small minority in charge continues to widen. History's bloody revolutions show us what happens when this gap becomes too large, and the government entirely ceases to effectively represent the governed. Conservatives will continue to push unpopular policies on an unwilling United States. But it's unclear how long people will accept having decisions made for them by a few dozen rich white men.\n\nNathan Robinson is the editor of Current Affairs"

      "text": "The Gospel according to Kesha: Queer Forgiveness in \"Praying\"\n\nPastor, First Presbyterian Church in Bordentown, NJ\n\nFirst, a confession: I have long disliked Kesha's work. Call me a bad gay, but \"TiK ToK\" and \"Crazy Kids\" never did it for me. Catchy as her music was, the lyrics felt irredeemably vacuous, and I walked away from just about every song with a whiff of rich white girl entitlement. For years, I have rolled my eyes at the mere mention of her name.\n\nThen I heard \"Praying.\"\n\nDropped on July 6, it's the first original song that the pop star has released in five years-and in order to properly appreciate it, you have to know why it's been so long. Beginning in 2013, Kesha became embroiled in a legal dispute with her former producer, Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald, who signed her to his label (Kemosabe Records) over a decade ago. In 2014, after checking herself into rehab, Kesha sued Dr. Luke for alleged sexual assault and battery, gender violence, emotional abuse, and more. Just last year, the dispute came to a disturbing end when the New York Supreme Court rejected all of Kesha's claims . Addressed both to Dr. Luke and to God, \"Praying\" is a response to the pain that Kesha has endured in recent years.\n\nLike much of her past output, this new song and the accompanying music video contain plenty of queer imagery, with colors and rainbows in abundance. Much less characteristic for the openly bisexual artist, \"Praying\" is replete with religious language and symbolism-crosses, Bible verses, and numerous other references to Christian texts and traditions. Far from conflicting with each other, these two themes of queerness and Christianity are variously connected in the song and video (for example, a rainbow-colored cross with the words \"Love\" and \"Universal\" written on it). But the connection runs much deeper than this overt symbolism, I would argue. Based on my interpretation of the song, \"Praying\" subtly fuses queerness and Christianity in Kesha's posture towards her oppressor-a praying posture, perhaps even a forgiving posture. Both as a queer message and as a Christian message, it packs quite the punch.\n\nThe opening shot of the music video shows Kesha lying down in a long wooden box underneath a neon red cross. She is flanked by two men wearing business suits and lifelike pig's heads, looking down on and drooling over her motionless body. The box in which she lies appears to be part-bed, part-coffin, part-trough-and thus, part-manger. Before singing, Kesha speaks a modernized psalm of lament: \"Why have I been abandoned by everyone and everything I've ever known? ... What is the lesson? What is the point? God, give me a sign, or I have to give up. I can't do this anymore. Please just let me die.\"\n\nThe gravity and intensity continue throughout the song: glimpses of Kesha shipwrecked, trapped in fishing nets, praying and screaming through tears of darkened blood underneath the same neon red cross. Meanwhile, the audience witnesses a near-constant panoply of bright rainbow colors-a seeming dissonance that evokes queerness's time-honored tradition of parading through its suffering. (Christianity has its own parallel of this tradition, by the way: proclaiming victory through a crucifixion.)\n\nThe most striking form that queerness takes in \"Praying,\" though, is not in colors or rainbows, but in the words of the song's chorus:\n\nIf we understand queerness as (among other things) subversive engagement with binary systems, then this chorus is rightly called \"queer,\" in that it works to undermine a common moral binary: good things should happen to good people, and bad things should happen to bad people. This is one of those binaries that relatively few people want to disrupt-and for good reason.\n\nBut the chorus of \"Praying\" does precisely that. It pronounces hope that the bad people will eventually heal, flourish, find peace. Rather than wishing for their deserved damnation, the song wishes them undeserved blessing. This is, in fact, one way of defining forgiveness: desiring good things for people who have done bad things. And by this definition, forgiveness is profoundly queer.\n\nIt is not a forgiveness that downplays abuse, as Kesha is forthright in naming and revealing the severity of her pain. It is not a forgiveness that overlooks injustice, as the song clearly indicts Kesha's abuser and never revokes or reduces this indictment. It is not a forgiveness that pressures the survivor into a superficial reconciliation, as the businessmen never take off their pig heads, and there is no hint that the survivor might make friends with the swine. Lastly, it is not a forgiveness that lets someone off the hook for their evil actions, as Kesha clearly conveys that her abuser must repent, that his soul must change, that he must fall on his knees. Only then, when he has truly repented, will he be able to find peace-a peace that Kesha earnestly prays for him to find.\n\nNot only is forgiveness thus understood profoundly queer; it is also profoundly Christian. Jesus famously exhorted his audiences to pray for those who persecute them, and when he himself was crucified, he asked that God would forgive those who mocked, tortured, and killed him. In \"Praying,\" Kesha steps into this queer piety of Christ, symbolized by her crown of thorns and by walking on water.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "'Farm-To-Table' Shouldn't Only Be For Rich White People\n\nOn Assignment For HuffPost\n\nCarlo Petrini's Slow Food and Alice Waters' Chez Panisse are often credited as the originators of the farm-to-table movement in America. Some of the most notable names who have written about and championed it are Wendell Berry , Michael Pollan , Dan Barber , Wes Jackson and Barbara Kingsolver . They've all done significant work to advance the idea that food sourced directly from farms makes a difference. They've inspired many, myself (a cookbook author) included, and today the term is ubiquitous in restaurants and kitchens across the country.\n\nThey're also all white. That's a problem. It means that the concept and execution of farm-to-table ideas and values are predominately centered on white voices even though so much of the food in this country, from the production of it to the preparation of it, has always and continues to depend on the labor of people of color.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be this way. Farm-to-table, if we reframe it, should be a term that better acknowledges the efforts of everyone in the process. Moreover, it should mean that we acknowledge and work to repair the varied, multigenerational, and systemic forms of oppression that directly impact the millions of people who labor to bring food from farms to tables.\n\nTo start at the farm, know that 96 percent of rural landowners are white . The five largest landowners in America, all white, own more rural land than all black Americans combined . Land ownership, and the support systems to navigate and maintain it, is vital to a more just food system. The more varied the group of people that own land, the more those with power will be aware of and able to address issues that affect everyone who works the land. Initiatives like Black Urban Growers , the lawyer-slash-organizer Jillian Hinshaw , and the interactive map Reparations for Black-Indigenous Farmers are all working to shift the balance.\n\n\"When we say farm-to-table, we often leave out the toil of everyone in the 'to.'\"\n\nAnd what about everyone who works on the farms? In 2017 the annual median income for agricultural workers was $23,730. This number is already staggeringly low, but keep in mind it doesn't account for undocumented workers and it includes a range of jobs with varying incomes. According to a 2010 report by Southern Poverty Law Center , the average personal income for female crop workers was $11,250 (compared with $16,250 for male crop workers). Moreover, the industry is rife with wage theft. In a survey of 51 poultry processing plants, the U.S. Department of Labor found that all of them hadn't paid employees for all of the hours they worked.\n\nAgricultural workers also risk dangerous working conditions, including exposure to pesticides and other toxic chemicals . They, especially immigrant women, also regularly face sexual harassment and abuse at work. In a 2014 study , a farmworker from Salinas, California, made reference to \"the field de calzon (field of panties) because so many supervisors take women there to rape them.\" And if a worker seeks justice, she or he will rarely find that the legal system protects them .\n\nToo often when we say farm-to-table, we leave out the toil of everyone in the \"to.\" The same ugly cocktail of racial, economic, and gender discrimination that takes place on farms is mirrored in food processing factories and restaurant kitchens all over America. Risks for workers relying on tips and minimum-wage salaries to make ends meet range from health and safety hazards at poultry processing plants to rampant sexual harassment. Just look at the names that have made headlines in the past few months. Workplace abuse can also come from the very customers that employees serve .\n\nAnd the tables themselves? They're just as economically inaccessible as the farms the food came from in the first place. The \"farm-to-table\" label often sends clear signals about price points and aesthetics. A quick scroll through the 1.4 million Instagram posts marked #farmtotable are primarily of white people with gardens or at nice restaurants. When we say \"farm-to-table,\" it seems that we are saying the term belongs to wealthy white people with access to tables laden with abundant produce. This means we are leaving out so many and so much.\n\nSo what do we do? How do we dismantle the term and reframe it to be more inclusive and equitable?\n\nPeople's Kitchen Collective , a group in Oakland, California, has devoted the last year to a series called \"From the Farm to the Kitchen to the Table to the Streets,\" working specifically to redefine what farm-to-table can mean . Co-founded by Saqib Keval, Jocelyn Jackson, and Sita Bhaumik, the collective aims to show how we can reframe the phrase to keep the whole journey from farm to table in mind while simultaneously honoring and creating space for people of color at each step. \"We crave spaces that deliberately center our voices and experiences. As people of color, our lives are shaped by displacement, migration, loss of land, and access to resources. In the absence of land, we create space by eating in public,\" reads the organization's website.\n\nI have been personally so inspired by their work that I asked them to contribute to my last book, Feed the Resistance , and to participate in an event for it.\n\nIn April 2017, they hosted a community meal where they asked participants to explore how farming has been a way to create place despite displacement ― how cultivating land means having some ownership over it. In August, they went from the farm to the kitchen and asked participants to share stories of kitchen remedies for illness, trauma, and separation. And in February, they invited people affected by xenophobic immigration policies to come to the table for a meal in remembrance of the signing of the executive order mandating the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. They produced a resource guide to accompany the meal, a way to extend the work past the table.\n\nOn Sunday, their largest meal yet will take place in the West Oakland neighborhood, a way to push farm-to-table from private spaces to a large, very public one. The setting will span a city block and the group will provide a free meal for 500 participants.\n\nPeople's Kitchen Collective recognizes that cooking is one of the surest ways to create and sustain community. And their work shows us how we can make the term less centered on white experiences and more grounded in food justice.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Who Gets Health In Old Age? Rich White People\n\nExploring the American idea since 1857\n\nBy Olga Khazan\n\nIt's often said that Americans are living \" longer, healthier lives ,\" and while that's true overall, white wealthy people are still far more likely to enjoy good health than other demographics in old age. A new research letter published in JAMA Internal Medicine Monday revealed clear racial, income, and educational disparities in the number of senior citizens who experience good health - and the gaps have only widened over time.\n\nRELATED: Genes Don't Cause Racial-Health Disparities, Society Does\n\nFor this report, researchers from the University of Michigan looked at adults older than 65 who reported their health as \"excellent\" or \"very good\" at least twice within one calendar year, between 2000 and 2014. As a whole, seniors were feeling healthier by the end of that time period. However, white people and wealthy people were most likely to consider themselves very healthy. The most highly educated seniors consistently felt healthier than those with less education, and as the study went on, the health of that group only improved. In 2000, 57.4 percent of highly educated seniors considered themselves in very good or excellent health, and by 2014, that number had risen to 63 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the poorest adults, those who never married, those with a high-school degree or less, blacks and Hispanics all saw declines in the number who reported themselves as being in \"excellent\" or \"very good\" health. The finding that older Hispanics are in relatively poor health, and saw declines in health over time, bucks a popular theory in public health known as the \" Hispanic paradox ,\" in which Hispanics have been found to have generally good health and long life expectancies despite their often-difficult life circumstances.\n\n\"The surprising disparities that emerge in this study underscore the fact that health insurance does not always guarantee good health.\"\n\nThe poor health of high-school graduates in this study mirrors earlier studies by Princeton's Angus Deaton and Anne Case , who found an increase in mortality rates among white middle-aged people without high-school diplomas. Although the people in Case and Deaton's studies were slightly younger - 50 to 54 - this study shows what happens to those individuals if they do survive into their 60s.\n\nRELATED: America's Health Segregation Problem\n\nThe surprising disparities that emerge in this study underscore the fact that health insurance does not always guarantee good health. People over 65 are eligible for Medicare, yet some groups are clearly healthier than others. Access to a doctor is essential, but overall health, it seems, is the sum of what happens in a lifetime.\n\nThis story originally appeared on TheAtlantic.com .\n\nMore from The Atlantic: Why Happy People Cheat , The First White President\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

(OISM is eager to collect as much urine as possible, so if you would like to donate a sample of your own, the details are available here .)\n\nBABF appears to exist solely as a vehicle for Washington, D.C., consultant Raynard Jackson, who is African-American. Jackson is quoted on his firm's website stating that \"You have a fundamental right to pursue business interests with the least amount of interference from the government.\" Jackson has elsewhere accused Barack Obama of \"relentless pandering to homosexuals.\"\n\nAt an event in November 2015 at the National Press Club, which cost BABF $13,252.79 for the venue and catering, Jackson said that \"Having well-trained, credible, experienced African-Americans constantly challenging the liberal orthodoxy in the media will create a tectonic shift in the perception of the Republican Party within the Black community.\"\n\nAs of its current FEC filings , BABF has spent a total of $172,424.69, including $38,983.45 in net salary payment, to Jackson for the last five months of 2015. Together with $26,952.55 disbursed for payroll taxes, this indicates Jackson is receiving an annual salary of $155,000. The Super PAC's remaining spending has been mostly for travel, hotels, and food, including about $5,000 at New York's famous Morton's Steakhouse on Fifth Avenue.\n\nThe other donations to BABF consist of:\n\nBABF also listed $3,000 in in-kind \"fundraising consulting\" from Product Placement Services of Birmingham, Alabama - although Product Placement Services for some reason also showed up under disbursements, to the tune of $6,000.\n\nRaynard Jackson did not respond to inquiries via Twitter and the voicemail for the number listed on his consulting firm's website is full.\n\n(Thanks to Derek Willis of ProPublica and Dave Levinthal of Public Integrity, who pointed out Mercer's donations to BABF on Twitter.)\n\nMargot Williams contributed to this report.\n\nTop photo: (L to R) Tony Parker: Damian Dovarganes/AP; Bob Mercer: Andrew Toth/Getty Images; Pete Bowe: youtube.com\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Nonvoters Are Not Privileged. They Are Disproportionately Lower-Income, Nonwhite, and Dissatisfied With the Two Parties.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe media and political class's depiction of abstention as a byproduct of class and racial privilege is a lie.\n\nNot even 24 hours have elapsed since Bernie Sanders announced that he was suspending his presidential run , and already a shaming campaign has been launched against those who are contemplating abstaining from voting due to dissatisfaction with the two major party candidates. The premise invoked for this tactic is that only those who are sufficiently \"privileged\" have the luxury of choosing not to vote - meaning that nonvoters are rich and white and thus largely immune from the harmful consequences of a Trump presidency, which largely fall on the backs of poorer and nonwhite Americans.\n\nThis tactic rests on a caricature: It is designed to suggest that the only people who make a deliberate and conscious choice not to vote due to dissatisfaction are white trust fund leftists whose wealth, status, and privilege immunize them from the consequences of abstention. By contrast, this \"You Must Vote\" campaign insists, those who lack such luxuries - poorer voters and racial minorities - understand that voting is imperative.\n\nThis assertion about the identity and motives of nonvoters is critical not only to try to bully and coerce people into voting by associating nonvoting with rich, white privilege, but also to suppress any recognition of how widespread the dissatisfaction is for both parties and the political system generally among poor and nonwhite citizens.\n\nBut the problem with this claim is a rather significant one: It is based on the outright, demonstrable falsehood that those who choose not to vote are primarily rich, white, and thus privileged, while those who lack those privileges - voters of color and poorer voters - are unwilling to abstain. This is something one can believe only if one's views of the country and its electorate are shaped by social media and cable news bubbles.\n\nThe truth is exactly the opposite. Those who choose not to vote because of dissatisfaction with the choices offered are disproportionately poorer and nonwhite, while rich white people vote in far larger percentages. And the data also makes clear that the primary motive for nonvoting among those demographic groups is not voter suppression but a belief that election outcomes do not matter because both parties are corrupt or interested only in the lives of the wealthy.\n\nThus, those who try to demean, malign and shame nonvoters are largely attacking poorer voters and voters of color, not the New York and California leftist trust-funders of their imagination.\n\nOne of the most comprehensive surveys of nonvoters was published by Pew Research Center on August 9, 2018. It summarized its bottom-line finding this way, the exact opposite of what is typically claimed by wealthy television media stars and D.C. operatives: \"Nonvoters were more likely to be younger, less educated, less affluent and nonwhite.\"\n\nThe Pew data on this issue is stark. Almost half of nonvoters in the 2016 presidential election were nonwhite, even though they compose only one-fourth of the voting population. Even more extreme is the data on class: More than half of nonvoters - 56% - are quite poor, making less than $30,000, even though that income group constitutes just over one-fourth of the voting population. The people who choose to vote are disproportionately privileged; those who are nonprivileged choose disproportionately not to vote.\n\nAs the Washington Post's summary of that survey put it: \"Pew's data shows that almost half of the nonvoters were nonwhite and two-thirds were under age 50. More than half of those who didn't vote earned less than $30,000 a year; more than half of those who did vote were over age 50.\"\n\nThose who choose not to vote - either those who are registered but do not vote or those who simply do not register - constitute a huge number of Americans. Indeed, the Post highlighted their size this way: \"about 30 percent of Americans were eligible to vote but decided not to, a higher percentage than the portion of the country who voted for either Trump or his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.\" And while rich white people chose to vote in large numbers in the 2016 presidential election, lower-income citizens and racial minorities composed a much larger portion of those who chose not to vote:\n\nIn November, New York Times data journalist Nate Cohn, analyzing data from a New York Times/Siena College survey of nonvoters in battleground states who abstained from voting both in 2016 and 2018, similarly described them as \"disproportionately young, nonwhite and low-income,\" adding that \"nonvoters are less likely to have graduated from a four-year college.\" In a separate article last July, Cohn noted that \"young and nonwhite and low-income voters are overrepresented among nonvoters,\" and \"young and nonwhite voters continued to vote at lower rates than older and white voters.\"\n\nThis was true not only for the 2016 election but also the 2018 mid-term election, by which time Trump had been president for almost two full years. As Cohn reported, \"young and nonwhite turnout was markedly higher than it had been in 2014, but still lower than that of older and white voters.\"\n\nPew found that \"in the U.S., roughly six-in-ten adults are registered to vote.\" Of them, \"four-in-ten Americans who were eligible to vote did not do so in 2016 .\" That means 40% of eligible voters in 2016 were nonvoters. The sheer number alone - millions of Americans - should preclude any claim that nonvoters are rich, white, and privileged people.\n\n[Even the voting preferences of the electorate are radically distorted by online \"privilege\" discourse: Aside from the fact that 28 percent of Hispanic people and 14 percent of black men voted for Trump in 2016 , rich white people voted for the Democratic candidate, not the GOP candidate, while poorer white people voted for Trump: \"whites with a four-year college degree or more education made up 30% of all validated voters. Among these voters, far more (55%) said they voted for Clinton than for Trump (38%). Among the much larger group of white voters who had not completed college (44% of all voters), Trump won by more than two-to-one (64% to 28%).\"]\n\nTo deny agency to poorer and nonwhite nonvoters, it is sometimes claimed that voter suppression efforts - rather than a cognizant and rational choice - is the primary factor explaining the behavior of poor and nonwhite nonvoters. That is also false.\n\nA separate Pew survey , in 2017, of people who are not registered to vote found exactly the opposite: that people who refrain from participating in the electoral process largely do so because they are dissatisfied with the choices or believe voting will not change their lives. As Pew put it: \"The unregistered were more likely to say they do not vote because they dislike politics or believe voting will not make a difference, while people who are registered but vote infrequently say they do not vote more often because they are not informed enough about the candidates or issues.\"\n\nIndeed, that Pew survey of unregistered voters found that the most common cause for not registering is that they do not want to vote , and the most common reasons have nothing to do with voter suppression and everything to do with beliefs about the worthlessness of the elections. As Pew put it, \"forty-four percent of eligible unregistered individuals say they do not want to vote,\" while \"25 percent say they are unregistered because they have not been inspired by a candidate or issue.\"\n\nAnd, Pew emphasized, both unregistered voters as well as registered voters who choose not to vote broadly express dissatisfaction with, or indifference toward, the two major parties and election outcomes as their motives: \"The unregistered are more likely to indicate a broad distaste for the electoral system than registered individuals, who tend to give election-specific motives for nonvoting, such as disliking the candidates or not knowing enough about the issues.\"\n\nThe Huffington Post, based on Pew data of people who chose not to vote in the 2018 midterm election, described the primary motive for abstention this way: \"many Americans who didn't vote in this year's midterm elections say they opted out due to a dislike of politics or a feeling their vote wouldn't matter.\" And nonvoters, it noted, also \" tend to skew younger, poorer and less white than those who do turn out.\"\n\nAll of this data demonstrates that, while GOP voter suppression efforts are both real and pernicious, nonvoting is overwhelmingly a choice. Indeed, the Pew survey of midterm voters and nonvoters concluded that, while minority voters disgracefully experience longer lines than white voters, \"about three-quarters of self-reported voters (76%) say it was 'very easy' for them to vote in the November elections. Another 16% say voting was 'somewhat easy.'\"\n\nWhile voter suppression is unquestionably a serious stain on U.S. political life that does (by design) impede voting, the overwhelming reason people stay home is due to cynicism toward or dissatisfaction with the political process and the choices they were presented. As the Huffington Post explained about the 2018 midterm elections, \"as a group, nonvoters also tend to be generally disengaged from public affairs and cynical about the government and their own roles in civic life. Nearly half of nonvoters in the most recent election said their personal dislike of politics played at least a minor role in their decision not to vote.\" The Pew chart highlights how widespread is this belief among nonvoters:\n\nNonvoters, despite their large numbers, are rarely discussed in mainstream U.S. precincts. In part that is because national media figures in cable news and Washington are overwhelmingly affluent and have little connection to or interest in them.\n\nBut in large part, that omission is explained by the fact that interrogating why so many millions of Americans choose not to vote would force the political and media class to grapple with the reason for this choice: Namely, the widespread perception that the political process and the two major parties are fundamentally corrupted and indifferent to all but a small sliver of privileged people. Confronting that problem and being forced to address it is far more difficult than creating a pleasant fiction that falsely maintains that people who abstain from voting do so because of selfish, amoral racial and class privilege.\n\nIn those few instances when nonvoters are honestly examined by large media outlets, a much different picture emerges than the one typically disseminated by affluent media stars and D.C. political operatives. One of the best and most thoughtful articles was a New York Times survey of African Americans in Milwaukee who chose not to vote in the 2016 election and, even knowing that it helped Trump win Wisconsin and thus the presidency, did not regret it.\n\nThe Times explained that \"the [2016] election was notable as much for the people who did not show up, as for those who did. Nationally, about half of eligible voters did not cast ballots.\" Wisconsin had its lowest turnout in 16 years. The Times added:\n\nMilwaukee's lowest-income neighborhoods offer one explanation for the turnout figures. Of the city's 15 council districts , the decline in turnout from 2012 to 2016 in the five poorest was consistently much greater than the drop seen in more prosperous areas - accounting for half of the overall decline in turnout citywide.\n\nThe interviews the paper conducted with African Americans and other poor residents of Milwaukee who chose not to vote were illuminating. They overwhelmingly said they did not regret their choice, even knowing Trump won, because they do not believe that the outcome of elections improves their lives, and do not believe that a victory by the Democratic Party would be meaningful for them. One Milwaukee barber, Cedric Fleming, said in a quote that was representative of the survey: \"I don't feel bad. Milwaukee is tired. Both of them [Clinton and Trump] were terrible. They never do anything for us anyway.\"\n\nThe Times quoted another Milwaukee barber as follows:\n\n\"I'm so numb,\" said Jahn Toney, 45, who had written in Mr. Sanders. He said no president in his lifetime had done anything to improve the lives of black people, including Mr. Obama, whom he voted for twice. \"It's like I should have known this would happen. We're worse off than before.\"\n\nThat rationale for nonvoting - \"both of them were terrible. They never do anything for us anyway\" - is typically cast by media personalities and Washington operatives as the province of rich, white, privileged leftists. But that claim is a lie. The data makes overwhelmingly clear that those who make that choice are often those with the least amount of privilege who believe, with good reason, that both parties and the political process generally are constructed to have no interest in improving their lives.\n\nIt is crucial to understand who nonvoters are, and what their motives are for choosing to abstain, not only to prevent media figures and D.C. operatives from disseminating disinformation, but also because that understanding highlights what kinds of candidates can motivate the millions of nonvoters to go to the polls. As the New York Times' Nate Cohn explained, the candidates most closely associated with the status quo are ones most likely to drive voters away from the polls, while those who appear to be outsiders who intend to deviate from bipartisan consensus are most likely to motivate them. That's why Sanders, in 2019, had the greatest appeal among nonvoters when he was perceived as something other than a traditional Democrat:\n\nWhen it comes to the candidates, Mr. Sanders shows relative strength among nonvoters: He has a 41 percent \"very favorable\" rating in the group, compared with 33 percent for Mr. Biden and 30 percent for Ms. Warren. This is at least in part because of Mr. Sanders's longtime appeal to young voters.\n\nNot only is Mr. Sanders's favorability rating the best of these three candidates, but he is also the only Democrat whose favorability rating is stronger among nonvoting Democratic leaners than among those who have voted before. His outsider status and promise of fundamental change, without much focus on cultural issues, might offer at least one clue for how Democrats might appeal to these nonvoters, though it need not be the only one.\n\nPolling already indicates that Joe Biden faces a serious problem whereby even his supporters - to say nothing of nonvoters - have extremely low enthusiasm for his candidacy . He could certainly win, but it will not be because he motivates large numbers of nonvoters to go the polls.\n\nWhatever else is true, those who make the choice to abstain from voting in presidential and midterm elections are overwhelmingly anything but \"privileged.\" The claim that they are is deliberate disinformation spread by the political and media elite class to suppress the reality of their own systemic failures when it comes to serving the needs of the vast majority of the population and to try to shame, rather than persuade, disaffected people to vote for their candidate.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "For July 4, Here Are 10 Shockingly Radical Things the Founding Fathers Said\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Founding Fathers made startlingly progressive statements that didn't make it into popular history.\n\nThe Founding Fathers signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia on July 4, 1776, by John Trumbull in 1819.\n\nAmericans love to talk about our Founding Fathers, with many of us believing they were infallible geniuses. We can tell this isn't true just by reading this letter from John Adams to his wife Abigail on July 3, 1776:\n\nThe second day of July 1776, will be the most memorable epoch in the history of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival.\n\nWhoops! Adams thought this because the Second Continental Congress had passed the Lee Resolution on July 2, the day before. The Lee Resolution was actually the first declaration of independence, proclaiming that \"these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British Crown.\" But July 4 became the date we celebrate because Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence had more zing.\n\nThe Founding Fathers were mindlessly venerated for hundreds of years, until Americans who weren't rich white men gained some input on this subject. They remain mindlessly venerated on the U.S. right, which loves them in the same way the U.S. right loves Jesus: i.e., without bothering to pay attention to what they actually said. This doesn't mean the Founding Fathers were like Jesus, and indeed, many of them were standard-issue grotesques. But some of them did make startlingly progressive and even radical statements that later became inconvenient and hence have largely dropped out of history.\n\nIt's true that words are cheap, and these edicts generally were at odds with the actions of their speakers, especially when any of them held formal power. Still, it's worth remembering what they said, because 1) it illustrates how complicated humans and history are, and 2) it's fruitful to pull these things out during political arguments.\n\nOriginal reporting.

If I've left any of your favorites out, please let me know, and maybe I can write a sequel next July 4.\n\nBenjamin Franklin (1706-90), American Printer, Publisher, Author, Inventor, Scientist, Diplomat and one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.\n\nIn 1783, Benjamin Franklin, who was then the U.S. minister to France, described his perspective on property. This would today place him far to the left of the Democratic Party and would probably cause prominent Republicans to call for his execution:\n\n... the Public has the Right of Regulating Descents & all other Conveyances of Property, and even of limiting the Quantity & the Uses of it. All the Property that is necessary to a Man for the Conservation of the Individual & the Propagation of the Species, is his natural Right which none can justly deprive him of: But all Property superfluous to such purposes is the Property of the Publick, who by their Laws have created it, and who may therefore by other Laws dispose of it, whenever the Welfare of the Publick shall demand such Disposition. He that does not like civil Society on these Terms ... can have no right to the Benefits of Society who will not pay his Club towards the Support of it.\n\nEarlier in his life, Franklin made the case for universal health care, paid for with public money, based on the precepts of Christianity:\n\nThe great Author of our Faith, whose Life should be the constant Object of our Imitation, as far as it is not inimitable, always shew'd the greatest Compassion and Regard for the Sick ...\n\nThis Branch of Charity seems essential to the true Spirit of Christianity; and should be extended to all in general, whether Deserving or Undeserving, as far as our Power reaches. ... the great Physician in sending forth his Disciples, always gave them a particular Charge, that into whatsoever City they entered, they should heal All the Sick , without Distinction. ...\n\nWe are in this World mutual Hosts to each other ... how careful should we be not to harden our Hearts against the Distresses of our Fellow Creatures, lest He who owns and governs all, should punish our Inhumanity.\n\nThen again, Franklin said some ugly things about \"the poor\" and also was concerned the Anglo-Saxon whiteness of the colonies would be contaminated by \"swarthy\" races such as the French and Swedes.\n\nIn 1776, Adams endorsed the concept of false consciousness, i.e., that lower economic classes adopt the perspective of those at the top. Friedrich Engels later made that same argument, and it's now considered a Marxist idea, but as the words of Adams show, it's as American as you can get:\n\nSuch is the Frailty of the human Heart, that very few Men, who have no Property, have any Judgment of their own. They talk and vote as they are directed by Some Man of Property, who has attached their Minds to his Interest.\n\nAt the same time, Adams also proposed a solution - the redistribution of property:\n\n[P]ower always follows property. This I believe to be as infallible a maxim in politics, as that action and reaction are equal is in mechanics. Nay, I believe we may advance one step farther, and affirm that the balance of power in a society accompanies the balance of property in land. The only possible way, then, of preserving the balance of power on the side of equal liberty and public virtue is to make the acquisition of land easy to every member of society; to make a division of the land into small quantities, so that the multitude may be possessed of landed estates. If the multitude is possessed of the balance of real estate, the multitude will have the balance of power, and in that case the multitude will take care of the liberty, virtue, and interest of the multitude in all acts of government.\n\nGouverneur Morris, a less-famous founder, wrote the preamble to the Constitution, was one of its signatories, and later became a senator from New York. At the Constitutional Convention, he said this about the danger the U.S. would face from the wealthy:\n\nThe Executive Magistrate should be the guardian of the people, even of the lower classes, [against] Legislative tyranny, against the Great & the wealthy who in the course of things will necessarily compose the Legislative body. Wealth tends to corrupt the mind & to nourish its love of power, and to stimulate it to oppression. History proves this to be the spirit of the opulent.\n\nAmerica's children would definitely be more interested in history if they knew this, and also that Morris died when he experienced a urinary blockage and stuck a whalebone up his penis .\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743-1826), Third President of the United States 1801-09.\n\nOf the first 12 presidents of the U.S., 10 enslaved other human beings. (The exceptions were Adams and his son, John Quincy Adams.) In private, they occasionally decried the practice. Near the end of George Washington's life, he purportedly said that \"[t]he unfortunate condition of the persons, whose labor in part I employed, has been [my] only unavoidable subject of regret.\"\n\nMost significantly , Jefferson's first draft of the Declaration of Independence indicted King George III for the presence of slavery in the colonies:\n\n[H]e has waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating it's most sacred rights of life & liberty in the persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating & carrying them into slavery in another hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in their transportation thither. this piratical warfare, the opprobrium of infidel powers, is the warfare of the CHRISTIAN king of Great Britain. determined to keep open a market where MEN should be bought & sold, he has prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain this execrable commerce: and that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished die, he is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us, and to purchase that liberty of which he has deprived them, & murdering the people upon whom he also obtruded them; thus paying off former crimes committed against the liberties of one people, with crimes which he urges them to commit against the lives of another.\n\nIt's bizarre that Jefferson, who himself owned 600 people over the course of his life, blamed someone else for the existence of slavery. Morally and intellectually, power does not bring out the best in people, as Jefferson himself expressed in one of the greatest veiled self-indictments in history. But the strength of his condemnation demonstrates that everyone understood at the time that what they were doing was pure evil.\n\nDecades later, Jefferson recalled that this passage had been \"struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia, who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves, and who on the contrary still wished to continue it. Our northern brethren also I believe felt a little tender under those censures; for tho' their people have very few slaves themselves yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others.\" I.e., the South employed slavery to a far greater degree than the North, but the North profited enormously from the slave trade.\n\nJames Madison (1751-1836), Fourth President of the United States 1809-17.\n\nAt the time of the American Revolution, elites across the world believed that they were inherently intellectually superior to the lower classes and had to be in charge for the good of everybody. But some Founding Fathers adopted the then-radical position that all people could learn how the world works and participate in their own governance. In 1822, James Madison, who'd been president until 1817, wrote this letter to William T. Barry, then the lieutenant governor of Kentucky:\n\nThe liberal appropriations made by the Legislature of Kentucky for a general system of Education cannot be too much applauded. A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives. ...\n\nLearned Institutions ought to be favorite objects with every free people. They throw that light over the public mind which is the best security against crafty & dangerous encroachments on the public liberty.\n\nI wish I could force you to read the whole thing because it's an inspiring manifesto about the liberatory power of education, as well as uncannily relevant given the current loathing of education and universities on the right. On the other hand, both Madison and Barry enslaved other human beings, so I don't know what to tell you.\n\nA year later, in 1823, Jefferson wrote a letter to Adams. I find Jefferson's faith in the upside of new information technology to be touching, especially here in the early days of the internet. I'm not sure he was right, but I'd like to believe he was:\n\nThe light which has been shed on mankind by the art of printing has eminently changed the condition of the world. as yet that light has dawned on the midling classes only of the men of Europe. The kings and the rabble of equal ignorance, have not yet recieved it's rays; but it continues to spread. And, while printing is preserved, it can no more recede than the sun return on his course. ... all will attain representative government ... to attain all this however rivers of blood must yet flow, & years of desolation pass over, yet the object is worth rivers of blood, and years of desolation. For what inheritance, so valuable, can man leave to his posterity?... You and I shall look down from another world on these glorious atchievements to man, which will add to the joys even of heaven.\n\nToday it's somehow become conventional wisdom on the right that the electoral college was put into the Constitution to give rural states a greater weight in presidential elections. But at the Constitutional Convention, Madison explained why the electoral college was an unfortunate necessity. It would be best for the president to be elected by popular vote, he said , but the South would never allow it, both because they allowed fewer white people to vote and because they had enslaved so much of their population:\n\nThe people at large was in his opinion the fittest [choice to elect the president] in itself. It would be as likely as any that could be devised to produce an Executive Magistrate of distinguished Character. ... There was one difficulty however of a serious nature attending an immediate choice by the people. The right of suffrage was much more diffusive in the Northern than the Southern States; and the latter could have no influence in the election on the score of the Negroes. The substitution of electors obviated this difficulty and seemed on the whole to be liable to fewest objections.\n\nSmallpox was once a terrifying scourge across the world, with a death rate among those infected of 30 percent. By 1720, the practice of inoculation, a predecessor to vaccination, had been introduced in the British colonies. However, one of Franklin's sons died of smallpox in 1736. Soon afterward, Franklin wrote in the Pennsylvania Gazette about cruel rumors that his child had died not because he wasn't inoculated against smallpox, but from the inoculation itself:\n\nUnderstanding 'tis a current Report, that my Son Francis, who died lately of the Small Pox, had it by Inoculation; and being desired to satisfy the Publick in that Particular; inasmuch as some People are, by that Report (join'd with others of the like kind, and perhaps equally groundless) deter'd from having that Operation perform'd on their Children, I do hereby sincerely declare, that he was not inoculated, but receiv'd the Distemper in the common Way of Infection: And I suppose the Report could only arise from its being my known Opinion, that Inoculation was a safe and beneficial Practice.\n\nAt the end of his life, Franklin was still desperate to tell parents in his autobiography that they should use human knowledge to prevent disease.\n\nIn 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the smallpox, taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly, and still regret, that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I mention for the stake of parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it.\n\nIn America's early days, as now, there were many people at the top of society who simply didn't believe that regular human beings could govern themselves, and hence they had to be controlled by their betters. Such people nonetheless felt compelled by political necessity - then as now - to deliver constant rhetoric about the wisdom of common folk. In 1824, two years before Jefferson's death, he wrote to a correspondent about the reality behind these disingenuous homilies:\n\nMen by their constitutions are naturally divided into two parties. 1. those who fear and distrust the people, and wish to draw all powers from them into the hands of the higher classes. 2dly those who identify themselves with the people, have confidence in them cherish and consider them as the most honest & safe, altho' not the most wise depository of the public interests. in every country these two parties exist, and in every one where they are free to think, speak, and write, they will declare themselves. call them therefore liberals and serviles, Jacobins and Ultras, whigs and tories, republicans and federalists, aristocrats and democrats or by whatever name you please; they are the same parties still and pursue the same object. the last appellation of artistocrats and democrats is the true one expressing the essence of all.\n\nIt's unquestionable that both of the main political parties in the U.S. now are controlled by people who are, in Jefferson's formulation, aristocrats.\n\nAgain, the Founding Fathers did not know everything. In addition to that embarrassing mistake about July 2, Adams supposedly whispered, \"Jefferson still lives,\" as he died on July 4, 1826. In fact, Jefferson had expired several hours previously.\n\nBut you have to admit it's cool they both died 50 years to the day after the Declaration of Independence. The founders weren't saints or heroes, but the fact some of them could think such radical thoughts 250 years ago should teach us not to fear thinking and debating such radical things today.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

      "text": "HBO's \"Succession\" Is a Masterful Demolition of the Absurdity and Cruelty of Our 1 Percent Overlords\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\n\"Succession\" isn't directly about the Murdochs and Fox. It's about a class of super-wealthy individuals who are manifestly unfit to rule.\n\nIf you had to sum up decades of financial dystopia in America, you could go with the phrase \"Money wins.\" The accumulation of insane amounts of wealth by the 1 percent has flattened in its path everything else: the interests of ordinary people and the planet, as well as the notion that fairness should be a social compact rather than a sucker's delusion.\n\nThe phrase comes from one of the most scathing accounts of our economically twisted times: the newest season of HBO's \" Succession ,\" which is both a drama and comedy about a billionaire family based loosely on Rupert Murdoch and his children. The patriarch of the fictional family in \"Succession\" is Logan Roy, who has built a media and entertainment empire from scratch, with a cable network at its heart that is a dead ringer for Fox News. In the new season of the show, which starts on Sunday, Logan is surrounded by his heirs and assorted hangers-on as he celebrates another business triumph by chillingly proclaiming, \"Money wins. Here's to us!\"\n\nThis season of \"Succession,\" its second, is being rightly praised as pretty much the best thing to watch at the moment. The show is a genre-bending mashup of \"Veep,\" \"King Lear,\" and \"Empire.\" As critics have noted, the writing and acting are stellar, to the extent that even supporting actors have unofficial fan clubs. It's impossible, for instance, to not be transfixed by the hilariously instrumental relationship between the secondary characters played by Matthew Macfadyen and Nicholas Braun (\"Back off, this is executive-level business!\" Macfadyen screams to his inferiors during a madcap scene in which he pelts Braun with water bottles.)\n\nNicholas Braun, left, as Greg Hirsch, in a scene with Matthew Macfadyen, right, as Tom Wamsgans, in the second season of HBO's \"Succession\" in 2019.\n\nAllison Keene noted in Paste Magazine that the show is a \"marriage of parody with reality,\" and she's right. But our laughs shouldn't make us treat it as just a joke. Remember, \"Succession\" is also reality: The show is based on years of research by its creator, Jesse Armstrong, who initially wrote a biopic about Rupert Murdoch and his heirs, the owners of Fox News. When that script didn't pan out, Armstrong expanded his research to other media families and moguls, including Conrad Black and Sumner Redstone. The members of the Roy family are fictions drawn from multiple sources, but in their evident unfitness to rule, in their manifest sadomasochism, they are true-to-life iterations of our 1 percent overlords.\n\n\"Everybody is a coward, everybody is an idiot and everybody is trying to cover their back almost all of the time,\" said Lucy Prebble, a writer and executive producer of the show, in an interview with the BBC. \"That does feel what reality is like at the moment in terms of the powerful.\"\n\nJeremy Strong, as Kendall Roy, in a scene with sibling rival Siobhan \"Shiv\" Roy, played by Sarah Snook, in the second season of HBO's \"Succession\" in 2019.\n\nThe show's centerpiece is the rivalry between the three offspring who are vying to succeed the patriarch Logan, portrayed with masterful cunning by Brian Cox. As Variety has observed , the children are competing for the affection and favor of \"an active madman,\" and because they are foolish enough or greedy enough to seek his crown, they clearly deserve the humiliation that comes their way. The first season of the show, as well as the five episodes of the upcoming season that have been provided to reviewers, lay out on a cold examining table the foibles and faults of each would-be successor.\n\nIt's hard not to be entertained by their absurdities. Look at Roman Roy, the youngest son, played with sleazy excellence by Kieran Culkin, who in the first season jauntily walked into his glass office, closed the interior blinds so co-workers could not see him, and proceeded to pleasure himself against an exalted view of the New York City skyline. In the second season, Roman finds yet another way, even more surprising, to satisfy his carnal inclinations and make us laugh or recoil in repulsion. He is a court jester with executive responsibilities, and the result is what you would expect. At the end of the last season, overseeing the development of a rocket that he had hurried to the launch pad, he watched a livestream on his phone as it exploded on takeoff - and then, in a bathroom, he literally washed his hands and returned to his sister's wedding party as though nothing bad had happened. He seems too ridiculous for real life: How could anyone as inept as this third-rate scion be allowed near the C-suite?\n\nThe Murdoch correlation is relevant here. Just as the fictional Logan Roy has two sons and one daughter in the running to succeed him, Rupert Murdoch has two sons and one daughter who worked in his empire at various points and jockeyed to take over. In the real world, Murdoch's eldest son, Lachlan , has won that competition, recently becoming the chief executive of Fox Corporation, largely because his politics are a carbon copy of the old man's white supremacy. Lachlan is, in this way, a version of the eldest son in \"Succession\": Kendall Roy, portrayed brilliantly by Jeremy Strong, spends the first episodes of the new season as a windup zombie, executing whatever orders his despotic father gives him.\n\nRelated The Problem at Fox News Is Not Just Tucker Carlson - It's the Murdoch Family Who Owns and Controls the Network\n\nMurdoch's second son (his Roman, as it were) is James , a Harvard dropout who keenly wanted to succeed his father but missed his chance earlier this decade by botching a phone-hacking scandal at the family newspapers he oversaw in London. James's failure was akin to Roman screwing up the rocket launch. James claimed, without much plausibility, that he had not read emails sent to him about the hacking scandal and that he had approved extravagant payoffs without knowing they were to cover up serious misdeeds. When the British government investigated the matter in 2012, its assessment of James was brutal. \"James Murdoch's exercise of responsibility was less than we would expect to see exhibited by a competent Chief Executive Officer,\" the Office of Communications wrote , adding that his leadership \"repeatedly fell short of the exercise of responsibility to be expected of him.\"\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members.

      "text": "Deconstructed Special: The Right Won the Battle Over Brett Kavanaugh. Can the Left Win the War?\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA panel of guests joins Mehdi Hasan to discuss the Kavanaugh confirmation and how the left should respond.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh has been confirmed today as Supreme Court justice of the United States in a 50-48 vote in the Senate, despite three different allegations of sexual assault and misconduct, opposition and criticism from American Bar Association, and a letter penned by his \"drinking buddies\" saying he is unfit for the position. He also seems to have perjured himself in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee just nine days ago, lying under oath about everything, from his drinking to the sexual references in his yearbook, and exposing himself to be an angry and partisan Republican hack. The message of today's vote is clear: If you're a rich, white, conservative man in America, you do not have to face the consequences of your actions and you will not be held accountable for your lies or your behavior. Mehdi Hasan is joined by The Intercept 's Senior Politics Editor Briahna Gray and D.C. Bureau Chief Ryan Grim, the feminist author and activist Naomi Wolf, and senior adviser to the Women's March Winnie Wong in this special episode to discuss what Kavanaugh's confirmation means for women in America and what the Democrats can do to stop a Supreme Court dominated by the hard right from rolling back everything progressives have fought for.\n\nActivist: The energy, the passion, the fierce activism on display right here, reflects the fury that voters, especially women, but so many of us together across this country are feeling.\n\n[musical interlude]\n\nMehdi Hasan: I'm Mehdi Hasan, welcome to the show, which is a special \"Oh my God they actually just went and confirmed Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\" edition of Deconstructed.\n\nCrowd: Sham! Sham! Sham! Sham!\n\nMH: That was the scene outside the Capitol today, as inside the Senate horrific history was being made.\n\nVice President Mike Pence: On this vote the yeas are 50, the nays are 48. The nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States is confirmed.\n\nMH: Are you angry? You should be because I'm angry. I'm fucking furious. Excuse my language. What a day. What a week. What a month this has been. This afternoon, Saturday the 6th of October, 2018, Brett Michael Kavanaugh, U.S. Court of Appeals judge for the District of Columbia circuit, former staff secretary to George W Bush, former member of Kenneth Starr's investigation into Bill Clinton and former student of Georgetown Prep and Yale University where he was accused of sexual assault by not one, not two, but by three different women. That Brett Kavanaugh has been confirmed today as the 114th Supreme Court Justice of the United States, despite opposition and criticism from two and a half thousand law professors, the American Bar Association, hundreds of alumni of Georgetown Prep, his former roommate at Yale, the former Republican Supreme Court Justice and a former supporter of his, John Paul Stevens.\n\nJohn Paul Stevens: At that time, I thought he had definitely the qualifications to sit on the Supreme Court. His performance during the hearings caused me to change my mind.\n\nMH: Despite opposition from three of his closest friends from Yale who wrote a Washington Post op-ed on Thursday headlined \"We Were Brett Kavanaugh's Drinking Buddies. We Don't Think He Should Be Confirmed\".\n\nDespite opposition from thousands of people marching in the streets here in Washington D.C., hundreds of women occupying Senate office buildings day after day, many of them survivors of rape or sexual assault, and speaking in the offices of supposedly undecided senators, telling their own horrific stories... despite all of that, Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed, today, to the highest court in the land, for a lifetime position with one Republican, Lisa Murkoswki of Alaska voting against and one Democrat, the shameless, disgraceful, right-wing enabler Joe Manchin of West Virginia voting in favor. And please don't give me this crap about Manchin being a conservative Democrat in a red state, so he has to vote like this or he'll lose his re-election race, because what is the point of electing Democrats to Republican states if they're going to vote like Republicans anyways? Seriously, what is the point? And how does Manchin even get to be called a Democrat after this vote of his today?\n\nBut it wasn't just Manchin who helped get Kavanaugh across the line. There were the so-called swing voters, Jeff Flake and Susan Collins, who pretended to be moderate Republicans, pretended to be non-ideological and interested in bipartisan compromise, but tend to vote with their party, with Donald Trump, on nearly every major occasion. They're not swing voters, they're not moderates; they're frauds, plain and simple.\n\nLest we forget, the newest member of the Supreme Court was credibly accused of sexual assault by three different named women.\n\nDick Durbin: Dr. Ford with what degree of certainty do you believe Brett Kavanaugh assaulted you?\n\nChristine Blasey Ford: 100%.\n\nMH: He also seems to have perjured himself in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee just nine days ago, lying under oath about everything from his drinking to the sexual references in his yearbook; he also exposed himself to be not a sober, impartial jurist but, rather, an angry and partisan Republican hack.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh: This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election... revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.\n\nMH: And yet they still confirmed him. The message of today's vote is crystal clear: If you're a rich white man in America, a rich white conservative man in America, you do not have to face the consequences of your actions, you do not have to have to be held accountable for your lies, you never have to apologize for your behavior. There is an old boys club and there is a culture of impunity. And no, this country is not a meritocracy.\n\nThe gravity of today's vote, today's confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh cannot be overstated. Kavanaugh joining the Supreme Court and entrenching a hard-right, conservative, Trumpian majority will have consequences not just for you, not just today, tomorrow, or even next year, but for your kids, your grandkids, maybe even your great grandkids.\n\nBrett Kavanaugh is 53 years old. He's got maybe 30 years ahead of him on the Supreme Court. Three decades in which to rule against action on climate change, against Medicare for All, against Roe versus Wade, against protections for workers, against campaign finance reform, against affirmative action, and in favor of gerrymandering, voter suppression, corporate power and yes, corrupt presidents. Hell, maybe he'll even help the Supreme Court deliver the Republican Party another illegitimate presidency a la Bush vs Gore in December 2000.\n\nSo, the questions I want to ask today are about where we go from here. What does the resistance to Kavanaugh do now? What can Democrats do, if anything, to try and stop a Supreme Court dominated by the hard right from rolling back everything progressives hold near and dear to their hearts? And where does the Kavanaugh confirmation leave women in this country, where does it leave the MeToo movement?\n\nSo, on this week's Deconstructed, the Republicans may have won the battle over Kavanaugh, but how do the rest of us win the war?\n\n[musical interlude]\n\nMH: My first guest today is my good friend Ryan Grim, head of The Intercept's DC Bureau and one of the reporters who helped break the Christine Blasey Ford story back in early September.\n\nHe was on Deconstructed a couple of weeks ago talking Brett Kavanaugh and he's back again now on this historic and deeply depressing day. Ryan, first off, what's your reaction to today's vote? Is this what you thought would happen all along?\n\nRyan Grim: No, not exactly. I continue to underestimate the Republican party's willingness to kind of plow through norms and plow through opposition and just take the slings and arrows to get the result that they want. And I think part of that comes from the fact that I cover the Democratic party and liberal and progressive movements much more so than I cover the Republican party and the difference there on that question is just so stark. The Republican party is a very much means justify the ends. They're going to get the result they want whatever they have to do.\n\nWhereas, you know, liberals are much more beholden to the process and beholden to how things look. So, no, I thought that there was a decent chance that he would withdraw.\n\nMH: That he would withdraw, not just that Flake or Collins might grow a spine or get a conscience?\n\nRG: No, I didn't necessarily think that Flake or Collins were the ones that you would rely on but in politics you get a certain amount of public pressure and then nominees withdraw. That's kind of how it works and the Republicans are saying here is \"No, we're not actually going to follow that script.\"\n\nMH: But hasn't Trump - Trump's changed that script.\n\nRG: Yes.\n\nMH: Because the moment that tape came out where he bragged about sexual assault, everyone assumed normal politics in any country in the world, he would have pulled out or been forced to pull out by his party. When he plowed through that, to use Mitch McConnell's phrase. Then Roy Moore was able to plow through and stay on as a candidate and Brett Kavanaugh can turn up and shout at the Senate and say I'm not going anywhere.\n\nRG: Right, so Trump changed it for Trump. And he was immune to gravity but gravity still applied to every other object and it even brought Roy Moore down in the ballot at the end. This is kind of the first case of Trump's immunity to gravity extending to another object and it being Kavanaugh just saying \"You will not intimidate me. I will not drop out. I'm going to push through,\" and doing it.\n\nMH: And push through and gets this narrow vote and one of the narrowest votes ever for Supreme Court Justice. What do you think Brett Kavanaugh's thinking right now? How is he celebrating this evening? Is he thinking \"Yes screw the Clintons, screw George Soros.\"\n\nRG: Brewskis.\n\nMH: He likes beer, I've heard. I don't know if I can confirm this but he may like beer.\n\nRG: Yes. I think skis, skis are being had at Tobin's, Timmy's.\n\nMH: I don't know whether to laugh or cry right now.\n\nRG: The real question is less how Kavanaugh is responding. I think that's not quite knowable yet. The other question is, how is John Roberts going to respond to this? Believe it or not, John Roberts is now the swing vote.\n\nMH: And of course, he famously gave that vote to save Obamacare back in, what is it? 2012. Swing vote is this ultra-conservative chief justice, but that's only if it's five-four. The really depressing prospect is it could go 6-3.\n\nRG: Right.\n\nMH: It could go 7-2. I mean Ruth Bader Ginsburg is in her 80s. Breyer, 80. Trump could get two more justices, especially if he wins re-election in 2020. I mean, it's a nightmare scenario, but it is a realistic scenario. It's not impossible.\n\nRG: Right and if Republicans hold the Senate in November as looks possible. It looks more likely than not. Democrats have a chance they'd have to hit every single one. So, it's not impossible. And you know now people are out saying - well now, people are angry about the way that old Brett was treated and so they're going to come out and vote.\n\nMH: One of the things they're doing to try and rev up their base, I thought Donald Trump Jr., that great political analyst and scholar tweeting earlier about how they're going to try and impeach Kavanaugh. Make sure you protect the Senate turn out and vote. But the irony is that even if the Democrats were to win the Senate and as you say it's highly improbable, they're not going to get the two-thirds majority that you would need in the Senate to impeach.\n\nYou can impeach him in the House with a simple majority and the Democrats in the House may do that. But in the Senate, you're not going to get those that two-thirds majority which is why I wrote a piece if you remember about a week, 10 days ago saying it's time to pack the court. It's time for Democrats to talk about expanding the number of justices on the court. A lot of traditional centrist folks say \"Hold on, you can't do that. It's a pipe dream. It's a fantasy. It's never going to happen.\"\n\nI suspect after today more and more people are going to be coming around to my way of thinking and saying, you know what the only way to balance this hugely imbalanced court in which a crazy right-wing John Roberts is a swing voter is to add some liberal justices when there's another liberal President.\n\nRG: Right. Democrats are very reluctant to break norms on their own. And you know, if you look at the way that when they finally got rid of the judicial filibuster, it was only after several years of McConnell just flat out basically refusing to allow Obama to put executive branch or judicial branch nominees in place. So finally, they responded by getting rid of the filibuster for most judges.\n\nAnd so right, in other words now that Republicans have now gone and done, you know struck two blows against the Supreme Court: one holding open the Merrick Garland seat throughout the entire election and then two ramming through this guy without full public disclosure about his background.\n\nThey're still sitting on tens of thousands of documents and putting it through on this very narrow vote. Now you've pushed the norm ferry back a little bit. So that gives Democrats more room to say \"Okay, look, here's what we're going to do to respond to that\" because Democrats very rarely make the first move, but often they're willing to respond.\n\nAnd so, the response isn't necessarily - the response is to publicly call for impeachment, but if they do get power to then add justices to the court to balance them out.\n\nMH: I suspect they won't do that but I think the more we have this conversation the more likely it is to happen. Ryan, thanks so much for taking time out to speak to me.\n\nRG: Thank you for having me here.\n\nMH: That was Ryan Grim, our D.C. bureau chief who's been out front on this Kavanaugh story for several weeks now. Joining me to carry on the discussion about where we go from here, what activists can do now and how screwed up the US political and legal system now is are my Intercept colleague Briahna Joy Gray, our senior politics editor who wrote a much-discussed piece last week headlined 'The Unbearable Dishonesty of Brett Kavanaugh, and Winnie Wong, senior adviser to the Women's March, co-founder of People for Bernie and one of the organizers of the big protest at the Capitol this week.\n\nWinnie Wong, Briahna Joy, thank you both for joining me on Deconstructed. Winnie, a lot of us are feeling a combination of depression and anger today. I would assume that you're feeling it more than a lot of us. You've spent the past few days protesting at the Senate outside the offices of Republican senators, getting arrested, shouting in the gallery of the Senate at Susan Collins as she gave her absurd apology for Brett Kavanaugh yesterday. How do you feel today?\n\nWinnie Wong: I'm definitely not depressed. I am enraged, but that's like a normal sort of state for me and has been for some time now. I feel, candidly, a little shell-shocked because I expected that we would win. These series of protests have been rolling for the last month and I think you know, if you were paying attention, if you've been paying attention this nomination received very, very little mainstream news coverage and he was supposed to sail through this confirmation process.\n\nNone of what we have seen over the past month should have happened. And we turned the tide on that, really. We kind of we co-opted their narrative and made it ours. And so, I think what we have done is like we've created momentum to continue the real resistance work that needs to be done. And I think that's good. And so, I guess like, you know, for me, like as an activist and as an organizer, defeat is not really something that I dwell on. It's just not how that works.\n\nMH: That's a good position to be in.\n\nWW: Yeah.\n\nMH: Briahna, despite all the protests from folks like Winnie and others on the capital - amazing scenes in recent days - despite journalists, like yourself, documenting cataloguing, clearly laying out Brett Kavanaugh's clear lies, numerous lies under oath in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he still made it onto the Supreme Court today. He still made history. What does that tell us? What does that tell you about the state of modern America?\n\nBriahna Joy Gray: There has been a lot of conversation over the course of Trump's presidency and during you know, 2016 about whether there's a crisis of democracy and whether there has just been too much political balkanization for us to really communicate with each other across the aisle in any meaningful way. And I've resisted a lot of that characterization. I've resisted it partly because I think that what people are seeing as new has been there for a long time and that Trump has simply made it in-civil enough for people who are generally complacent to notice. I did start to feel though over the course of the past week, I have to confess, a kind of despondency that felt new because there was just so much evidence. For me particularly as a lawyer, I think I was just so overwhelmed by how clear a standard there was that he didn't meet.\n\nMH: He didn't meet it for like a low-level court judge let alone the Supreme Court.\n\nBJG: He's not qualified for the job he has in my opinion and the ABA had questions about him when he was being chosen for the Appellate Court. He had no experience as a judge prior to that so this idea that he's a super qualified person from Yale - yada, yada, yada. It's beyond the pale -\n\nMH: Top of his class at Yale, which is a lie. Another lie.\n\nBJG: Highly skeptical, you know, but I do think that what was interesting was listening to Murkowski's statement last night, which I think most people had tuned out of by that point, because what she announced was a standard that is very different from this \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" criminal law standard that we've heard people go on and on about and her standard, very sensibly, was a standard laid out by the Judicial Code of Conduct, which is supposed to set forth the standard for all federal judges and what that says is very simply, what is common sense, which is that judges should behave with a level of decorum that inspires faith in the institution of the Supreme Court.\n\nMH: Not rant and rave on live T.V.\n\nBJG: Exactly.\n\nMH: Not lie a number of times about things that are demonstrably untrue.\n\nBJG: Exactly and that's how we like - when she said that, when it came so close, like using that standard requires you to come to the conclusion that she came to. And her speech actually exposed why there's such a commitment to that reasonable doubt standard because that's the only way. Setting a criminal standard that's set that high -\n\nMH: He wasn't on trial. You've made this point on Twitter, you made this point in your articles. This ludicrous argument that Susan Collins advanced again to say that \"this is so unfair to him because -\" and I think Lindsey Graham said well \"- the Maryland police would never have even investigated this. He's not - he wasn't on trial for assaulting Christine Blasey Ford.\n\nBJG: He wasn't on trial. Even a civil trial -\n\nMH: It was a job interview, last time I checked and most people don't get the job when they perform like that at the interview.\n\nBJG: Exactly and even this, like a preponderance of evidence standard, which is what Collins said that she used to come to this decision, more reasonable than that, even that is too high because there's again, not even a civil deprivation here. There's not even the possibility that anything material is going to be taken away from him. Nothing was going to be taken away from him. He was being offered an opportunity and he didn't meet the measure that that opportunity required.\n\nMH: Winnie, Winnie, activists on the left have spent a lot of time rightly focusing in recent years on corporate power, the Koch Brothers, Wall Street, Fox News. Bernie Sanders who you're close to has talked a lot about the media's role in pushing this right-wing reactionary agenda that we've seen in the United States in recent years - is it time now finally, past time, to add the Supreme Court to the list of organizations and institutions which are basically barriers to progressive politics in this country? Does the left now have to recognize the Supreme Court as something that needs tackling, reforming?\n\nWW: Yes. I think you know, there is a movement right now to talk about packing the courts. So we first have to understand that this process is a sham. This whole process has been an absolute sham and candidly embarrassing for anybody participating in the Democratic process, which I guess is all of us.\n\nMH: Can I say as on behalf of the rest of the world is the foreigner here? Yes, everyone's laughing at you.\n\nWW: It's embarrassing but we now find ourselves having to do a couple of things right? We have to win the Senate, we have to win the House. Then we have to talk about packing the courts, you know, which is not going to be a two-year process likely. It could be a four-year process. But we are going to to do that. We are going to have to do that because you know, these two judges are young, you know. They're going to be there for -\n\nMH: Thirty, forty years.\n\nWW: Thirty, forty years. And that could also change. We don't know what that look will look like. But I mean I think that we're in a period of like real transformation. We're about to experience like some systemic transformation perhaps.\n\nMH: And I don't think - my worry is that because the Supreme Court has been held as this kind of separate institution above the fray, I worry that progressives don't recognize how much influence and power that court led by John Roberts and with Gorsuch and Kavanaugh and Co. can do. How much damage they can do to any - Bernie Sanders, let's say, gets elected as the first Socialist President of the United States in 2020. A lot of his agenda could be very easily blocked by this court. This is a court that almost got rid of Obamacare. It was one vote away from getting rid of the very moderate, very conservative Obamacare. The idea you could have medicare for all with this Supreme Court seems to be a pipe dream.\n\nWW: Well, this this court is about bolstering the concentration of power, right? That's what it's about. It's about making sure that corporations who have so much influence on our politics can remain influential in our political systems. That's really what it's about. It's about a lot of things. It's about the Chevron deference. It's about dismantling the administrative state. We could go on and on. We don't have a lot of time to do that.\n\nMH: But there's unfortunately a long list.\n\nWW: A long list.\n\nMH: In the short term Briahna in the short term given all those kind of structural impediments and factors, what do you think the Democrats should be doing now, this week like Monday?\n\nBJG: So two things: I actually do they should pursue impeachment. I think that the perjury case is good and that the goal shouldn't be necessarily whether or not it's going to work in terms of getting Kavanaugh off the bench. I think what it does, especially going into midterms, is establish that we are in this for principled reasons, not just for strategic reasons. Because that's the claim the Republicans always have back to us, right? \"You're not really in this. You don't really care about sexual assault. What you care about is keeping him off the bench.\" But there's a greater - there's another great principle in addition to sexual assault here, which is that this is a man who very clearly to most Americans, a majority of Americans, lied before the Senate and that, arguably, is a kind of a like a deeper more central corrosive presence to have on the Supreme Court and there's a very strong argument for that.\n\nBernie Sanders has been one of the few senators that's really been pretty consistent about this and he mentioned it again in his remarks last night and kind of, went through the list of what he felt were the most significant moments of perjury. And I also think it's important to keep this up over the next month or so because we're about to get all of the documents that were not disclosed about Kavanaugh prior to the hearing process. And if the Democrats have basically let this argument go by the time those documents come up, if they try to reinvigorate this argument, they're going to seem like johnny-come-lately's and that it's pretextual and of the moment's past.\n\nMH: So they don't let go of this, in your view?\n\nBJG: I don't think they should let go at this.\n\nWW: I totally agree if we win the House, the House Judiciary can open an investigation if they get the gavel. So if we are in a moment where we believe that we're likely to take the House in November, then we absolutely on the outside should be pushing to create the narrative that demands that the House Judiciary open an investigation into perjury because what do you have to lose? You either do nothing or you do something and if you're going to do something then you better be strategic about it.\n\nMH: And that's one of the issues that the Democrats have had, I guess, what the narrative is because rightly sexual assault has been at the center of the case against Kavanaugh. Some of the other cases against Kavanaugh which are equally disqualifying if not equally strong, the perjury case in particular, have kind of been lost along the way and bringing that back front and center is very important. Winnie, on the Democrats themselves, the Democrats in the Senate tried and failed to stop Kavanaugh from getting confirmed -\n\nWW: Did they try?\n\nMH: Well, that's - you beat me to my question. Did they try? Because some people say they didn't try hard enough or they didn't try. Others say come on, they're the minority party. You cannot blame a minority party for what the majority party was going to do anyways. Where do you stand?\n\nWW: Chuck Schumer showed an absolute lack of leadership in this moment. It's a crisis. Actually, it is a crisis in our democracy and he showed an utter lack of leadership. He rushed to confirm lots of conservative judges in the lower courts because he had to go away for a holiday which I find -\n\nBJG: Unconscionable.\n\nWW: Unconscionable, really. So he throughout this whole process, and I've been really - there is an inside-outside strategy right? Like this is not - the protests that you see wall-to-wall coverage on cable news, the photos that you see above the fold on every major paper across the country, these are organized protests. We have friends on the inside in the House and in the Senate who have been helpful, but they are not getting leadership. They're taking instruction from people like Linda Sarsour and I and that is, that's fine.\n\nI mean, I'm fine with that. But when I look at who they should be taking direction from, it's not from people like Chuck Schumer and they should be - he should be organizing his caucus inside. And that's actually not happening.\n\nMH: But if you look at, just to be fair, if you look at Senators like Harris, Booker, Hirono, they've done good work in recent weeks.\n\nWW: Sure, yeah, they've been hanging out with us. Harris has opened her office to us and she's like come on in and have a Cliff bar. You know, Senator Sanders has allowed us to use his interior conference room to you know, send out emails -\n\nMH: What could or should the Democrats have done that they didn't do? One thing for the listener who's not aware of the kind of inside-outside strategy.\n\nWW: I think that Chuck Schumer should have actually had a much more forward-facing narrative about why this nominee is bad and he really didn't do that. He didn't actually do that until we said he's bad and that started on September 3rd and 4th when we first went in and did these -\n\nMH: But just to be devil's advocate I agree with you, you know, I think the Democrats are always weak on these issues, but just to be devil's advocate - even if he had done that even, if he had been, you know, he'd been the most ardent opponent of Kavanaugh from the get-go and led his caucus much more strongly would that have stopped Joe Manchin from voting in favor of Kavanaugh? Would that have stopped Susan Collins from doing what she was always going to do?\n\nWW: Well, Susan Collins, I think was always going to vote with Kavanaugh because she is cozy with the Bush family, right? She's you know, she's - Brett Kavanaugh, let's call him who he is. He's an operative. He's a republican operative and a conservative ideologue. That's who he is and he's aligned with conservatives and she is the same. So she was always going to vote for him. Murkowski had an out and she probably negotiated that out and we don't have to get into that. But Manchin, I think if he had been whipped by Schumer could have voted with us and then we would have some more time.\n\nMH: For those of you who are not political anoraks Winnie's not calling for the literal physical whipping. Though some of us today may actually feel that way towards Joe Manchin.\n\nWW: If you live in West Virginia, you know where to go. No but -\n\nMH: No but, he's a disgrace. I read yesterday that he's even been on the record saying he would consider voting for Trump in 2020. I'm not sure how he gets to keep the Democrat label after this latest vote. Briahna, just before we finish when you look at the villains of this piece, the villains of the piece, who do you think, looking back over, the last few weeks is the number one villain? I know there's so many to choose from. I mean, I look at Grassley. I look at McConnell. There's obviously Collins and Flake, the fake moderates, who I wrote about for The Intercept today. Who do you think is the big villain of this piece?\n\nBJG: You know, I get a lot of flack for never - for punching center more than I punch right and I'm going to do it again right now because I don't have high standards for the people who are supposed to be doing what they're doing which are not follow my interest, you know. They're following their own. What my concern is, is that we knew that we were going to have a hearing, we knew that we're going to have questioning opportunities of five-minute intervals, and there wasn't - of all the prosecutors that we have in our bench nobody said, \"let's put together a questioning strategy where we all pick up the mantle where the last person went down, where we don't let Kavanaugh off the hook as he can equivocate for five minutes and never be pressed in any of these questions. We didn't set him up for opportunities for impeachment down the line. We didn't use his testimony and get other facts their due before this that we can impeach him with during the testimony.\" I'm concerned that we didn't make the case in advance that was going to put pressure on him and put pressure on Manchin and set up a moral argument to make them feel constrained in their choices.\n\nAnd I'm concerned now as I've been tweeting about recently that knowing that the FBI investigation was going to be inadequate and knowing how many people have spoken out to newspapers, et cetera, that they have information that wasn't questioned at all or wasn't looked into it at all, that the Democrats didn't take that opportunity to do their own investigation and make that information available to the American people.\n\nThey could have had a press conference that basically laid out for hours and hours and hours yesterday what the unheard narrative is, what all the facts are that we weren't able to see, whatever it was in that secret room, whatever the FBI report was that could have been contrasted starkly with the transparent Democratic investigation and that could have put a different kind of pressure on these Senators to do the right thing because a moral case had been made and they would not be able to fall on these arguments that \"Well, I couldn't prove conclusively that he did it so there must be nothing there.\" We could have shown that there was something there if there was that kind of political will but we haven't seen this kind of forward thinking or innovation from the Democratic party.\n\nMH: So last question to you both: given all of that do you think we're now going to see a change in the \"resistance\" to the Republicans? We've seen how ruthless the Republicans are. We know how ruthless they can be. They're not going to get any less ruthless. Are you optimistic about the Democrats getting a bit more of a backbone?\n\nWW: Well, I'm a registered independent and I'm pretty ruthless and so I have every intention of continuing to scale what we're doing now. We have a lot of plans that are going to be unveiled in the next days.\n\nMH: And Susan Collins is on your radar?\n\nWW: Susan Collins is on my radar. Yeah, we've raised you know, I think we've hit the three-million-dollar mark. The new goal is four million. There are matching funds. We are, you know, in a moment now where we understand that like we can actually like raise money from small-dollar donors and from ordinary people in the country to actually challenge these Republicans. We're not in any way feeling defeated. We're feeling more emboldened than ever before and that's really because we do have this inside-outside strategy now and I don't want to name all the Senators, Senator Sanders, who have been you know, who have been such great allies to the social forces on the outside led by people like myself and Linda Sarsour and others.\n\nWe are leading the Democratic institutions to become better actors. Like they're learning from us. They're saying this is a teachable moment. This is instruction that we want to take.\n\nMH: I hope you're right. Winnie Wong, Briahna Joy Gray, thank you both for joining me on Deconstructed.\n\nWW: Thank you.\n\nBJG: Thank you for having us.\n\n[musical interlude]\n\nMH: That was Briahna Joy Gray and Winnie Wong. Joining me now to talk about how women are reacting to this Brett Kavanaugh appointment and what his confirmation means for the MeToo movement in particular, is the world famous feminist writer and activist Naomi Wolf, author of the books The Beauty Myth and The End of America, among others, and CEO of The Daily Clout website.\n\nNaomi, thanks for joining me on Deconstructed.\n\nNaomi Wolf: It's a pleasure always to talk to you, Mehdi.\n\nMH: Naomi, I wish we weren't talking under these circumstances. first off. What was your reaction yesterday when you saw Susan Collins announce her yes vote on the senate floor and at that moment you knew like the rest of us that Kavanaugh had made it, he was heading to the Supreme Court. How did you feel?\n\nNW: It's hard to put that into words. I think, like a lot of people, I'm feeling a sense of you know, it's actually not shock. It's like - it's very much like Stockholm Syndrome where you know, you've been held captive, held captive, held captive and then you finally think justice is going to be done. And I don't mean like a preordained outcome, I mean just like a real FBI investigation, a real hearing from witnesses, a taking seriously of claims of sexual assault against women and your heart just starts to lift that little bit and you think you know where I'm going to move with the rest of the country into a place where the horrible past is behind us.\n\nAnd then it's like the lid gets slammed right down on you and you're back in your prison cell and nothing's going to change. That's sort of how I feel.\n\nMH: Yeah, and you preempted - my next question was going to be what message does the Kavanaugh confirmation send to women in America? And it's that, isn't it? That nothing's going to change. It's almost a year to the day, I think, yesterday was at the one-year anniversary of the New York Times story on Harvey Weinstein, which kicked off the whole MeToo phenomenon. And it's so depressing to mark the first anniversary with this vote.\n\nNW: Yeah, I mean, I mean, words - I'm sorry. I keep stammering because like words almost fail what a gigantic confrontation with kind of the third rail of patriarchy this is. You know, I was just thinking where is Weinstein? He's not in prison. It's been a year and there's been no trial. He's a free man. Like if there's - there have been so many eye witnesses coming forward and the guy's not even in custody. So you know, in this in this particular case, I guess what's incredibly depressing is and I speak as a rape survivor, sadly, but you know, there are so many millions and millions and billions of us around the world, what was so depressing about this is that the spectacle came into kind of the center, like ground zero of power in our system and ground zero of the law, right? And the Bar Association like - what I try always to remind people Mehdi is that rape and sexual assault should not be dragged as they so often are into the realm of culture or you know gender misunderstandings.\n\nMH: Politics.\n\nNW: Yeah, these are crimes. They're violent crimes and the law actually understands better than culture does that when someone touches someone else sexually against their will, that is sexual assault in most states, right? There doesn't have to be bruises. There doesn't have to be like, you know blood shed. That's sexual assault as the law defines it in most states.\n\nAnd so here's you know, these accounts coming into the realm of law. And here's - the thing that worries me most - is here's an FBI investigation. This is you know, this is law enforcement. This is not a political agency. It's police right? It's domestic law enforcement. And at the end of it the three eyewitnesses who were claimed to have been in the room were not interviewed as far as we know, right? The two principles were not interviewed as I understand it and I'm not aware that Mark Judge was interviewed.\n\nMH: Judge was interview, I believe. But Ford and Kavanaugh were not, bizarrely. Kavanaugh wasn't re-interviewed, which is a very, very odd move. You mentioned the third rail of patriarchy, has there ever been a better ad for the existence of patriarchy, of white male privilege, of a culture of impunity here in the U.S. than these confirmation hearings?\n\nI mean if Christine Blasey Ford had gotten as emotional, as angry, as rude as Kavanaugh did in his testimony, can you imagine the response? I mean, she would have been destroyed wouldn't she by politicians and the press?\n\nNW: Yeah, I think that's pretty clear and the same kind of double standard applies to race, you know, if an African American man or women actually not backed by the Republicans because Thomas - Justice Clarence Thomas actually did get quite emotional but he was on the script. Yeah, we're not allowed to have that kind of rage without being called hysterical but I don't think that's news.\n\nMH: You have women being arrested outside Senate offices this week. We have a spike in the number of women calling rape crisis hotlines to report their assault. Has this whole Kavanaugh episode not only angered a lot of American women but radicalized them too in a good way? I'm using radicalized in a good way, that say \"You know what? We're not going to tolerate this anymore.\"\n\nNW: I mean, that's great. You know, I tweeted that I really like, a part of me really likes seeing, you know, women screaming at people defending alleged abusers in public. It's like six millennia overdue. I've no problem with that and as a survivor, I think that it's you know, really healthy for this not to be a dirty little secret anymore. And for women and men - because 17 percent of sexual abuse survivors are men - to be out in the streets, you know, screaming and shouting about this violent, violent crime and the impunity of rapists, the impunity of molesters and harassers and gang rapists.\n\nAnd you know, when I heard Susan Collins, there's a part of you that kind of goes numb or goes dead. You know, it's a very, I mean, trauma lasts forever, right? And when your abuser is, or you know, the crime itself is held up by the most powerful people in your society and they basically say \"nothing you do will make this, make this change, you know, we're going to defend the abusers. We're going to say that your truth is a smear campaign, you know, nothing is going to move the dial. No one's going to protect you. Right? No one's going to protect your daughters and sons.\"\n\nI guess what I'm saying is in addition to the kind of rage and protest and God bless people are getting arrested. You know, it's the right thing to get arrested for. I don't want to downplay the grief and despair and sense of hopelessness, you know, that a lot of survivors are feeling right now. You know I can say that from personal experience it's very hard to move ahead or even like get out of, you know, want to do anything if your whole culture says you're not safe and the injury done to you doesn't matter.\n\nMH: I'm so sorry to hear you say that and it's painful to hear.\n\nNW: Thank you.\n\nMH: Where do the Democrats go from here, Naomi? What can they do now to try and give hope to those of us, and especially survivors of assault, who are feeling so dejected today?\n\nNW: I think what's very sad, but predictable about this is that the Democrats always misunderstand that you know, Trump is speaking to his base and his base, you know - It's a win like for Trump to be mocking the accuser just like it's a win, you know, dog whistle politics or wolf whistle politics, you know. We have to look at who we've become. A chunk of America is deeply racist, deeply homophobic, deeply misogynist and they're just fine. And so basically, the Democrats always make the same mistake over and over - well, they make many of the same mistakes over and over but one of them is they think everyone thinks like them and that everyone can be persuaded by the same kind of reason that they think is right.\n\nMH: And you were an adviser to Bill Clinton and Al Gore back in the mid-1990s. Do you think the Democrats lost the moral high ground by never really owning the fact that one of their own Presidents had a pretty shoddy record when it came to sexual misconduct, to abuse of power in terms of sexual relations with employees, even the alleged rape case, Juanita Broaddrick. The fact that Trump tried to weaponize those accusers against Hillary in 2016 doesn't change the fact that Democrats never really had a reckoning over Bill's pretty dodgy record with women. Did they, Naomi?\n\nNW: Yeah I'm really glad you said that. You're exactly right. I mean the Democrats have no credibility at all on so many issues because of their partisanship, right? The same is true of surveillance, you know, privacy issues, police brutality issues. When Obama was in power all the violations, terrible whistleblower abuses, you know around civil liberties got worse, but Democrats didn't care because their guy was in power. And now we reap what we've sown. There were like six voices in America on the left, you know, Glenn Greenwald. I'm proud to say I think I was one of them, you know, like but very vanishingly few - Amy Goodman - who were critical of those violations, you know, when \"our guy\" was in power and yeah, the same is true with with Clinton. I was one of like - I was the only feminist I know in the 90s and 2000s who was you know, not going to downplay the accusations against Bill Clinton by so many women. And I guess what people need to understand about politics is that something can be real and weaponized at the same time. In other words just because Juanita Broaddrick was backed and supported and maybe housed in hotels and you know, given talking points by Republican operatives doesn't mean she shouldn't have had her claims investigated.\n\nOf course, we're never going to gain the - I shouldn't say \"we\" because I'm an independent by now because I'm so disgusted with both sides, but the Democrats will never gain what they desperately need, which is swing voters to win anything unless they're willing to show some moral consistency across party lines.\n\nMH: On that note, Naomi, we will have to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining me.\n\nNW: Thank you so much Medhi. I appreciate your call.\n\n[musical interlude]\n\nMH: That was the best-selling author, writer and activist Naomi Wolf. Talking about Brett Kavanaugh. It's all we've been talking about for weeks now. And I suspect we're not going to stop talking about it anytime soon. Nor should we. As Ryan, Briahna, Winnie and Naomi all agreed, there's no longer even a pretense anymore: the Supreme Court is clearly a barrier, an obstacle to the left, to the Democrats, to progressive politics, to democracy itself, and it has to now be treated as such. Brett Kavanaugh is not an impartial disinterested judge, he's a Republican political operative wearing black robes. Ready to strike down and roll back every major progressive law or policy that you can think of. And if that doesn't make you mad, if that doesn't make you start thinking long and hard about court packing, or term limits, about fighting fire with fire, and above all else, about going out to vote in November, so that a progressive-led House and Senate can stand up to future Brett Kavanaughs, and maybe even impeach this one, then I don't know what will.\n\nThat's our show on a day that history was made.

      "text": "The Unbearable Stupidity of Howard Schultz's Presidential Fantasy\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe former Starbucks CEO, a charisma-free zone, would help re-elect Trump. Plus, he's lying about taxes and \"Medicare for All.\"\n\nThe former chair and CEO of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, speaks during a presentation on his book \"From the Ground Up\" on Jan. 28, 2019 in New York City.\n\nIs this a joke?\n\nBillionaire Howard Schultz is considering running for president of the United States. The ex-Starbucks CEO and former owner of the Seattle SuperSonics, who has zero experience in government or politics, thinks Donald Trump is \" not qualified \" to be commander-in-chief.\n\nTo misquote Phoebe Buffay from \"Friends\": \"Hello, kettle? This is Howard. You're black.\"\n\nIf Trump is \"not qualified,\" then what the hell is Schultz? In all fairness to the pretend president, Trump is able to command crowds and attention like no other politician on the right. His name recognition was off the charts when he ran in the Republican primaries in 2016. The former Starbucks boss, on the other hand, is a charisma-free zone ; the only crowds he seems to attract are his humiliating Twitter ratios .\n\nThe truth is that despite claiming to be \"bored\" by Trump, and voicing his opposition to the president's \"vitriolic display of bigotry and hate and divisiveness,\" Schultz has far more in common with the reality star-turned-POTUS than he might like to admit. His Trumpian ego has made him - an old, rich white guy who got rich selling coffee! - think he can be Leader of the Free WorldTM.\n\nDeconstructed Podcast\n\nThere's also his Trumpian dishonesty. Schultz, the \" lifelong Democrat ,\" has spent the past few days hurling a series of false accusations not against Trump, but against Democrats. He attacked Sen. Kamala Harris's support for \"Medicare for All\" as \"not American,\" which is absurd given that Medicare itself has been around for more than 50 years, while \"Medicare for All\" is polling at 70 percent , with majority support even among Republicans.\n\nHe claimed that the \"majority of Americans\" are opposed to \"a 70 percent income tax in America,\" as suggested by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Another lie. A recent Hill-HarrisX survey found that 59 percent of voters support the Ocasio-Cortez tax proposal (which only applies to income over $10 million), including a clear majority of independents.\n\nSchultz also said that \"the greatest threat domestically to the country is this $21 trillion debt hanging over the cloud of America and future generations.\" Again, false. A number of leading economists disagree with him on the debt. And, as HuffPost's Zach Carter points out, \"his $21.5 trillion debt monster is an exaggeration: It includes trillions of dollars the government owes to itself.\" (Oh, and for the record, a whopping 2 percent of Americans cite the federal debt as \"the most important problem facing the country today.\")\n\nThere's the Trumpian stinginess too. According to an investigation by The Young Turks , in 2017, Schultz donated less than 1 percent of his $3.4 billion net worth to his own charity. \"All told,\" reported TYT, \"Schultz has given an estimated two-and-a-half percent of his wealth to the family nonprofit, based on tax filings dating back to 1999.\" Sound familiar ?\n\nThe former Starbucks CEO doesn't like paying higher taxes, either. Schultz, the self-styled deficit hawk, isn't opposed to Trump's deficit-busting tax cuts - only the size of them . He has lambasted Sen. Elizabeth Warren's new proposal for a wealth tax as \"ridiculous.\" Should we be surprised? As a billionaire himself, he'd have to pay a 3 percent wealth tax , according to the Warren plan.\n\nHis beloved overpriced coffee chain doesn't have a much better record on taxation. In 2017, Starbucks's European division paid a mere $5.9 million in taxes , on U.K. profits of $213 million - or an effective tax rate of just 2.8 percent.\n\nThen there's the Trumpian ignorance. The self-deprecating Schultz, unlike the president, is willing to concede that he is not the \"smartest person in the room.\" That may be an understatement, though. For a start, why does he think he has any chance of winning the presidency in 2020? What's his route to victory in a two-party system? Schultz, the political neophyte, does not even understand how presidential candidates get on the ballot. He thinks that polls showing that 4 in 10 Americans identify as \"independents\" means his own independent presidential campaign will attract widespread support - when reams of evidence suggest that self-styled independents are (closet) partisans. \"Only about 7 percent of people who identify as independents truly don't like either party,\" reported NPR on Tuesday, citing research from political scientist Samara Klar, author of the book \"Independent Politics.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nSchultz, it seems, is Trump without the tan, the bluster, or the border wall. And if he decides to run in 2020, his independent candidacy, to quote former Obama strategist David Axelrod, will be a \" gift \" to the Republican incumbent - potentially splitting the anti-Trump vote and giving this racist disaster of a president another four years in the Oval Office.\n\nGuess who agrees?\n\nTeam Trump. Consider the president's very deliberate tweet on Monday, goading the coffee mogul to enter the 2020 race as an independent:\n\nHoward Schultz doesn't have the \"guts\" to run for President! Watched him on @60Minutes last night and I agree with him that he is not the \"smartest person.\" Besides, America already has that! I only hope that Starbucks is still paying me their rent in Trump Tower!\n\n- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2019\n\nConsider also the very deliberate praise heaped on Schultz by the likes of Hugh Hewitt and the hosts of \" Fox and Friends .\"\n\nIs there a way, then, of dissuading the ill-informed, egomaniacal Schultz from burning through hundreds of millions of dollars on a pointless, Trump-boosting presidential campaign? Will op-eds like this work? How about a consumer boycott of Starbucks? Maybe more protests at his book-signing events? Kudos, in fact, to the protester who heckled Schultz at a Barnes & Noble in New York on Monday evening, summarizing the case against him in eight pithy words: \" Don't help elect Trump, you egotistical billionaire asshole .\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have?

Now we're printing her words in full.\n\nEarchiel Lee Johnson / People's World\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAfter her commencement address at Hampshire College, author and Princeton University professor Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor endured a campaign of intimidation and abuse when alt-right media websites, followed by Fox News, smeared the views she expressed. After receiving threats of violence through the Internet and in person, Taylor decided to cancel a speech for Town Hall Seattle, scheduled for early June, on racism in the Trump era in early June. \"The cancellation of my speaking events is a concession to the violent intimidation that was, in my opinion, provoked by Fox News,\" Taylor wrote in a statement. \"But I am releasing this statement to say that I will not be silent.\"\n\nOn July 6, in defiance of the racist harassment, Taylor gave the speech she couldn't in Seattle - at the Socialism 2017 conference in Chicago. Here we are printing the text of that speech as a co-publication of Socialist Worker, Jacobin, and the International Socialist Review , three co-sponsors of the conference. Taylor has been a contributor to these publications among many others, and is the author of From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation .\n\nObviously, they don't mind illegals coming in. They don't mind drugs pouring in. They don't mind, excuse me, MS-13 coming in. We're getting them all out of here . . . Members of Congress who will be voting on border security have a simple choice: They can either vote to help drug cartels and criminal aliens trying to enter the United States, like, frankly, the Democrats are doing. Or they can vote to help American citizens and American families be safe. That's the choice. Who do you want to represent you? We're finding the illegal immigrant drug dealers, gang members and killers, and removing them from our country. And once they are gone, folks - you see what we're doing - they will not let them back in. They're not coming back.\n\n- Donald Trump, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, April 29, 2017\n\nThe free world...all of Christendom . . . is at war with Islamic horror. Not a single radicalized Islamic suspect should be granted any measure of quarter. Their intended entry to the American homeland should be summarily denied. Every conceivable measure should be engaged to hunt them down. Hunt them, identify them, and kill them. Kill them all. For the sake of all that is good and righteous. Kill them all.\n\n- US Rep. Clay Higgins, Louisiana Republican, June 5, 2017\n\nYou cannot rebuild your civilization with somebody else's babies. You've got to keep your birth rate up, and you need to teach your children your values.\n\n- US Rep. Steve King, Iowa Republican, March 13, 2017\n\nThe fantasy-fueled discussion that the election of Barack Obama in 2008 ushered the United States into a post-racial period has come to a stark and dramatic end. Far from post-racial, what we are seeing at the highest ranks of government is open fawning toward white supremacist and white nationalist ideas and politics.\n\nThe Ku Klux Klan and David Duke endorsed Donald Trump. His candidacy was met with enthusiasm from white supremacists, neo-Nazis and other organized racist hate groups. Steve Bannon, a self-described architect of the so-called \"alt-right,\" is Trump's chief strategist and has an office in the White House. It is not hyperbole to say that white supremacy is resting at the heart of American politics.\n\nAnd it is a deadly serious matter. It can be measured by the weight of the bodies of those, known and unknown, who have paid the price for the normalization and sanctification of racism, bigotry, and hatred in this country.\n\nRicky John Best. Taliesin Myrddin Namkai Meche. Richard W. Collins III. Nabra Hassanen. Srinivas Kuchibhotla.\n\nSince the election of Donald Trump, people who may have been considered the racist fringe have been emboldened and activated to engage in intimidation, violence, and even murder. From Washington, DC, to Portland, Oregon, from the East Coast to the West, racist violence has been documented.\n\nIn the ten days after Trump was elected, there were nine hundred reported incidents of hate crimes. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, in 40 percent of those cases, Trump's name was used when victims were attacked.\n\nBetween January and March of this year, the Council on American Islamic Relations received 1,597 complaints. Of the verified reports, nearly half involved abuse by representatives of federal agencies. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Department of Homeland Security officers were implicated in 23 percent of those complaints.\n\nCampuses of all varieties have been targeted for racist hate speech. Between November and the end April, there were racist incidents at 284 primary and secondary schools and 330 incidents on college campuses. These numbers did not include a flurry of neo-Nazi and other racist posters that went up in the weeks after the election and then during Black History Month in February.\n\nThe right views college campuses as sites of political struggle. At its national meeting in April, the National Rifle Association's vice president, Wayne LaPierre, said, \"It's up to us to speak up against the three most dangerous voices in America: academic elites, political elites, and media elites. These are America's greatest domestic threats.\"\n\nIts no coincidence, then, that college campuses and universities are under attack by groups like the NRA and right-wing media sites that publicize and more fully articulate their agenda. Part of the attack includes trolling students and faculty members - parsing closely every word they write or say and then deliberately twisting and distorting those views to egg on and fuel their readerships and viewerships. In effect, right-wing media, in particular, organize racist and sexist cyber-mob attacks not just on faculty members of color, but they specifically target any faculty who speak out against racism.\n\nCampuses have become easy targets for manipulative campaigns aimed at scaring administrators into admonishing, but more importantly disciplining, or if possible firing radical and left-wing faculty. When administrators act in this way, it is an act of surrender that will not bring quiet, but feeds the mob and invites a continuation of these orchestrated attacks.\n\nAnd it is orchestrated . Fox News published a story - based on a story originally published by Campus Reform - about my commencement address at Hampshire College. In my opinion, both news organizations published the story with the intention of activating a racist mob made up of its readers and viewers. Fox ran various news stories about my nineteen-minute speech four days in a row over a holiday weekend.\n\nAs a result, I received fifty-four e-mails in a span of five days. Here is some of the content of those e-mails:\n\n\"would not piss in your mouth if you were dying of thirst, lib bitch FUCK YOU, FUCK LIBS\"\n\n\"I read about your nasty tirade against the president.. Have you ever, just for a moment, considered counseling, a good shrink, or if all else fails, a .44 round to the brain?\"\n\n\"If Trump is what you say, you are a dirty ass coon dyke cunt. Jus sayin...Cunt..\"\n\n\"Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor is a stupid FUCKING NIGGER!!! Burn in HELL Nigger!!\"\n\n\"Saw your tirade bout Mr. TRUMP...u like your isms, \"race ism, corp ism,\" and so on. Be clear, what you preach is 105 percent NIGGER ISM...fuck you and your hate speech!\"\n\n\"Hey nigger keep you keep talking down on the President of the United States we will try you in federal court for hate crimes and have you lynched\"\n\nFor the right wing, it's not just the thrill of victory in humiliating weak administrators, but there is the agenda of isolating, intimidating and ultimately silencing radical faculty, staff, and students. The university is one of the few places in this country where, if you are a faculty member, you can freely express your politics and radical ideas.\n\nThe Right seeks to kill that atmosphere while simultaneously benefitting from it. If nothing else, the right wing recognizes that part of the political struggle is the battle over ideas. That is why alt-right, neo-Nazi Richard Spencer was on a campus speaking tour in the spring that will resume in the fall.\n\nThe Right doesn't want to just have fistfights over its presence on campus, though they love the free attention that comes with it - but they actually do want to speak on campus. They believe that their ideas can get a hearing. And make no mistake about it, they can get a hearing on campus and off campus.\n\nBut the onslaught of racism and repression are not just about hate speech, about the racist cyber mob or nasty fliers placed on campuses. It has real implications when those sentiments are reflected in the government itself. It leads to violent attacks. It has led to murder.\n\nAnd it has to be organized against in numbers that demonstrate that they are a minority and our side - the side against racism, murder, and the terrorism of the right wing in this country - is the majority. They are confident right now because our side has yet to mobilize in a way that reflects that we are the majority.\n\nBut the violence of the Right is obviously not the only problem. The most profound and dangerous aspects of the Trump agenda can be found in the growing list of policy initiatives to remove regulatory protections while emboldening agents of the state to act against oppressed and exploited individuals across this country.\n\nIn other words, the actions of the racist fringe have been amplified in the policies of the Trump administration. Consider as a single example the case of Jean Carlos Jiménez-Joseph.\n\nJiménez-Joseph, a twenty-seven-year old black Panamanian immigrant, was taken into custody by ICE in March. He was placed in solitary confinement for nineteen days after he hopped from a second-floor landing to a first-floor landing, instead of using the stairs, breaking the detention facility's rules.\n\nAfter spending nineteen days in solitary confinement, he hung himself. When officials in the private detention center where he was held found him, an ambulance was called, and he was driven to a hospital thirty-five miles away, where he was pronounced.\n\nIn the first one hundred days of the Trump administration, ICE has arrested more than forty-one thousand people - a 37 percent increase over the same time period last year. ICE agents are arresting, on average, four hundred immigrants a day. Some eleven thousand of those immigrants had no criminal record at all.\n\nThe Muslim travel ban, in combination with a policy of endless war across the Middle East, underpins an unrelenting campaign against Muslims led by the Trump administration.\n\nThe group of people who may ultimately absorb the brunt of Trump's policy changes are African American. Black people suffer from disproportionate poverty and certainly from racism in this country. As a result, African Americans have historically called upon the federal state to intervene to defend against racial discrimination that runs rampant in the private sector.\n\nBecause black people have been poorer because of discrimination, we have relied on the federal state to improve conditions through vigorous defense of existing civil rights legislation as protection against discrimination, while also pursuing affirmative policies aimed at lifting and improving the material conditions of black citizens.\n\nThe efforts to dismantle the \"administrative state,\" as Steve Bannon puts its, will have a devastating impact on those who need those protections. This is clear in the Department of Education, where officials seem to be avoiding even platitudes professing a commitment to racial equality in education.\n\nIt certainly applies to the misnamed Department of Justice, where the administration is calling for an official return to the kinds of law-and-order policies that created the conditions of \"mass incarceration\" by rationalizing racial profiling as a crime-fighting tool and signaling to police departments across the country that there will be no pretense of reform or oversight - and that they are empowered to harass, arrest, beat, detain, and even kill whomever they choose.\n\nThese moves are known and understood by many, but the rollback of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) protections is just as dangerous.\n\nBlack and Latino communities live in closer proximity to toxins, whether in the form of poor air quality, abandoned industrial sites, active industrial sites, highways or railroads, and more. As a result, nearly half of Latinos live in counties that do not meet EPA air quality standards, for example.\n\nThe Flint water crisis has tellingly demonstrated the intersection of racial discrimination and environmental degradation. It is not only evident in the fact that city officials allowed Flint's water supply to have dangerous levels of lead, while doing nothing to clean it up.\n\nBut when a city employee in Flint was asked about the water crisis, he said, \"Flint has the same problems as Detroit - fucking niggers don't pay their bills, believe me, I deal with them.\" This wasn't a public official, but given the fact that Flint's water is still polluted today, it would not be difficult to envision a public official saying the same thing.\n\nThese are the three components of Trump's racial regime: anti-immigrant hysteria, Islamophobia, and anti-black racism.\n\nBut racism in America is never just about racism for racism's sake. It is always in the service of a larger agenda.\n\nIn the case of Trump it is obvious. It is no coincidence that the racism animating much of Trump's politics accompanies a harsh and draconian economic agenda intended to gut the living standards of the entire working class.\n\nIn other words, Trump and the Republican Party explain the inequality experienced by workers - white workers in particular - as the fault of Mexican immigrants who steal jobs; or the fault of black criminals who make us unsafe; or the fault of Muslim terrorists who make us spend billions on defense. And meanwhile, they pursue policies intended to destroy the living standards of those same workers.\n\nThe ruling elite doubled down on the idea that the least powerful among us is responsible for the hardship experienced by millions in this country - while the rich white millionaires and billionaires at the helm of the government are innocent bystanders.\n\nDuring the campaign, this was not just an appeal to white workers - Trump used scapegoating to appeal to black workers as well. Donald Trump's campaign drafted a \"New Deal\" for black America, which included a ten-point plan. Number seven of that plan was a crackdown on \"illegal immigration.\" Trump's campaign website explained:\n\nNo group has been more economically harmed by decades of illegal immigration than low-income African American workers ...We will suspend reckless refugee admissions from terror-prone regions that cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. We will use a portion of the money saved by enforcing our laws and suspending refugees to reinvested in our inner cities.\n\nScapegoating and lies: the essential ingredients of the Trump candidacy and now the Trump presidency.\n\nBut here is where the cynicism of both liberals and the right converge. Both think very little of ordinary people - the much-maligned working class.\n\nOn the Right, they believe that a steady diet of racism and war is enough to satisfy the appetite of working-class white people. This is what Kellyanne Conway meant when she got into a post-election argument with Clinton surrogates and sneered, \"Do you think you could have just had a decent message for white, working-class voters?\" It is also what Donald Trump meant when he bragged that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York and not lose any support.\n\nAmong liberals is a similar attitude, in which ordinary white workers are boorish Neanderthals who eat and drink racism, bathe in their privilege, and are an unchanging ignorant bulwark against any and all progress in the United States.\n\nOf course, what has been lost in this stultifying picture of race, class, and consciousness is that the bulk of Trump's support did not come white working-class people. According to the most recent reports, only a third of Trump voters made less than the national median income of $50,000. Another third made between $50,000 and $100,000, and another third made over $100,000. According to one study, Trump received one in four votes from whites without a college degree making under $50,000 a year.\n\nThe two main things that stand out about the election are: one, Trump lost the election by more than three million votes. And two, tens of millions of people did not vote. There are 238 million eligible voters in the United States, and slightly more than half of them voted. That means that more than 120 million people did not vote.\n\nOf course, we know that the Republican Party continues to try and find ways to strip black voters of their right to vote, but there is an even bigger reason for such a dramatically low turnout. Neither party offers a serious attempt to grapple with the vicious inequality that exists in this country. They used to say, \"There is no alternative\" to the status quo and to inequality. Now we can look at them and say, \"They have no solutions.\"\n\nThose people who continue to insist that we give our support to the Democratic Party while getting nothing in return have lost touch with reality. The reason that 120 million people did not vote in last year's election is quite simple: tens of millions of ordinary people do not believe it is capable of delivering the changes that are necessary to make their lives better. You cannot run a candidate who is a millionaire and who collects speaking fees from the most powerful banks in the country on Monday and then turn around and insist she's for ordinary and working-class people on Tuesday.\n\nBarack Obama promised to change Washington. He promised hope and tens of millions of people believed him. And then we experienced eight years of the status quo, and in some cases, worse than that.\n\nAngrily repeating that Trump is worse - and he undoubtedly is in every way - won't change the fact that people want something to vote for - and simply saying that they are not Trump or the Republicans is not enough. What are you for?\n\nInstead of grappling with this issue, the Democratic Party stays transfixed on Russia. The mass media is obsessed with finding the smoking gun that finally connects Trump to some Russia scandal.\n\nMeanwhile, they ignore the ongoing assault on working-class life and living standards in this country. They turn the hardships and anxieties of white working-class people into a caricature to explain their supposedly unquestioned support of Trump, while simultaneously ignoring the hardships and anxieties of black working-class life altogether.\n\nHow else do we make sense of the utterly vapid commentary from the Trump administration in response to the crisis of guns and violence in black communities across Chicago?\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the spokesperson for Trump - if you can imagine a worst lot in life - said last week that shootings in Chicago were an issue of morality. It was as callous as it is ignorant. But it is also the exact same thing the Rahm Emanuel and Barack Obama have said for years, whether it was Obama complaining about the absence of role models in black working-class neighborhoods or Emanuel blaming black parents.\n\nWhat none of these elected officials will do is tell the truth: that poor and working-class African Americans in Chicago have been abused and abandoned. Through a combination of public policy and the private actions of banks, real estate brokers and universities on both ends of this city, residential segregation has been entrenched and enforced for almost one hundred years.\n\nSegregation has created substandard and inferior housing. It has cut black people off from the best jobs. It has strangled public schools, public hospitals, libraries, parks, and clinics of desperately needed resources. It has isolated and demoralized young and old. Fifty percent of young black men in Chicago aged twenty to twenty-four are not in school nor are they employed - 35 percent of black women in the same age group are also unemployed and out of school.\n\nThese are structural and institutional problems created by an absence of human and material resources. And this is the exact reason why the political and economic establishments cling to their explanations that blame and punish. What would it mean to tell the truth about the real reasons behind the social crisis in Chicago and in every city around this country?\n\nIt would mean two things. It would explode the myths that capitalism and its free market can actually end poverty and suffering through privatized provision. And second, it would require that they do something about these material conditions, rather than ignore them. Put simply, structural problems demand structural answers. Instead, in Chicago and across the country, human need is met with cruel shouts of \"personal responsibility\" and policing, policing, and more policing.\n\nOf course, we will see the full-throated revival of rhetoric like \"culture of poverty\" because it has always been a way of blaming the victims of free-market capitalism, instead of looking at a system that has produced poverty, misery, and human suffering on scales that seem unimaginable in a world as rich as this one. How do they get away with it? They blame the victims for their hardship, and they get everyone to believe it.\n\nAnd it is not only black and brown people who experience this. As more ordinary white people become visible markers of the failure of capitalism, conservatives increasingly blame white poverty and social crisis - most notably drug addiction - on a morality crisis.\n\nIn Charles Murray's book Coming Apart: The State of White America , he blames declines in white working-class living standards on high divorce rates, out-of-wedlock births, dwindling church attendance, and men who can't hold jobs. Murray, of course, became infamous by insisting that disproportionate rates of poverty in black working class communities were because of biological differences between blacks and whites. He rehashes these ideas to analyze white poverty and also concludes that low IQ and biology are factors - but instead of between blacks and whites, the biological differences are between rich and poor white people.\n\nThe much lauded but underwhelming Hillbilly Elegy also argues that white Appalachian poverty is driven by poor choices behavior and morality, and not material deprivation. But perhaps the most succinct contempt for poor and working-class white people came from an article published in National Review :\n\nIf you spend time in hardscrabble, white upstate New York, or eastern Kentucky, or my own native West Texas, and you take an honest look at the welfare dependency, the drug and alcohol addiction, the family anarchy - which is to say, the whelping of human children with all the respect and wisdom of a stray dog - you will come to an awful realization. It wasn't Beijing. It wasn't even Washington, as bad as Washington can be ... Nothing happened to them. There wasn't some awful disaster. There wasn't a war or a famine or a plague or a foreign occupation. Even the economic changes of the past few decades do very little to explain the dysfunction and negligence - and the incomprehensible malice - of poor white America.\n\nThe truth about these dysfunctional, downscale communities is that they deserve to die. Economically, they are negative assets. Morally, they are indefensible. The white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious, selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles. Donald Trump's speeches make them feel good. So does OxyContin.\n\nOf course, liberals don't provide a credible alternative to this uniquely American cruelty when they parrot the same contempt by reducing the experiences of ordinary white people to \"privilege\" in ways that do not resemble and certainly do not make sense of the actual experiences of working-class white people.\n\nThere are twenty million poor white people in this country. The imprisonment of white women is \"surging,\" according to recent reports, because of growing alcohol abuse and drug addiction.\n\nLife in poor and working-class white enclaves is increasingly defined by economic insecurity, alcoholism, and opioid addiction. And while it is important to point out how elected officials are very willing to paint a sympathetic picture of opioid addiction as a health care issue and not a criminal issue, as they did with the crack phenomenon in the 1980s and 1990s - because opioids affect white people and crack was centered in Black neighborhoods - I would caution against believing all of that rhetoric that opioid addicts are getting loving care from the government.\n\nFor example, in Middletown, Ohio, a town of fifty thousand people that is 87 percent white and where 532 people died of opioid overdose last year, a member of the city council has proposed that drug addicts get two opportunities for medical treatment in the event of an overdose - but if there is a third call for an ambulance or medical treatment because of overdose, there should be no response. The councilman says the drug is too expensive at thirty-six dollars a dose.\n\nThis is not white privilege. This is capitalism in its most savage form.\n\nThe point of this is not to deny that racism exists among working-class and poor white people. It obviously does. Not all working-class white people voted for Trump but millions did.\n\nSo the point is to not deny the reality of the depths of racism in our society - it is to understand why it exists and the conditions under which it can be challenged and changed. Of course, it is easy to uniformly dismiss ordinary white workers as hopeless racists, but in doing so, we uniformly give up on the chance or potential to build a genuine mass movement that can fundamentally change this country.\n\nIn a country where public officials readily serve up racist explanations for social and economic inequality, it should not be surprising when those ideas take hold. Of course, not everyone readily accepts racism to explain their life circumstances - most people just blame themselves and the people they know in their families or neighborhoods for their troubles.\n\nBut there is a difference between people's perception of reality and reality itself. Even when ordinary white people buy into the idea that the stagnation in their standard of living is because of the presence of immigrants or because the presidency of Barack Obama improved the standard of living of blacks at their expense, that doesn't actually make it true.\n\nBut it takes more than an assertion or argument to convince people that their perceptions are not reality. So when well-meaning people suggest that the way white radicals can fight racism is to talk to their racist uncle or father-in-law at Thanksgiving, it is both a sign of the low expectations of the antiracist movement, but it also reveals the extent to which people accept that racism is just bad ideas that someone can be talked into or out of.\n\nOf course, political argument is crucial, but it actually matters what you are saying. It takes radical politics and struggle to uncover the true nature of any society, but especially one like ours, where the political establishment regularly uses rhetoric, lies, and distortions to cloud the truth.\n\nFor example, the social eruption of Occupy Wall Street helped to lay bare how the wealthy live at the expense of everyone else, with the simple yet extraordinarily clarifying idea of the 1 percent versus the 99 percent.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement helped to expose the systemic and routine ways that police abuse and violence shape the social reality in Black communities. Despite the efforts of the Trump administration and the misnamed Department of Justice, led by Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, to return to an era of mass incarceration of African Americans, millions of people, including white people, have had their consciousness change about the police.\n\nTen years ago, the immigrant rights movement brought millions of undocumented immigrants onto the streets and challenged the right wing's efforts to criminalize their existence. Their struggle gave us the slogans \"No human is illegal\" and \"Undocumented and unafraid.\"\n\nThe Dakota Access Pipeline struggle made the powerful connection between land rights of the indigenous and the need for and access to clean, unadulterated water. It also demonstrated what it means to struggle, and how struggle can transform an impossible situation into a winnable one.\n\nOf course, none of these examples has been enough to completely transform the circumstances or conditions they have exposed. And how could they? Racism is the lifeblood of American capitalism. We cannot end racism and the inequality it produces within capitalism. It means that even when we move forward, the political and economic establishment responds quickly with their best effort to return life to the way it was.\n\nWe don't necessarily forget our victories or forward movement right away, but unless there is an active effort to assess those victories, draw lessons from them, and quickly transform those lessons into new strategies and tactics for moving forward, it is all too easy to regress.\n\nNo movement is guaranteed success simply by existing. We will not win just because we believe that our side is right. We have to know what it is we are fighting for, and we have to openly debate and strategize our way forward. And most of all, we have to be involved in protests and demonstrations and building social movements to win concessions from the political and economic establishment.\n\nThis is all true, but at some point in the feverish effort to build the next movement, and then the next movement, and the next and the next - we must ask: What is wrong with a society, an economic and political system, that will make you beg, fight and struggle for the basic rights of existence?\n\nWhy do we have to struggle for affordable housing when everyone knows that the human species cannot live without proper shelter? Why is housing not a right?\n\nWhy do we have to struggle for health care when everyone knows that the human species cannot continue without proper medical care? Why is health care not a right?\n\nWhy do we have to struggle for a living wage just so we can afford the ever-growing cost of food when everyone knows that our species cannot live without food?\n\nWhy do we have to struggle against corporate America's insistence on polluting the air we breath, the water we drink, and the food we eat?\n\nThe list could go on, but the answer is simple: Capitalism is killing our planet; it is destroying our future; it is destroying the lives of millions of people in this country and on this planet today.\n\nThese are crises that no political party in the United States can solve. They are the permanent problems of the market: misery means profit; hunger means profit; disease means profit; prisons mean profit; racism means profit.\n\nWhat does any of this have to do with the struggle against racism? Everything. Racism is the central divide between ordinary people in this country, and without a struggle against it, it will be impossible to organize any coherent movement for anything. What I'm suggesting is not organizing on a false basis of unity for unity's sake, but unity on the basis of solidarity and the understanding that an injury to one is an injury to all.\n\nIt is no mystery why socialism is no longer a dirty word in the United States. It is no mystery why thirteen million people voted for an open socialist - Bernie Sanders - in this country. Not only is this an indictment of capitalism's failures, but it is also an expressed desire for a better way. We want real democracy, where the people who create the wealth in this society are entitled to have a say in how it is distributed. We want real freedom - freedom from racism, imprisonment, borders, detention, and second-class personhood.\n\nThis is not the first time in history that socialist ideas were dominant, and where ordinary people demanded a social prioritizing of human needs and not corporate profits. This year marks the hundredth anniversary of the Russian Revolution, where for the first time in human history, the poor and the peasantry, led by the Russian working class, organized a revolution against capitalism and built a different kind of society.\n\nThe revolution was hailed by the working class around the world, which saw ordinary people like themselves take their country out of World War I and take democratic control of the direction of society. In this country, the Russian Revolution inspired socialists and radicals and eventually Communists to get serious about political organizing and building a revolutionary alternative to the viciousness of capitalism and all of the horrors that came with it.\n\nI am going to close with a long quote from American socialist Eugene Debs. This quote is from a speech he gave in Canton, Ohio in 1918 in opposition to World War I. Debs is known for this speech because, as a result of giving it, he was found guilty of sedition and imprisoned. But this was so much more than an antiwar speech. It was a speech that was also imbued with the hope and optimism that found expression in the Russian Revolution. He said:\n\nSocialism is a growing idea; an expanding philosophy. It is spreading over the entire face of the earth: It is as vain to resist it, as it would be to arrest the sunrise on the morrow. It is coming, coming, coming all along the line. Can you not see it? If not, I advise you to consult an oculist. There is certainly something the matter with your vision.\n\nIt is the mightiest movement in the history of mankind. What a privilege to serve it! I have regretted a thousand times that I can do so little for the movement that has done so much for me. The little that I am, the little that I am hoping to be, I owe to the Socialist movement. It has given me my ideas and ideals; my principles and convictions, and I would not exchange one of them for all of Rockefeller's bloodstained dollars. It has taught me how to serve - a lesson to me of priceless value. It has taught me the ecstasy in the handclasp of a comrade. It has enabled me to hold high communion with you, and made it possible for me to take my place side by side with you in the great struggle for the better day; to multiply myself over and over again, to thrill with a fresh-born personhood; to feel life truly worthwhile; to open new avenues of vision; to spread out glorious vistas; to know that I am kin to all that throbs; to be class-conscious, and to realize that, regardless of nationality, race, creed, color or sex, every man, every woman who toils, who renders useful service, every member of the working class without an exception, is my comrade, my brother and sister - and that to serve them and their cause is the highest duty of my life.\n\nKeeanga-Yamahtta Taylor is an assistant professor in Princeton University's Department of African American Studies.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIf you've read anything about Bernie Sanders and black or minority voters, you've read about how he doesn't, can't, or won't win them over. Countless articles describe the campaign as either tone deaf on race issues or, even worse, merely the left version of Donald Trump's white-male grievance campaign. A corollary is the oft-repeated \"Bernie Bros\" narrative, which casts Sanders's supporters as primarily young angry white men who are one anime avatar away from being in Gamer Gate.\n\nBut when it comes to Sanders's allegedly melanin-poor supporters, there are more shallow opinions than hard facts. While Hillary Clinton won overwhelming majorities of black voters in states like South Carolina, Clinton's margin of support among African Americans in the North has been smaller. With younger black voters, the Vermont senator has often tied or outpaced her.\n\nAnd Sanders has now made up so much ground that he's running neck-and-neck with Clinton among nonwhite registered Democrats younger than fifty.\n\nFinding these voting blocs inconvenient to its preferred framing, the media has largely ignored them. Instead of articles about the young female, black, Hispanic, Native American, Asian American, and Arab Americans who back Sanders, we get a deluge of articles about the horrifying paleness of Sanders's base.\n\nWe get absolute silence about Clinton's especially strong backing from rich white Democrats over thirty.\n\nMeanwhile, when Clinton's abysmal numbers among young voters are even discussed, they're often chalked up to youthful idealism - not to any flaw of Clinton as a candidate.\n\nLast weekend, my frustration with this media phenomenon hit a new high.\n\nFollowing Sanders's landslide wins in Alaska, Hawaii, and Washington, the media rushed to fit the resounding victories into its preconceived framework. The Washington Post typified the reaction, publishing an article entitled \"Why Did Bernie Sanders Dominate Saturday? Caucuses in Whiter States.\" Hawaii is the least white state in the country, with more than three-quarters of its residents from nonwhite and mixed race backgrounds; Washington is one of the country's ten most heterogeneous states.\n\nMany who favor Sanders predicted that his anticipated victories in Hawaii, Alaska, and Washington would do nothing to change the narrative about Bernie's POC \"problem.\" But such brazen whitewashing was too much.\n\nI, along with tens of thousands of others, decided to express my vexation using the hashtag #BernieMadeMeWhite. \"Ever since I voted for Bernie,\" my first tweet read, \"I've been binge watching Friends. #BernieMadeMeWhite .\"\n\nWithin a few hours, the hashtag was the number one trending topic, beating out even #TheWalkingDead. I wasn't surprised at its resonance. The media, armed with a facile meme and selective readings of exit polls, has relentlessly painted a picture that doesn't do justice to the diversity of the Sanders coalition. Anointing Clinton the champion of people of color has silenced our issues and concerns.\n\nOver the weekend, countless people from all backgrounds and ethnicities used the hashtag to call out the mainstream media. Additional permutations were launched: #BernieMadeMeMale by women tired of being pigeonholed as sexist dudebros, #BernieMadeMeYoung by older voters weary of being ignored. Hispanic voters, Asian voters, Arab voters, First peoples, and others also chimed in, expressing their frustration with a media that sees them all as Clinton fans.\n\nEarlier this month, the Nation 's Joan Walsh, one of the chief purveyors of this line, spoke about the whiteness of a Sanders rally in Washington - just as a camera panned over a group of Hispanic voters holding a sign that read \"V-I-V-A-B-E-R-N-I-E,\" and moments before Sanders was introduced by Sikh leader Hira Bhullar.\n\nWhile she later apologized for her error, Walsh was not impressed by #BernieMadeMeWhite. \"Hashtags, while cool, can't create facts,\" she said. When I told her that media figures like her are the reason why people are so upset, she responded: \"I'm sorry they feel erased by the demographic data provided by exit polls.\"\n\nYet Walsh's purported commitment to empiricism is rather shallow. The regional and generational divides among black voters, for instance, are arguably as noteworthy as Clinton's robust support among African Americans as a whole. At the very least, they reveal a much more complicated story than the one Walsh and others are telling. The closer you look, the harder it is to justify the \"nonwhite people vote for Clinton\" narrative.\n\nBut it's a narrative many are committed to peddling. Some objected to the #BernieMadeMeWhite hashtag as offensive and suggested the slogan showed \"how white Bernie supporters are.\" When it was pointed out that I, a black man, started the hashtag, I was accused of being a self-hating black man and a token. I received one direct message on Twitter with just the word \"COON.\"\n\nA trending hashtag won't have any long-term effect on the mainstream media. However, a clever one can catch on and bring people together in common cause. I've personally connected with hundreds of progressives who felt isolated and left out of the discussion this election.\n\nHopefully #BernieMadeMeWhite also sparked some fruitful conversations and changed at least a few minds about Sanders and social-democratic politics. Any progressive candidate worth the name needs a diverse voting base and a set of policies that attack oppression in all forms. Bernie Sanders, while flawed, can lay claim to having both. And that means more than a hashtag.\n\nLeslie Lee III is a writer from Baton Rouge who now resides in the Washington, DC area.

Only the Left can do it, because Democrats won't.\n\nJonathan Thorne / Flickr\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe Supreme Court has always been the scandal of American democracy. How do you justify the power that nine unelected judges - almost all of them, historically, white men - wield in a society that styles itself a democracy?\n\nThat scandal reached a peak in the last third of the twentieth century, when a combination of hard-right judicial theorists (Robert Bork and Antonin Scalia among them) and nervous liberals started worrying about what was called \"the counter-majoritarian difficulty\" or the \"counter-majoritarian dilemma.\"\n\nThe result of that reconsideration of the Court and judicial review was, among other things, the theory of constitutional interpretation that we call originalism.\n\nOriginalism held that the only justification for the Court reviewing and overruling the decisions of democratically elected legislators was that it was doing so on the basis of the Constitution itself. Not the living Constitution - that is, as a progressive document whose meaning changes over time - but the original Constitution.\n\nBecause the original Constitution, as a written text, represents the expressed will of the people, enacted in actual words that are binding across time. Counterintuitively, when it comes to the Court, the idea is that it is the cold, dead hand of the past, interpreted through the abstemious and self-effacing modesty of the present, that is most likely to yield the greatest democracy in the future.\n\nThat, any rate, was the theory, and it came to be adopted by many liberals as well. As the liberal Laurence Tribe, paraphrasing the liberal Ronald Dworkin (paraphrasing either Nixon or Friedman on Keynes), would say in 1998: \"We are all originalists now.\"\n\nWhat a difference two decades makes. In the now of 2018, we find ourselves in the peculiar position of having two Supreme Court justices - Gorsuch and Kavanaugh - elected by a president who lost the popular vote (that is, does not, on any credible theory of democracy, represent the will of the majority of the people) and confirmed by a group of senators who represent a minority of the people (that is, do not, on any credible theory of democracy, represent the majority of the people).\n\nThose two justices - a minority chosen by a minority and confirmed by a minority, with each minority marinating in whiteness, maleness, and wealth - will comprise 40 percent (or 2/5) of the five votes that will be striking down progressive legislation and policies of Congress and the states, legislation, and policies reflecting the will of the majority.\n\nThis is a new frontier of the counter-majoritarian dilemma.\n\nThe politically smartest-because it is the truest-answer to this latest iteration of the counter-majoritarian dilemma is to go after all three of the institutions that have come together to create this latest iteration of the scandal of democracy: the Supreme Court, the Senate, and the Electoral College.\n\nWe cannot stop merely at criticizing the Supreme Court, packing the Court, calling into question its legitimacy. It is the entire panoply of these three institutions - the Court, the Senate, and the Electoral College, which are baked into the constitutional design of this country - that we must confront.\n\nThe principle to mount against that scandal of democracy is simple: one person, one vote. In a democracy, no one's vote should count for more than any other person's vote. In the democracy of the future, where the 2/5 Rule of Gorsuch/Kavanaugh shall dominate the polity, it seems like the opposite will be the case.\n\nEvery rich white man's vote which stands behind the votes that Gorsuch and Kavanaugh will cast on the Supreme Court will carry more weight than that of everyone else. Again, it's not enough to criticize the Court only; we have to take on the Court, the Senate, and the Electoral College.\n\nMounting this kind of political program against the scandal of democracy - which involves confronting a good deal of the Constitution, not all of it, but a good deal of it - would be radical. I don't expect the Democrats to do it. It seems like a great task for the socialist left to take up. And very much in keeping with the historical reality of the socialist movement, particularly in Europe.\n\nDemocratic reform in Europe was won by the socialist movements. Democratizing ancient, sclerotic institutions of the state has always been the project of the socialist left.\n\nCorey Robin is the author of The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Donald Trump and a contributing editor at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nBarbara Madeloni is an educator and activist from Northampton, Mass., who was elected in May as president of the 110,000 member Massachusetts Teachers Association for a two year term. Madeloni defeated Tim Sullivan, the chosen candidate of the previous, term-limited president Paul Toner, who was known for his closeness to Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and the state's Democratic Party establishment.\n\nShe first became known in 2012 as a professor at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst's School of Education, where she led opposition to a proposed teacher evaluation system overseen by Pearson, the large for-profit education company. She was fired because of her activism around the issue.\n\nMadeloni is unique among labor leaders. Her level of analysis concerning the crisis facing organized labor and public education is refreshing at a time when both national teachers unions - the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers - seem unshakably wedded to a failed model of unionism.\n\nThe NEA was one of the unions to endorse Obama for reelection despite his many betrayals of teachers unions. Under the tenure of President Randi Weingarten, the American Federation of Teachers has received millions of dollars from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation - perhaps the greatest institutional threat to public education in the US today.\n\nIn contrast, Madeloni is committed to a fierce campaign against neoliberal education reform and is unafraid of mentioning the word \"capital\" or pointing out the deeply destructive role of the Democratic Party in the crisis of public education. Those on the Left interested in the revitalization of the labor movement would do well to study Madeloni's spirited defense of public education.\n\nMadeloni was interviewed by Matthew Cunningham-Cook .\n\nYour election was considered a major upset. It's incredibly rare for the establishment candidate to be defeated in the National Education Association (the parent union of the Massachusetts Teachers Association). What explains your victory?\n\nThe word people use to describe my election is \"seismic.\" The election was supposed to be an ascendancy - a significant part of how I was able to win was that my opponent Tim Sullivan's campaign thought victory was in the books. Sullivan never said anything to differentiate himself from the current president, for whom the membership was profoundly disappointed, at best.\n\nThe loss itself says that the union establishment was out of touch with its members - teachers, who are in an enormous amount of pain. The joy in human relationships and the possibilities of teaching have been foreclosed by the \"education deform\" project.\n\nWe were told by union leaders that our only choice was compromise. I offered a broader analysis that named what was happening and the hope of real solidarity and action. I said that we can actually do something about the assault on public education. I said that this was a bipartisan, corporate attack, and I provided a vision for public education that is joyful, creative, imaginative, and democratic.\n\nThis helped move people from pain to analysis to \"now I can know myself in a different way.\" In the context of the neoliberal regime, we are deeply alienated. I emphasized that educators don't have to be alone; we can act with others. With others, we can have agency and act, and make the world what we want it to be. The joy we experienced at the union's annual meeting was people finding themselves again.\n\nTalk about the context in the lead-up to the election. Why was the leadership so alienated from the membership?\n\nIt was an overwhelming year. The new teacher evaluation system hit, and teachers were finding it to be onerous and something that can be used to discipline teachers that administrators don't like.\n\nThe evaluation system has this pretense of objectivity, which makes it a better tool for management that wants to get rid of a teacher. Teachers were feeling oppressed by it - instead of being trusted, teachers were expected to prove themselves constantly.\n\nThere was more testing for more students. There was the demand to respond to the Common Core standards. Then there was a civil suit filed saying that English language learner students were not having their academic needs met. The suit was won, and as a remedy the courts decided that every teacher needs to take a course about teaching ELL students. Teachers had to take a thirteen week course that many described as not helpful at all, neither for the teachers nor for the kids.\n\nThen there was a requirement that teachers have to be fingerprinted, and they have to pay for their fingerprinting. Then there was the legislative threat to our retiree health care benefits. There was a cascade. People were overwhelmed by the amount of the work that they had to do and the constant demand to respond to mandates.\n\nYou've been quoted as saying that \"rich white men [are] deciding the course of public education for black and brown children.\" People have criticized you for this.\n\nWe have these phrases - \"achievement gap,\" referencing racial differences in test scores, or \"education is the civil rights issue of our time.\" Both are referencing race. You're allowed to imply race if you're a corporate reformer and the reforms are targeted in poor black and brown communities. But educators are not allowed to say the word \"white,\" and we're not allowed to identify the racism and greed that's at the core of corporate education \"reform.\"\n\nThese are just facts. Eli Broad, Bill Gates, Arne Duncan, Joel Klein - we have rich white men who are making decisions about black and brown children. The interesting thing about this is that we're not allowed to say it. Discussing the juxtaposition between \"rich white men\" and \"black and brown children\" is important because it enables us to understand and explore the intersection of race and capital and how it relates to the corporate education reform project.\n\nWhat about the threat to retiree health benefits? Your predecessor endorsed the plan, which created a multiple-tier system for benefits. Endorsing a plan to cut benefits seems unorthodox for a union leader.\n\nWith the retiree health benefits, teachers will have to work in the system longer to have their full health benefits covered. For someone like me who entered the field later in life, I would have to work until I was something like eighty years old to get full coverage of health care benefits. We shouldn't be dividing the pie and saying that some people are going to get good benefits and others aren't.\n\nWhen I went to the committee hearing on the retiree health benefits, the statehouse was packed with people from unions across the state. Throughout the day, people got up to oppose the bill, and it became clear that the committee would not be able to proceed with it.\n\nAt that hearing, the current president of the MTA, Paul Toner, testified that in spite of what had been said, that the committee must move forward with the bill. His message to the membership was, once again, \"If we don't agree to this bad thing, a worse thing will happen.\"\n\nThat positions members in a narrative about themselves that says that we are powerless, subject to forces that we can't control. It's painful for me to think that this is a narrative that people accept. It makes me sad to hear people talk about themselves that way. It's such a small vision of life.\n\nWhat our campaign offered was a broader, powerful vision of ourselves in community. We didn't offer a simple militancy, but a deeper power to create our world, which is something that we as educators should feel when we head out into the day.\n\nWhat is on your agenda as president? What do you plan to do?\n\nThere was a new business item that passed at the annual MTA meeting which calls for the union to tell the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education that we want a three-year moratorium on the new Common Core-aligned PARCC testing. The same new business item goes on to say that the MTA will support member-led forums where we discuss the impact of testing and of the teacher evaluation system on students, teachers, and schools.\n\nWe need to step back and name what's happening. We're also going to ask, \"What do we want our schools to look like?\" So we're creating and claiming a vision for public education that will be broader than the corporate deformers'. Parents who send their children to public schools understand that what happens in schools is more complex than tests or college readiness. The union needs to come together with parents and the community and ask, \"What do we want to do about this? What do we want your schools to look like?\"\n\nThese forums and the conversations they generate will structure the work of our first six months. From there we will, as a rank and file-driven union, choose next steps.\n\nBarbara Madeloni is President of the Massachusetts Teachers Association.\n\nMatthew Cunningham-Cook has written for Labor Notes , the Public Employee Press , Al Jazeera America, and the Nation .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nThe far right is dangerously obsessed with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and her fellow left-wing members of Congress. They deserve the Left's solidarity.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) speaks as Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), and Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) listen during a news conference at the US Capitol on July 15, 2019 in Washington, DC.  (Alex Wroblewski / Getty)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIt's never reassuring to begin the New Year with a right-wing insurrection against an elected government. Much was disturbing about the January 6 Capitol riot, including the possibility of more antidemocratic, white supremacist mayhem yet to come. But especially terrifying were the threats on Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's life, and the news that the democratic socialist congresswoman may have come close to assassination.\n\nDescribing the events of January 6, AOC said on Instagram, \"I can tell you that I had a very close encounter where I thought I was going to die.\" She said that she couldn't say much more about it for security reasons, but elaborated, \"I did not know whether I was going to make it to the end of that day alive. Not just in a general sense, but in a very, very specific sense.\"\n\nThe far right has been obsessed with AOC since her election in 2018. Its scary fixation on her reflects its terror of women and people of color holding power, of course, but these hard-rightists are also - as fascists always have been - deeply triggered by socialism.\n\nA man from Texas was arrested after participating in the riots and calling for AOC's assassination online. He now faces five federal charges. It's good that the government is taking action against these dangerous criminals. But the more powerful actors freely walking into the Capitol every day may be even more dangerous. AOC said on Instagram that she did not feel safe in the place other members of Congress were hiding during the January 6 riot, because some of them were white supremacists and QAnon sympathizers, she said, \"who I have felt would disclose my location and would create opportunities for me to be hurt, kidnapped, etc.\" AOC rightly skipped Biden's inauguration, both to join the picket line of striking workers in the Bronx , and also, she said, to avoid the security risk of being near those colleagues.\n\nThe rest of the Squad appear to be in danger, too. Cori Bush has just moved her office, \"for my team's safety,\" she said, after harassment from Marjorie Taylor Greene, an openly anti-Semitic white nationalist congresswoman who has called for the assassination of Nancy Pelosi and other colleagues, referred to January 6 as a \"1776 moment,\" and has called Cori Bush a \"Black Lives Matter terrorist.\" On January 6, Ilhan Omar was evacuated to a secure location otherwise reserved for senior congressional leadership - because, she has said, law enforcement believed her life was at special risk. Since her election to Congress, Trump has incited threats against Omar, and in the months leading up to the November election, those threats increased. During the riot, Ayanna Pressley's staff found that the panic buttons in their offices had been torn out. Rashida Tlaib has received constant death threats throughout her time in office.\n\nThere is a psychosexual edge to the Right's obsession with AOC. Eroticizing what they hate, rightists circulate memes on the internet depicting AOC as a tyrannical dominatrix, in full BDSM leather gear, crushing white men under her sharp boots. In one of them, Jeff Bezos kneels at her feet, handing over money, in a financial domination scenario (\"findom\" is an extremely niche kink in which submissives, usually men, enjoy giving up money, usually to women). The idea of socialism as totalitarianism - specifically, a dictatorship in which rich white men are forcibly expropriated by powerful women of color - looms large in the right-wing imaginary. (Literally \"large\" - in many of these memes, AOC, physically a small, slight woman, is a giant, looming alarmingly over the white men she tyrannizes.) AOC is at the center of this fantasy. It would be harmless as a bit of edgy pornography, but in this political climate, the fantasy can easily turn deadly.\n\nWhile racism and patriarchy are fundamental to fascist thinking, the fascist obsession with socialism is just as central. Every far-right movement in history has viewed socialism as its key adversary, and this one is no exception. For Hitler and the Nazis, racial enemies were inseparable from socialism, and contemporary far-rightists think the same way. Today, the right-wing hatred of socialism, personified by a woman of color, is a global phenomenon. In 2018, the same year that AOC was elected to Congress, right-wing Jair Bolsonaro was elected President of Brazil, and Marielle Franco, a black socialist city council member in Rio, and an outspoken activist against police brutality, was assassinated. A year later, two former police officers connected to a paramilitary group were arrested and charged with her murder. Both suspects had ties to Bolsonaro.\n\nAssuming a childishly anarchistic posture toward government, some on the left have imagined that the January 6 rioters' complaints about Democrats mirror their own. Jimmy Dore, for example, doubted that the riots would have happened if Americans had their two-thousand-dollar checks. This is a perilous misreading. In addition to the explicit dangers to the Squad, there were numerous threats on Nancy Pelosi's life that day, including calls to hang her or put a bullet through her head. That's not because Pelosi has failed to write relief checks or support Medicare for All - exactly the opposite. It's because the Right sees Pelosi as socialist.\n\nThat idea isn't limited to fringe weirdos - even Lindsey Graham tweeted in November that Pelosi and the Democratic mainstream support socialism \"deep in their soul.\" At last summer's GOP convention, the main message from speaker after speaker was that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were socialists. On the loonier right, this opinion is expressed only slightly more floridly: Representative Mo Brooks referred to the January 6 rioters as patriots \"fighting back against anti-Christian socialists.\" The Right has often seen socialist phantasms lurking in the mainstream; historian Richard Hofstadter quoted a right-wing woman in the 1950s sighing, upon the reelection of Dwight Eisenhower, \"Four more years of socialism.\"\n\nThere is zero affinity between right-wing and left-wing grievances. If you're a socialist, far-rightists share none of your political goals and viciously oppose every ideal you take seriously. They also want you dead. That's as good a definition of a political enemy as I can imagine.\n\nOf course, individuals caught up in right-wing movements can and do change their minds. Your QAnon-obsessed neighbor probably isn't violent and you should try to convince her of the error of her ways - and even why she should be a socialist instead (The New York Times recently reported on a Bernie supporter who, disillusioned with Democrats after the Vermont socialist's 2016 loss, had turned to QAnon. We can certainly reach people like that). But as an organized movement, there's nothing harmless or politically laudable about the forces behind the January 6 mob. This movement doesn't just hate socialism; its hatred of socialism is at the core of its politics. The more it grows and mobilizes, the more violently it will fight any socialists who get close to power.\n\nSome have suggested that AOC was being overly dramatic in candidly describing the risks she faced that day and continues to face. That's dangerously wrong. The Squad has rightly opposed expanding the federal government's legal tools for combatting domestic terrorism. The government's existing mechanisms are entirely adequate, and to add more would likely lead to restrictions on the civil liberties of the Left and of racial minorities. But the Left needs to take the threats directed at our elected democratic socialist leaders seriously. We must demand adequate security for AOC and the rest of the Squad and a full investigation and prosecution of anyone who endangers their lives. We must also defeat this depraved movement through organizing, persuasion, social pressure, and, when needed, force, including law enforcement.\n\nMeanwhile, AOC and her fellow Squad members are putting their lives on the line every day fighting for democratic socialism and progressive values. They deserve all our solidarity.\n\nLiza Featherstone is a columnist for Jacobin , a freelance journalist, and the author of Selling Women Short: The Landmark Battle for Workers' Rights at Wal-Mart .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn the burgeoning genre of think pieces linking the rises of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, Stephen Marche's vapid Guardian essay over the weekend is perhaps the definitive contribution.\n\nOver the past several months, the two have been variously equated on the basis of their policy positions , hostility to party establishments, and allegiance to political \"extremism\" - in other words, as somehow equivalent political phenomena.\n\nBoth Trump and Sanders, we are ceaselessly told, are essentially vehicles for outrage, addressing discontent through demagogy, and are therefore similar. As David Brooks wrote last September:\n\nThese sudden stars [Sanders, Trump, Ben Carson, and Jeremy Corbyn] are not really about governing. They are tools for their supporters' self-expression. They allow supporters to make a statement, demand respect or express anger or resentment. Sarah Palin was a pioneer in seeing politics not as a path to governance but as an expression of her followers' id.\n\nAll \"populists\" are created equal, you see.\n\nBut in channeling this canard, Marche's essay - a lengthy account of a road trip to Iowa where Trump and Sanders held rallies within days of each other as well as the author's reflections on his own whiteness - cannot be surpassed.\n\nThe piece opens with a cringeworthy bit of smug Anglo-Canadian nationalist liturgy in which Marche - who, like this writer, hails from Canada's largest city - waxes poetic about the country's \"inert virtue of tolerance\" that, he tells us, is \"the most prominent inheritance of the British Empire.\" (It is unclear where Canada's lengthy history of racism - including the state's attempted cultural genocide of the country's indigenous population - fits into Marche's historical narrative.)\n\nAs our hero draws closer to the Yankee border, his tender Canadian sensibilities begin to be challenged by the \"carbon monoxide-infused queue waiting to enter Detroit\" - a place where his motherland's supposedly limitless tolerance and pristine air are suddenly nowhere to be found.\n\nThe essay's bizarre mise-en-scène is erected around Marche's periodic, if largely incoherent, reflections about his own whiteness. It is unclear for what purpose, besides clickbaity adornment, passages like the following actually serve:\n\nAt the corner of my groin, where it had been tingling, a brown patch spilled like spoiled milk down my skin. A wide brown patch shaped like post-climate change Florida in the corner of my thigh. Instantly, I knew I would die. And the next moment I started driving back to Toronto, to my wife and children, flesh of my flesh.\n\nBesides these peculiar interjections, most of the piece consists of shallow reportage about the two rallies Marche attends:\n\nThe woman beside me - Stars 'n' Stripes Hat - was wearing a pewter elephant pendant. A young girl in a bright orange dress passed out of the VIP entrance wearing an elephant pendant encrusted with diamonds. Elephant pendants were a theme, I noticed, and elephant brooches and elephant rings and elephant T-shirts. They came in all different price points and in all different styles: round elephants reminiscent of French cartoons from the 1960s, and strange pseudo-sexual shimmies, and with 1920s straw boater hats leading parades.\n\nWhy any of these things are at all relevant we mere mortals can only ponder. Marche devotes several paragraphs to extended reflections on Trump's hair, and even one to Sanders's, his growing surplus of adjectives and cultural allusions piling up in neat little mounds as the essay wears on.\n\nEventually, a familiar thesis emerges as Marche writes:\n\nThe Bernie Sanders rally in Davenport was the precise opposite of the Donald Trump rally in Burlington and yet precisely the same in every detail . . . The same specter of angry white people haunts Sanders's rally, the same sense of longing for a country that was, the country that has been taken away.\n\nTo substantiate this claim, the author notes that attendees at both rallies are wearing various bits of campaign swag, own smartphones, and shout slogans. Their radically different political demands apparently do not warrant a mention.\n\nRegurgitating a familiar bit of anti-socialist agitprop, Marche brands Sanders' supporters \"cornfed hipsters,\" observing that \"[while] rich white people can afford to think about socialism, the poor can only afford their anger.\" (That socialism has, at various points, had a considerable pull on portions of the American working class is something Marche conveniently omits.)\n\nDismissing Sanders's calls for a \"political revolution\" in a few sentences, Marche casually concludes that the Vermont senator's crusade to topple the proverbial casino of American capitalism is doomed to fail because he has personally observed several actual casinos while driving through Iowa. The piece then closes with a few paragraphs of forgettable pabulum and intellectual window-dressing.\n\nWhat's striking about Marche's essay is how little genuine political content it contains. Relying largely on irrelevant anecdotes about the appearance of the two rallies, he almost entirely ignores the political programs they were organized to promote.\n\nIndeed, he declines to substantiate the whole enterprise of comparing Sanders and Trump in the first place - that they are both white political candidates who draw crowds and are clearly the products of various kinds of discontent is evidently enough.\n\nLabour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn , Sanders's further-left analog in Britain, has received similar treatment.\n\nIn an especially hyperbolic article in the Daily Beast entitled \"The Daily Hate: Corbyn, Trump and the New Politics of Spite,\" Maajid Nawaz declared after Corbyn's victory: \"We are living in a spiteful, populist time . . . Across the Western Hemisphere a new type of leader is emerging whose rise to power has been as unpredictable as it has been swift.\"\n\nThis new politics of \"extremism,\" Nawaz wrote, includes everything and everyone from Corbyn to Trump to Greek neo-Nazis to Islamic and other religious fundamentalists - all of whom are ostensibly channeling \"parochial bigotry\" and seeking \"cultural dominance.\"\n\nOnce again, the political aspirations of these various groups - to say nothing of the fact that some are competing within democratic structures while others are seeking to bring them down - do not factor into the analysis.\n\nDoes it matter that Sanders and Corbyn are lifelong leftists who've won multiple popular mandates from various constituencies while Trump is an openly bigoted , cartoon plutocrat who's never been elected by anyone? To the various liberal and centrist pundits penning such comparisons, it evidently does not.\n\nFrom their perspective, figures like Corbyn, Sanders, and Trump are all \"populists\" - i.e., unserious, immoderate, and anti-establishment. That they are attacking completely different establishments and have completely different political programs is simply ignored.\n\nIn this increasingly popular ontology of Sanders and Trump, the normative content of their respective populisms is given little if any weight; opposed to the neoliberal consensus, albeit in radically different ways, both are dismissed as comparable popular outbursts that need to be extinguished by \"serious people.\"\n\nThis brings us to the actual function of these comparisons, which is to neutralize the Sanders insurgency and others like it. In affixing the same label to both the far right and the Left, liberals and centrists are able, in a single maneuver, to inoculate themselves against challenges from the latter.\n\nSuch reflexive defensiveness among elite stenographers can only be the product of a political consensus which, perhaps for the first time in a generation, feels genuinely threatened. And not just by Donald Trump.\n\nLuke Savage is a staff writer at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Dear Rich White Friends: The Pandemic Isn't a Vacation. Black and Brown People Are Still Dying.\n\nEric Nopanen/Unsplash\n\nMy house has a strict quarantine policy. I share indoor space with my five roommates and a few others in our pod, and only see most friends outdoors, 6 feet away and/or wearing masks. Yet whenever someone we know is passing through town, we end up voting to let them spend the night or even a week, sharing our kitchen, bathroom, and germs. This feels safe because our friends are also quarantining. Like us, they work remotely, can easily get tested, and have little issue receiving public health guidance.\n\nIf I weren't working in media and wearing a mask in public ( and feeling occasionally deprived of my favorite social pastimes-concerts and festivals), I could probably forget there's a global pandemic going on. I never lost my job, many of my peers have resumed flying, and nobody I know has gotten sick since April. Instead, we're taking advantage of remote-work policies to bounce between AirBNBs in sunny locales, with more time to self-reflect and connect with family. I'm so confident in my negative COVID status that I even stayed over at my grandparents' house last month. The whole thing's started to feel like a surreal collective vacation.\n\nSome are even more removed, able to afford Zoom tutors and in-home teachers so their kids' schooling doesn't miss a beat. $500 rapid tests- \"the new velvet rope\" -allow the 1 percent to gather risk-free, merging their pods into a caste-based bubble where the virus doesn't exist. \"Have they been quarantining?\" we ask when deciding if someone's safe for our roommate to kiss. The subtext is, \"can they afford to?\"; if not, they can't come to our party.\n\nCOVID-19 kills: as of this week, 200,000 people in our country alone. Barring a miracle vaccine before winter, the worst may be still yet to come. In California, where I live, August was the deadliest month of the entire pandemic, with 3,745 lives lost , an 18 percent increase over July. The brunt of this mass death is being borne by Black, Latino, and Indigenous people, particularly those in income brackets lower than my own, where economic necessity forces many to keep packing meat , delivering groceries, dropping off takeout, and cleaning hotels for the rest of us. Our bubble rests on their backs, is kept inflated by the same lungs that coronavirus attacks. None of this is news, but six months into the pandemic, the numbers keep getting worse.\n\nThanks to institutional racism in American science and medicine, we've only slowly glimpsed a full picture of COVID-19's disparities. By May, it was clear that the states who rushed to re-open saw the most unequal share of Black death. In July, we knew that seven Indigenous tribes had case rates higher than that of any US state. And by September, what had three months prior been a 35 point gap in white and Black mortality rates swelled to 51, according to Andi Egbert of the APM Research Lab. The gap between white and Indigenous grew from 10 to 35, while the over-representation of Latino and Pacific Islander deaths continued to expand as well. When you adjust by age, the disparities get even worse. Today, white people are dying from COVID-19 at lower rates than Black people die without it.\n\nYes, the pandemic is merely exacerbating disparities that already existed. As disease historian Frank M. Snowden told the N ew Yorker , diseases spread \"along the fault lines created by poverty and inequality.\" Black people already had asthma and lung disease; Latinos worked jobs that didn't offer healthcare; Indigenous communities lacked information access and mistrusted Western institutions. Sometimes I hear myself and other white folks regurgitate these lines with an air of resignation, as if the situation is inevitable, absolving us of guilt. If this is just the way things are, then it's tragic, but there's not much we can do. In fact, our inaction is ushering in a new era of deadly American racism: some of us stay afloat or even rise, while others sink and maybe drown. COVID begets more racialized poverty begets more COVID, ad nauseum.\n\nBefore the pandemic started, American billionaires collectively held about $3 trillion. In the last six months, as most people dreaded an economic depression, the billionaires grew their hoard by nearly a third, $845 billion and counting . It's never been more blatant or painful to see: profits are the unpaid wages of the working class.\n\nMy upper-class white peers and I were already insulated from the suffering of Black, Brown, and working-class communities, but under COVID, the distance has increased. We've fled cities to seek the open space and fresh air of the countryside and suburbs, while also closing ourselves off to friends, lovers, and relatives who don't meet our safety standards. Both geographically and socially removed, we're less likely to feel the pressing need to take action. We see the numbers but they don't affect us; we no longer have to hear the sirens. Besides a grandparent here and there, the dead are not people we know.\n\nThe same is likely true for our national leaders, whose procrastination in passing a second aid package has left Americans to bail each other out. But even that urgency has faded: In the early days of the pandemic, my friends launched a mutual aid effort inviting still-employed workers to make direct cash payments to people who'd lost their jobs. $100,000 was moved in a matter of days. Then payments slowed to a crawl, with just $73,000 donated over the next five months. This summer, I helped them make a last-ditch appeal to people who've been working remotely, asking them to consider sending what they used to spend on their commute as a weekly donation to a Black or Brown person in need.\n\nPerhaps, as the threat of infection has begun to feel farther away, mutual aid has fallen out of vogue.

      "text": "The Supreme Court Is Set to Kill Affirmative Action. Just Not for Rich White Kids.\n\nJon Han\n\nEvan Mandery January+February 2023 Issue\n\nWhen he was 8 years old, Michael Wang decided he wanted to go to Harvard. \"I don't know if it's the Asian stereotype,\" he told me, \"but I saw it as an avenue to social mobility.\" Though he wouldn't have thought of it in these terms when he was 8, Michael meant the sort of upper-echelon mobility familiar to graduates of elite colleges. Specifically, he wanted to be a neurosurgeon. Because he was that sort of kid, he read several peer-reviewed articles about cloning and checked the authors' credentials. When he saw that many of the researchers had gone to Harvard, he knew that was the college for him.\n\nFrom that point forward, Michael's parents made it their life's work to help their only child achieve his goal. Michael's dad-who goes by Jeff-had a sense of what it would take. He'd come to the United States from Shanghai in the 1980s as part of the wave of Chinese students who had emigrated to the West when Deng Xiaoping implemented the Four Modernizations following Mao Zedong's death. Jeff got a PhD in physics from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, worked in banking for a while, and then transitioned to tutoring students in math and science. Today he runs a Mathnasium franchise in Union City, California, where Michael grew up. Many of his students went on to top colleges, and Jeff watched and emulated the parents' tactics. Sociologist Annette Lareau would call it \"concerted cultivation.\" Yale Law professor Amy Chua might say that he became a Tiger Dad.\n\nThis is an adapted excerpt from Poison Ivy: How Elite Colleges Divide Us , published October 25, 2022, by The New Press. Copyright © 2022 by Evan Mandery.\n\nPhoto by Ilona Lieberman\n\nIn fifth grade, Jeff persuaded the school district to let Michael take algebra. Each day, he picked his son up at his elementary school and drove him to the middle school for his advanced math class. In seventh grade, he collected Michael at the middle school and drove him to a local high school to take Algebra II. By his sophomore year, Michael had finished BC Calculus. He ended up taking 15 AP courses. Michael's 4.64 GPA made him salutatorian of his class. He got a perfect score on the ACT and nearly aced the SAT, too, with scores that put him squarely in the 99th percentile. He also played piano, debated at a high level, and founded a math club. In the fall of 2012, Michael sent off his college applications-about 25 in all-with optimism and the satisfaction of knowing he'd done everything within his power to increase his chances of getting into a top college.\n\nTo say he was disappointed by the replies would be a vast understatement. By any ordinary standard, Michael did quite well, and he's soberer about the experience in retrospect, but at the time he felt devastated. Yale said no. Princeton said no. Stanford said no. Harvard put him on the waitlist. Then it said no. Columbia did the same thing. He wasn't consoled by Berkeley's offer of a free ride or by Penn and Georgetown's offers of half scholarships. \"I was definitely disappointed receiving that many rejections,\" Michael told me when I spoke with him for my new book, Poison Ivy: How Elite Colleges Divide Us , from which this essay is adapted. \"I thought to myself, 'What more can I do at this point?' \" He decided to go to Williams, which offered to cover 90 percent of his tuition.\n\nIf Michael Wang's story ended here, it'd be typical of high achievers in the modern era, in which acceptance rates at the Ivies and other elite schools hover around 5 percent. At this point, though, Michael did something decidedly atypical: He wrote the colleges asking why he'd been rejected and suggested that he'd been the victim of discrimination. Ten years later, he still has their replies. Yale's dean of undergraduate admissions wrote that the college believed that its policies \"do not disadvantage Asian American students relative to majority white students in a holistic admissions review, and also that we are in compliance with all relevant legal requirements.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, Yale's letter didn't make Michael feel much better. He obsessed about the matter. During summer vacation, he read US Supreme Court decisions on affirmative action and The Chosen , Berkeley sociologist Jerome Karabel's definitive history of college admissions at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. Karabel recounted how Jews had accounted for more than 20 percent of Harvard freshmen in the 1920s until Harvard's president, A. Lawrence Lowell, warned that the \"Jewish invasion\" would \"ruin the college\" and proposed to cap their numbers at 15 percent. An expository writing teacher at Harvard argued in a New York Times op-ed that Asians had become the new Jews. More than half of Harvard applicants with exceptionally high SAT scores were Asian American, he wrote, yet they made up less than 20 percent of admitted students. And while Asians were the fastest-growing racial group in the United States, their numbers at Harvard hadn't increased in decades.\n\nIn June 2013, Michael filed a complaint with the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. \"As recipients of federal funding,\" he wrote, \"these private universities cannot discriminate on the basis of race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, etc. Yet, they all resort to race-conscious admissions practices that violate existing federal laws and infringe upon my rights guaranteed by the Constitution.\" The universities, he said, were guilty of race-norming-meaning they were evaluating test scores and other metrics differently depending on the race or ethnicity of the applicant. Though Michael asked for his admissions decisions to be reconsidered without reference to race, he understood there was almost no chance of this happening. \"My concern was helping out high school friends who were juniors,\" he says. \"These policies affect a lot of people.\"\n\nInvestigators from three different offices of the Department of Education reached out to Michael. A lawyer in the department's Boston office told him that they'd been investigating Harvard since the 1990s, but as Michael puts it, they didn't have a smoking gun. He did what he could to advance the cause. In July 2014, he wrote an op-ed in the Mercury News against SCA-5, a bill that would have reinstated affirmative action in California, where it had been illegal since 1996. SCA-5 went down.\n\nBy this time, Michael had caught the eye of Ed Blum. Blum is the only person I've ever heard of whose Wikipedia title is \"litigant.\" He was the architect of Shelby County v. Holder , the 2013 Supreme Court decision that eviscerated the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and Fisher v. University of Texas , a 2016 decision that, but for Antonin Scalia's untimely death, would have gutted affirmative action. Blum called Michael at Williams, said that he was gathering potential plaintiffs for a lawsuit against Harvard, and asked whether Michael would be willing to serve as their spokesperson.\n\nMichael said yes.\n\nStudents for Fair Admissions v. Harvard is the most significant challenge to affirmative action in a generation. The court heard oral arguments in the Harvard case and a related University of North Carolina case on October 31. Based on skeptical questioning by the conservative justices about the meaning and value of campus diversity, among other matters, it is widely expected that they will rule to end affirmative action as we've known it for the past half-century. \"Harvard does not discriminate,\" Lawrence S. Bacow, the school's president, insisted in a statement after the Supreme Court first announced it would take the case. \"[O]ur practices are consistent with Supreme Court precedent; there is no persuasive, credible evidence warranting a different outcome.\"\n\nBut though it may seem paradoxical, it's important to understand that this construction is in large part Harvard's own doing, the consequence of its stubborn insistence-which all elite schools share-on preserving the status quo in US college admissions, almost every aspect of which is slanted in favor of kids from wealthy, overwhelmingly white, families. If nothing else, SFFA v. Harvard demonstrated this conclusively through discovery-the pretrial production of documents and deposition testimony-which opened the first significant window into Harvard's previously opaque admissions process.\n\nThroughout that process, officers are allowed to give \"tips\"-extra points-to applicants for \"distinguishing excellences.\" These include capacity for leadership, creative ability, and geography. They also include economics, race, and ethnicity. This speaks directly to a 1978 Supreme Court decision, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke , which held that racial quotas are unconstitutional, but that race could be considered as a \"plus\" factor. If the high court now eliminates racial preferences, any college inclined to do so could still diversify along socioeconomic or geographic lines. But as we will see, those paths require upsetting the status quo to surrender some of the advantage afforded to wealthy applicants. And it's hard to be too optimistic about the prospect of elite schools doing so after seeing how Harvard makes its high-end sausage.\n\nHarvard divides applications into geographic dockets based on high school location. Each is initially reviewed by an admissions officer assigned to that docket, who rates the applicant based on academics; extracurriculars; athletics; personal qualities such as integrity, helpfulness, courage, kindness, empathy, self-confidence, maturity, and grit-and school support, which basically means the strength of the applicant's recommendations. This \"first reader\" also gives a summary rating. The vast majority of students also sign up for an interview with one of 15,000 alumni interviewers, who separately scores the applicant on the same categories. The scores range from one to six, with one being the highest. Very few applicants score worse than a four. It's the admissions version of grade inflation.\n\nLike most elite colleges, Harvard also gives explicit preferences to applicants known in the world of higher education as ALDCs, a group that includes recruited athletes as well as the children of faculty, donors, and alumni-the alumni kids are called \"legacies.\" ALDCs, approximately half of them legacies, represent about 30 percent of every Harvard class, and about 43 percent of the college's white students. Being a member of this rarefied group improves one's chances of getting in by an order of magnitude. The admit rate for typical applicants to Harvard's Classes of 2014-19 averaged 5.5 percent, according to data produced in SFFA v. Harvard , but the college accepted nearly 34 percent of legacy applicants, 47 percent of faculty kids, and 86 percent of recruited athletes.\n\nBack in 2004, a team of Princeton researchers determined -based on data from three elite schools that offer admissions preferences to athletes, legacies, and underrepresented minority applicants-that being a legacy effectively gave applicants a boost equivalent to scoring 160 additional points out of 1600 on the SAT, even though legacies tend to do slightly worse in college than nonlegacies. (By comparison, Black applicants received the equivalent of a 230-point boost, Hispanic applicants 180 points, and athletes 200 points. Asian applicants suffered the equivalent of a 50-point loss.)\n\nSFFA's legal claim is simple: The plaintiffs say Harvard's subjective admissions factors are stacked against them. Because so much of the class is set aside for ALDCs, and Asian Americans aren't regarded as a disadvantaged minority, the competition they face is brutal. The plaintiffs presented most of their statistical case through Peter Arcidiacono, an econometrician based at Duke. Arcidiacono testified that if Harvard relied solely on academics, Asian Americans would constitute more than half of its admitted students, as opposed to the current 20 percent. Race might be a plus factor for others, but for Asians it's a big minus.\n\nArcidiacono is an expert witness for the plaintiffs, so if you're skeptical of his framing, consider this evidence from New York City. By state law, the sole criterion for admission to the city's eight specialized high schools is (for now) performance on the Specialized High School Admissions Test, or SHSAT. These eight schools include Brooklyn Tech, where my dad was principal; Bronx High School of Science, where my wife went; and Stuyvesant, which has the highest cutoff. In 2020, Asians filled 524 of the 766 available slots at Stuyvesant-68 percent. It's fair to question, as many have, whether the SHSAT, like the SAT, is simply another instrument correlated with wealth, or whether any single factor should decide someone's fate, but it's powerful evidence that Arcidiacono's claim has merit.\n\nWhat held Asian American applicants back, Arcidiacono found, were their personal ratings. Admissions officers gave ones or twos (on the aforementioned six-point scale) to a smaller share of those applicants than they did to students from any other racial or ethnic group. An investigation of Harvard by the Department of Justice during the 1990s found a similar pattern. Asian applicants were presumed to be oriented solely toward math and science. They were routinely described as bland, flat, or unexciting -to quote one reviewer: \"He's quiet and, of course, wants to be a doctor.\" Of all the factors Arcidiacono identified , nothing was quite so damning as to be labeled \"standard strong.\" In a sample of 10 percent of the applicants to Harvard's class of 2018, 256 students were labeled this way, and 114 of them were Asian American.\n\nNone got in.\n\nSeven months after SFFA filed its lawsuit, a company named Ivy Coach mocked Michael Wang on its blog. Ivy Coach is one of the many private consulting firms that guide parents through the process of getting their kids into elite colleges and boarding schools. After CNBC reported that Ivy Coach charged more than $100,000 for its services, the company boasted on its blog that the news station had \"grossly underreported\" its fees. When the New York Post reported that the company charged one mom $1.5 million, Ivy Coach didn't deny it, but rather wrote that the company makes \"absolutely no apologies\" for what it charges. For the 2020-21 school year, more than 43 percent of incoming Harvard freshmen from families making more than $250,000 a year reported using private admissions counselors like Ivy Coach.\n\nIvy Coach claimed that Michael had made a fundamental error in how he marketed himself. In emphasizing his piano ability and debating skills, he'd presented himself as well-rounded \"when that is the precise opposite of what schools like Yale, Princeton, and Stanford seek.\" If only Michael had been reading the company's blog, he'd have known to make himself \"extraordinary at one thing\" as opposed to \"ordinary at lots of things.\"As Ivy Coach explained in another post, \"Ordinary's boring. Extraordinary's anything but boring. Highly selective colleges don't want boring. They want extraordinary. Understood? We hope so.\"\n\nIn Michael's defense, Harvard's own data contradicts this advice. To make its statistical case, Harvard called on David Card, a Berkeley economics professor. Card argued that strength across multiple dimensions mattered enormously. He found that only 12 percent of admitted students were \"one-dimensional stars,\" meaning that they got a rating of one in a sole area, but scored two or better in fewer than three categories. By contrast, 46 percent of admitted students were \"multi-dimensionally excellent,\" meaning they got a score of at least two in three or more categories. Another 31 percent were \"multi-dimensionally solid.\"\n\nIn the context of the lawsuit, Card's argument was that Asian applicants tended to be one-dimensional academic stars whereas white applicants tended to have better nonacademic ratings and were generally more multidimensionally excellent or solid. So Michael could be forgiven for not understanding that investing another few thousand hours into his piano practice to further cultivate his most distinguishing excellence risked branding himself as a one-dimensional star.\n\nWe may not know what a distinguishing excellence is, but we certainly know what it's not. It's not working at Taco Bell or Burger King. Jobs only came up twice in Card's report-each time to say that Arcidiacono hadn't considered them, but never to say how much weight Harvard attached to them. That's because Harvard doesn't attach any explicit weight to jobs. If the college gives a tip to a socioeconomically disadvantaged student, it is in spite of their disadvantage, not because of it. No one views working a near-full-time job-as almost all my City University of New York students do-as a virtue that should count toward acceptance.\n\nSFFA's case is complicated by a simple truth: It's probably not Harvard's direct aim to disadvantage Asian applicants. Harvard's admissions office is reasonably diverse, and during the trial several of the officers adamantly denied any animus or conscious prejudice. When one Asian-American admissions officer was asked her reaction to the allegations at trial, she said, \"It's not what I know our office to be. It's not who I am. I would never be part of a process that would discriminate against anyone, let alone people that looked like me, like my family, like my friends, like my daughter.\"\n\nUS District Court Judge Allison Burroughs credited the staffer's testimony in ruling for Harvard, and she was probably right to do so, though it's easy to be skeptical given the Ivy League's historical transgressions. James Conant, who served as Harvard's president from 1933 to 1953, was part of an admissions committee that suggested using letters of recommendation and interviews to assess \"aptitude and character\" as a way of addressing the so-called Jewish problem-too many Jewish kids qualifying for coveted Ivy acceptances. The notion of the Yale man-of \"sound physique\" and \"grace of body\"-evolved to combat what was known in New Haven as the \"Hebrew invasion.\" So, too, Princeton's commitment to educating \"leaders,\" not \"bookworms.\"\n\nIn the years since, elite colleges have made undeniable strides in improving the racial diversity of their classes-even if, almost certainly, it's also true that Asians have been disadvantaged by some of the policies that have promoted these broader gains and that diversity gains overall have been limited by universities' steadfast commitment to preserving ALDC tips.\n\nIf SFFA v. Harvard were about socioeconomic status rather than race, there could be no doubt as to Harvard's intent. Every experience valued by elite colleges is directly correlated with wealth. The experiences that allow young people to \"distinguish\" themselves are not uniformly available-not by a long shot. About 90 percent of students from families in the top US income quartile participate in school-based extracurriculars, whereas only 65 percent of students from the lowest quartile do. Nearly one-third of those low-income students participate in neither sports nor club activities. (The overall nonparticipation rate is 10 percent.)\n\nUsing survey data from the National Center for Education Statistics, a team including Robert Putnam-whose book Our Kids: The American Dream in Crisis lays out a damning indictment of the nation's exploding opportunity gap-found that affluent high schools offer about twice as many team sports as schools in high-poverty neighborhoods do. Those schools are also far less likely to require students to pay to play, as many poorer schools do-even in California, where the practice has been ruled unconstitutional. (Administrators evade the legal requirement by calling the fees \"donations.\")\n\nWhen the sociologists Elizabeth Stearns and Elizabeth Glennie used high school yearbooks to explore extracurricular opportunities in North Carolina, they found a similar pattern. Affluent schools offered more activities and had higher participation rates. This continuing disparity creates a vicious cycle because the experiences that allow students to distinguish themselves in the college application process also help keep kids in school. Poorer kids, already at higher risk of dropping out, have less opportunity to have the kind of experience that makes a young person love school and feel loved by it.\n\nAs damning as all of this is, the picture is even bleaker when we probe deeper into the breadth and quality of extracurricular experiences. Putnam's team found that a high school senior from a rich family is about twice as likely as one from a poorer family to have served as a sports team captain. They also found significant gaps in access to private music, dance, and art lessons.\n\nParticipating in a high-quality Model United Nations program seems like the sort of experience that could change a young person's life, and maybe even help them get into college. Of the Top 25 ranked Model UN programs, 10 are housed in private schools. Of the remaining 15, only one is hosted by a school whose student body is more than 10 percent Black. It's no coincidence that Harvard and other elite colleges offer a proliferation of niche sports such as squash, fencing, and crew, that many disadvantaged kids have barely heard of, let alone participated in. A staggering 70 percent of recruited athletes at Harvard are white-a mere 3 percent of those white athletes are from economically disadvantaged families.\n\nIn 2017, Elizabeth Heaton, a college consultant who worked as an admissions officer at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote a piece for the Huffington Post titled, \"What Kind of Hook Do I Need to Get Accepted to an Ivy League College?\" It's all about those distinguishing excellences, she argued. Being an Eagle Scout isn't a distinguishing excellence, Heaton explained, because 50,000 kids achieve that rank every year. Valedictorians are a dime a dozen. So, too, are class presidents. Creating a nonprofit that solicits $1,000 and serves 500 meals isn't a distinguishing excellence either. \"But it can become one,\" she wrote, \"if you are raising $100,000 and serving 500,000 meals.\" Her other examples included a debate champion, a \"future global leader fluent in eight languages,\" a USA Biology Olympiad winner, and a student who runs regional volunteer efforts for a US Senate campaign.\n\nIt's hard to imagine a child of even ordinary means having any of these experiences. All are available only to families with wealth and connections. Who else has the access to get-and can afford to take-an unpaid internship in a high-profile political campaign? What child of ordinary means can win a science olympiad? For a fee, Heaton's organization, Bright Horizons College Coach, will help you build a science profile that should suffice as a distinguishing excellence. Its Research Mentorship Program will match you \"with a researcher from a top institution, such as Harvard, Princeton, Oxford, and MIT.\" The goal is to develop a college-level research project that's \"a meaningful addition\" to the college application. It also includes 10 mentoring sessions and help getting the work published or presented at a conference. Be forewarned: This program is only available to purchasers of the Premier and Elite plans.\n\nBecause college admissions officers may not be familiar with reverse-transcriptase inhibitors or machine-learning algorithms, distinguishing research needs to be translated into accessible language. Ideally, this language should include a narrative of personal growth that syncs with the sort of diversity that Harvard and its brethren value. Not to worry. Ivy Coach, Bright Horizons, and all the private college counselors will be more than happy to \"edit\" your college essays.\n\nMaddeningly, but unsurprisingly, a team of researchers at Stanford found that the quality of an applicant's essays has an even stronger correlation to reported household income than to their SAT score. Surely professional editing is exacerbating this disparity. Yet no elite college has a policy against this sort of assistance, even though it'd be easy to imagine, as Princeton Review founder John Katzman has proposed, requiring that students write their essays while sitting for one of the standardized exams.\n\nStill, that's not the worst of it. Elite colleges exacerbate the hoarding of opportunity by attaching value to distinguishing excellences. The message to parents is that they need to expose their children to elite extracurricular experiences to get them into elite colleges. This shapes the communities in which they live. Yet, paradoxically, almost everyone in the academy embraces the research (and often their own teaching experience) showing that the best predictors of wellbeing and achievement are characteristics like resilience, not academic or extracurricular brilliance.\n\nExtracurriculars aren't a reflection of a person's inner wealth or value but of their opportunities. Working at Taco Bell or Burger King while going to high school isn't something to be looked down upon. Rather, it's a marker of resilience and a predictor of success-if only those students who need to work can overcome the prejudice against their experience and get themselves through those gilded gates. But there's the rub. Working takes hours away from the time-intensive extracurriculars that elite colleges value.\n\nAt my stepson's public high school commencement in a relatively affluent suburb, the school's guidance director told parents that their children's graduation was proof that \"anyone can succeed.\" She explained, \"It's just a matter of hard work.\" Richard Rothstein, who wrote about the sordid history of racial redlining in his 2017 bestseller, The Color of Law , calls the belief that children born into low-income families can escape that status through hard work and education \"a fantasy that we share.\" It's a fantasy in part because elite colleges don't value hard work-or at least not hard work as it's understood by and available to ordinary people. Instead, these schools value distinguishing excellences available only to the wealthy, and act as if weighing these experiences is the only conceivable mechanism by which to select capable students.\n\nIt isn't.\n\nAfter graduating from Brandeis, Deborah Bial worked briefly as a paralegal, then took a job at CityKids, a foundation that uses art to help at-risk children find their voices. While there, she met a young man nicknamed Stein-short for Einstein-who'd given up a scholarship at a major university. When Bial asked why he'd dropped out, Stein said, \"I could have done it if I had had my posse with me.\"\n\nStein's comment inspired Bial to start the Posse Foundation. It sends scholarship students in groups of 10-posses-to participating colleges so that they can support one another. The approach has been extraordinarily successful. Posse currently recruits students from 20 cities and has 63 partner colleges. Since its creation in 1989, Posse has selected more than 10,000 scholars who have received a cumulative $1.8 billion in scholarships. In 2007, Bial was awarded the prestigious MacArthur Foundation fellowship.\n\nPosse is amazing, but Bial didn't get a $500,000 so-called genius grant merely for sending kids to college in groups. She won it for how she picked the kids. Even in the late 1980s, Bial understood that the SAT systematically disadvantaged poor students, especially those who are Black or brown. She understood, too, long before the renowned psychologist Angela Duckworth recognized the power of determination, that people with the highest grades weren't the ones who went on to succeed. If Bial wanted to cultivate a new generation of disadvantaged students who would go on to become leaders in their colleges and communities, she would need a different way to select people.\n\nSo she developed a test that measures initiative and persistence through group activities. The Bial-Dale College Adaptability Index is sometimes called the \"Lego Test\" because of a 10-minute segment that asks groups of students to reproduce a robot made of Lego blocks. The students are allowed to examine the structure individually but are prohibited from taking notes. Success requires cooperation and teamwork. In another part of the three-hour exam, rather than mirroring the traditional college interview, students are asked to lead a group discussion on a random topic. Observers note not who has the biggest vocabulary, but rather who collaborates well and who shows resilience.\n\nHow well does it work? Even though Posse is choosing among the most underserved students, those at the greatest risk of dropping out, more than 90 percent graduate. It's difficult to imagine more definitive proof of something we all know in our hearts: The college interview is a scam. Unstructured interviews are notoriously bad at predicting future performance. What they do, rather, is reproduce social inequalities. People like people like them. So, the college interview becomes an exploration of shared experiences, even though many of those experiences are unavailable to poor applicants of color and an alternative system exists that's better at predicting success. The sociologist Lauren Rivera has shown the same mechanisms at work in hiring at top law firms, investment banks, and management consulting companies.\n\nEven admissions practices that seem touchy-feely can skew the odds in the wrong direction. For instance, in the wake of widespread criticism that privileged families game the standardized-testing process, many colleges-including many of the Ivies-have made themselves test optional. But applicants can still submit SAT and ACT scores when it benefits them. That's very different from schools that have made themselves \"test-blind,\" like the University of California, which no longer considers test scores at all.\n\n\"Superscoring\" is even more offensive. That's the common practice of counting only a student's highest score from individual sections of the exam. The more times you take the exam, the greater your likelihood of having a superscore that exceeds your actual average. You can probably guess who takes these tests over and over. Economist Joshua Goodman, then at Harvard's Kennedy School, and his collaborators looked at 10 million SAT takers from 2006 through 2014. Low-income students, they found, were 21 percent less likely to retake the exam-even though retaking it was worth about 90 points on the super-score and increased a low-income student's chance of enrolling at a four-year college by nearly 30 . The effect was so strong, the authors concluded , that it explained about a quarter of the enrollment gap between low- and high-income students.\n\nMost tragically, the status quo represents a lost opportunity. Imagine if we told communities that the skills elite colleges valued were cooperation, hard work, and listening. To be sure, the rich will learn to manipulate any system to sustain their class position. But think about what it would do for the perception of working-class people to signal that holding a real job signified something of honor and predicted success, instead of treating it as a disadvantage. Consider, too, what communities would look like if instead of creating incentives to hoard extracurricular opportunities and hire $100,000 consultants, colleges instead encouraged young people to be the best team players they could be.\n\nIt's almost inevitable that the Supreme Court will dispense with affirmative action in the near future. That day will be tragic in a host of regards. Although reasonable minds can differ on whom should be given preference in college admissions, it's hard to argue against the proposition that Harvard and other elite colleges-many of which were built with slave labor and with the benefit of racist housing practices-owe a debt to at least some of their applicants of color. But this obligation will almost certainly go unmet.\n\nAnd it will largely be Harvard's fault. No admissions system will ever be without controversy, but it's important to remember how much opportunity Harvard could have created by ending its most offensive practices, such as tips for ALDCs. It could have admitted more Asian American applicants with high test scores and more socioeconomically disadvantaged students. Instead, the college acted as if the leg up it has historically afforded to affluent students is sacred, and in doing so it effectively pitted disadvantaged groups against one another. When the court ends affirmative action for low-income students of color, it will be the result of Harvard's indignant commitment to affirmative action for wealthy white kids.\n\nChart statistics compiled by Mother Jones senior editor Michael Mechanic from Ivy Plus websites (acceptance rates, testing policies); Harvard Crimson (class of 2019 survey); Raj Chetty et al .

      "text": "The Rich History and Underestimated Political Clout of the Black Working Class\n\nMother Jones; Katrina Wittkamp\n\nThe 2024 presidential election cycle has begun, and the white working class once more has commanded the spotlight. Pollsters obsess over how their economic struggles and resentments influence their political choices. Democrats and Republicans jockey to win their favor, each promising- through different cultural and political appeals-to address their individual and collective needs while igniting a new era of economic prosperity.\n\nBut where in this landscape are the direct appeals to the Black working class? This is a group that has experienced political and economic turmoil like few others, while simultaneously expanding the possibilities of the American political system. As Blair Kelley, an acclaimed, award-winning historian of Black history at UNC-Chapel Hill, writes in her new book, Black Folk: The Roots of the Black Working Class, \"When Black workers are mentioned, the idea of work is often dropped, instead it becomes a discussion about the poor .\" But, in fact, Black workers are the backbone of the labor force. Or as Kelley puts it, \"More than 28 percent of 42 million Black people in America today-the majority of the Black working class-are essential workers.\"\n\nIn Kelley's hands, modern labor struggles-from UPS workers fighting for a fair contract to Amazon workers demanding better working conditions - become historical epics made possible by the contributions of Black workers centuries ago. We can see the roots of solidarity between poor white workers and rich white capitalists, and how Black workers became a critical force for civil rights. We meet Black laundresses who brought cities to a grinding halt during Reconstruction by organizing powerful unions within a year of leaving slavery.\n\nIn their struggles and the fabric of their lives, Kelley discovers patterns that help to explain the current political landscape. The trajectory of this history led to the 2020 election when the support of Black working-class voters catapulted candidate Joe Biden to the Democratic nomination and then the presidency. You can see how that electoral bloc made the impossible possible by flipping Georgia despite a global pandemic and widespread voter suppression. As we approach the 2024 presidential race, Black Folk feels especially timely in its compelling argument about the important role Black workers play in shoring up American democracy. I caught up with Blair Kelly over Zoom from her office in Chapel Hill.\n\nThere's been seemingly endless political and media attention on the white working class, but so little focus on the Black working class. Who is the Black working class? What made you decide to write a book about them?\n\nAt first, I thought this wasn't the book for me. I'm not a labor historian or someone who has been studying unions exclusively for a long time. When my editor asked what a book from my perspective as a scholar of Black history would look like, I realized my family was at the heart of how I could approach the question. My family members weren't necessarily famous labor organizers or people who led wildcat strikes. They worked jobs. They had relationships within the communities that supported them. I wanted to start with them and the humanity behind those who work.\n\nI define the term \"Black working class\" broadly. It's probably broader than most scholars might frame it because the book begins with enslavement, and a good Marxist would never start with enslavement. You would begin when people are free. But for me, the roots of Black working people start in our history of being in bondage in this country, our relationships to those institutions, and the ways in which we built community, resistance, and life in spite of enslavement.\n\nYou describe Black churches during enslavement as a \"launching pad for working-class organization.\" Do you see that spirit in modern Black churches today, or has that legacy shifted?\n\nOur churches are so different from where our forebearers' were. For one thing, there were no megachurches coming out of enslavement. In the traditional church spaces that still exist, I do see some things that strengthen the working-class community. Encouraging young people to build their voices, for example. Churches are often the first place where young people speak, sing, or play an instrument. There's encouragement for people to serve and lead. And to complicate ideas of who should be in leadership, it doesn't matter if you're a PhD or a postal worker. In traditional church spaces, those outside assumptions can melt away.\n\nBut the number of churches like that is decreasing over time because of the pull towards prosperity gospel - that preaches if God is blessing you, you're wealthy, financially free , and successful. And that's not where we come from as a people. The roots of Black Christianity are about believing that you are God's chosen, in spite of the fact that you don't have the worldly things people use to measure success. It was about the justice that you knew would come, if not in this life then the next.\n\nTo me, the prosperity gospel is anathema to thinking about holding up and supporting a Black working class. We face structural challenges that provide us with a world where most Black people are not going to be wealthy, and that shouldn't make people think, well God doesn't love me.\n\nDo you believe Black churches are still radical spaces?\n\nThey can be. I belong to a traditional Black church. I'm in leadership and my husband is too. And I believe in Black institutions. I mean look at where I am. I'm a professor at UNC-Chapel Hill. This is an embattled space; it's one of the roots of the affirmative action case. I'm here because it's a state institution that admits Black students, working-class people, and students from rural communities who want the best education they can get in their home state. And I believe in that project.\n\nI've been in all kinds of institutions that are problematic-Duke, UVA, NC State-and yet, I believed in the possibility of those institutions. So why in the hell would I not believe in the possibility of Black institutions? Why would I say Black institutions have flawed histories and should be disposed of? And then be in white institutions, that have flawed histories about my own people, and then say we can work it out! I believe we should inhabit Black spaces even when they are deeply imperfect.\n\nCan the roots of the white working class be found in slavery as well?\n\nAbsolutely. The greatest trick ever played on the white working class was to get them to invest in a system that kept them poorer than they should have been. Slavery is a disinvestment in free-working people. If you're just a regular white person with no land or enslaved people, this wasn't a system you were able to double dutch your way into. Your wages would be suppressed by the existence of enslaved people. So, wealthy white people got poor white people to buy into some notion of race that would make them feel equal in status and as if everything was fine. I think that trick is still being played.\n\nWhite working-class people need many of the same things as Black, Brown, and Asian working-class people do: health care, good schools, livable wages, higher education for their children. And yet people are still so invested in suppressing or being afraid of someone else that they aren't really considering their own positionality.\n\nBiden couldn't have won without the Black working class. How has writing this book shaped your understanding of that group's political priorities?\n\nRecognition is key. What happened in Georgia is a great example of that. Stacey Abrams and a whole panoply of Black organizations went to places that traditional candidates rarely go to and made it clear that they wanted to hear from those communities. That was so powerful it changed the electoral map and what was possible in a state like Georgia.\n\nThe recognition of their existence and prioritizing the questions that they want to ask is important. If you go to different parts of the country, you're going to get different answers. In some places , it's environmental justice. Rural, working-class Black people live in some of the most toxic places in the world. If you're in urban spaces, the decay and abandonment of cities are likely important. People want investment in their communities, safe places for their kids. They want education and a decent wage. They're ready for the possibility of change, but it starts with the recognition of the particularities of their vulnerabilities.\n\nThis seems like a very pragmatic group of voters. Where do you think that pragmatism comes from?\n\nThere's less focus on the particularities of the person representing you compared to what they actually get done. You can see that from a whole series of Black mayors who didn't have the chops to get things done and were more invested in their own stuff. If there's someone who knows how to get things done and can listen and understand how things work in their local communities, that's what Black working-class voters care the most about. That's what Biden represents. He was the most pragmatic-looking person in the previous election.\n\nYour book reveals labor struggles that have rarely seen the light of day. I was so captivated by the post-Civil War strike waves set off by Black laundresses. Can you talk about Black domestic workers as a political force?\n\nTara Hunter's book To 'Joy My Freedom is an incredible account of the Atlanta Washerwomen's Strike of 1881 when 3,000 of the city's laundresses organized a union to demand better pay and labor conditions during the Atlanta Exposition. But that strike happened on a smaller scale everywhere.\n\nBlack washerwomen set the terms of their employment from the very first moment of emancipation. They refused to wash clothes on holidays. People wanted them to wash multiple loads in a week, to set the timelines for their work, and they said no. In 1865, Black washerwomen organized a union in Jackson, Mississippi. Who comes out of enslavement and organizes a union immediately? That tells you everything you need to know about who enslaved people were. It's a reminder that workers don't need someone to raise their consciousness. They don't need someone to come teach them about what's oppressive about what they do or the power they wield when they come together. They might need the resources of a union, but they damn sure don't need directions.\n\nWhat are some other major pivotal moments within Black working-class history?\n\nI loved having the chance to write about the Pullman Porters and Black postal workers. They are that bridge between just working a job and making it a transformational collective enterprise. The Pullman Porters, like the washerwomen, could take advantage of the monopoly that they had on employment. George Mortimer Pullman wanted Black men to work on his sleeping cars. He pictured a sort of antebellum romantic version of travel would of course have a Black man servant waiting on you hand and foot. And those men became cosmopolitan leaders within the Black community, known for their mobility and knowledge. And when they formed a union, they used that platform to amplify demands from other workers.\n\nThe Pullman Porters powered the March on Washington movement, which started in the 1930s, and ultimately led to the 1963 March on Washington . Postal workers are the same. The first Black men who do postal service work are venerated Civil War veterans, and they had to fight hard against the myth of the Black male rapist just to deliver some mail and have a decent job. And many of them died. They were murdered by mobs in their effort to do postal work. That's something we don't think about. But their labor sets the groundwork for a civil rights generation that fights for access to federal jobs, which was a powerful counter to state-by-state segregation.\n\nDo you think the demise of race-conscious admissions will affect the Black working class?\n\nI have thought that affirmative action was going away my whole adult life-the argument against it has been so profound and hostile, and the ground on which most people discuss it is so a-historical. People talk about affirmative action like it's just about diversity and wanting to see different-looking people in a room when it's about historic exclusion. We're in the middle of a complicated reparations discussion around the country. Affirmative action could have been thought of in those terms-but it's gone.\n\nThe pathways that make it difficult to attend elite institutions are fraught and difficult for working-class communities because of the structural forces that make education unequal in this country. The things that tie the quality of education to housing and zip code. Those are fundamental injustices that, as a country, we are not interested in addressing. So, the narrow pipeline that pulls people out of under-resourced communities and into elite institutions just got narrower.\n\nBut as I said earlier, I believe in Black institutions. I am thankful that HBCUs still exist. I am hopeful that Black communities will begin to further invest in the experiences of HBCU students. I don't think that there's a legal means by which we can really contest this change, but I think enriching what the broader set of possibilities are for Black students should be the work.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Treasury Department Study: White People Get 90 Percent of the Benefits of Many Tax Breaks\n\nPatrick Sison/AP\n\nOne of the little-noticed moves by President Biden in his first days in office was an executive order that required federal agencies to examine their policies and programs to identify whether and how they perpetuate barriers to equal opportunity. It was a stab at addressing structural inequality in the wake of the national protests over the death of George Floyd. At least some of that work seems to be coming to fruition.\n\nThis week, the Treasury Department released a study looking at racial disparities in the benefits that come through the tax code-like special lower tax rates for capital gains or deductions for employer-provided health insurance. In theory, these policies are color-blind. But the Treasury report shows that they are anything but.\n\nTax expenditures have become a popular tool in Congress to provide benefits to families that otherwise would be bigger targets for budget cutters. They don't show up as program expenses the way anti-poverty programs like food stamps or TANF benefits do. But the differences are staggering. Consider TANF, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, otherwise known as welfare. Congress has refused to increase the block grant for the program since its inception in 1996, so it's been stuck at $16.5 billion, with its real value falling by 40 percent thanks to inflation. In many states, the maximum monthly TANF benefit to a poor family with a single parent and two kids is a pittance, particularly in states where many Black people live below the poverty line. In Alabama, for instance, the maximum benefit for a family of three is just $215, a figure that hasn't budged since 2005.\n\nCompare the TANF budget to the loss of revenue to the government caused by the special treatment of capital gains, investment income that's taxed at a much lower rate than ordinary wages. In 2023, Treasury researchers estimate that tax break will cost the country $146 billion, or nine times more than the entire annual TANF budget. And who are the major beneficiaries of those tax breaks? White families, who make up 67 percent of the population but claim 92 percent of the benefits. And these aren't just white families. They're rich white families. The Treasury report doesn't mention it, but 75 percent of all long-term capital gains were reported by the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans in 2019. (For a good explanation of how this works, read this piece by Mother Jones editor Mike Mechanic, author of Jackpot: How the Super Rich Really Live and How Their Wealth Harms Us All .)\n\nBy far the biggest tax expenditure is the exemption for employer-provided health insurance, which will cost the country $225 billion this year. Eighty-two percent of those benefits will accrue to white people. See a pattern? You don't have to be a woke SJW to see the injustice here.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Of Course Trump Will Get Away With Criming While Wealthy and White\n\nCheriss May/Zuma\n\nAs we all know, once again, former President Donald Trump is on trial. But let's be clear at the onset, this is not a criminal proceeding, but a political one. After the former president incited a mob to attack the Capitol to halt the certification of Joe Biden's victory, the insurrection he inspired led to the death of five people, including one police officer, and dozens of injuries including stab wounds and cracked ribs , and two deaths by suicide . On January 13, Trump was impeached once again by the House, this time for inciting the January 6 insurrection. Among his other notable accomplishments, he's the only president to have been impeached twice.\n\nBut here is where this political trial has strong parallels with what happens in the criminal justice system. When all is said and done, the former president and insurrection inciter is likely to join the long list of wealthy white men who've walked away from their crimes without a guilty verdict, and without facing any real consequences for what they have done.\n\nWhat's happening in the Senate, as the House impeachment managers present compelling and powerful evidence of the former president's culpability for the deadly events that transpired on January 6, can be seen as a microcosm of what happens when wealthy white people are put in the position of holding one of their own accountable. Even with a shoddy defense and clear evidence of wrongdoing, the facts of the case matter much less than the identity of the perpetrator.\n\nI have watched all of the events of January 6 and its aftermath, and yet the House managers' presentation of a single terrifying narrative revealed the true nature of the danger-and how much worse it would have been were it not for law enforcement officials seeking to protect legislators, quick-thinking congressional staffers, and frankly, no small measure of luck. If the days and weeks after the attack felt like a painful slow drip, the Democrats' presentation was a firehose.\n\nOn Tuesday, they showed a 13-minute video that took viewers methodically through the events of January 6, beginning with Trump's comments at his \"Stop the Steal\" rally that preceded the attack. On Wednesday, the impeachment managers introduced images that had never been seen before, including security footage that showed US Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman directing Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) away from the mob , likely saving his life. Goodman is also notable for having led the mob away from the Senate doors on the day of the attack. Radio calls were played from police officers who described the rioters assaulting them with metal poles and other weapons. It also showed how many times the mob came dangerously close to lawmakers, including 100 feet away from where former Vice President Mike Pence was sheltering with his family. Throughout their rampage, the mob threatened Pence, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and other lawmakers with violence, even death.\n\nThe criminal justice system historically has failed to hold wealthy, white, and well-connected men accountable for their transgressions. (Though in recent years, the # MeToo movement has made strides to hold privileged men accountable.) Studies have shown that prosecutors are more likely to hand down harsher sentences for drug offenses for people of color, despite the fact that the drug usage rate is similar among racial groups. When it comes to murder, prosecutors are more likely to pursue death sentences when the victim is white, even though Black people are just as likely to be the victims of murder.\n\nIn much the same way as the system tends to defer to the perpetrator when egregious crimes are committed by the privileged, so too have some Republican senators when crimes were committed by their president. On Tuesday, the Washington Post reported that Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Rick Scott (R-Fl.), Marco Rubio (R-Fl.), and Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) averted their eyes from the screen during the first video played by the House impeachment managers that showed the violence unfolding during the attack. On Wednesday there were reports that some GOP Senators-who are supposed to be playing the role of impartial jurors-simply left the Senate floor.\n\nSome GOP senators have opted to watch the proceedings from their cloak room. We can't see them in there so it's unknown if they were watching it.\n\n- Manu Raju (@mkraju) February 10, 2021\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, one of the main proponents of the lie that the election had been stolen, reportedly relaxed with his feet up on his desk as the impeachment managers played footage of the chaos that day. No matter how compelling the case for Trump's guilt the House Democrats present, it's a foregone conclusion that the chances of the Senate convicting the former president with a two-thirds majority remain infinitesimal. This would require 17 Republicans to have the courage to break their loyalty to Trump. Our broken and ineffectual Senate probably couldn't even get two-thirds majority support for the idea that the sky is blue.\n\nLet's interrogate those forces that conspire to enable Trump to get off scot-free. Spoiler alert: They're the same forces that typically accommodate white supremacy. In a moment of unusual truth-telling, Trump was actually correct to bill himself as the president of \"law and order\"- if you consider that \"law and order\" has just been another way of sanctioning the subjugation of Black people, also known as white supremacy. Or, put simply, \"Consequences for thee, not for me.\"\n\nHow badly does the Republican Party not want Trump to face the consequences of his hideous incitement? Senate Republicans tried to stop the trial from even happening by holding a vote on whether the trial was constitutional. A slim majority voted yes, it was perfectly constitutional to try a former president. So on the first day of the trial, the Senate debated the very same topic. Then, there's the \"ignorance is bliss\" approach. On the third day of the trial, CBS reported that there were many Republicans who had decided just to skip the unpleasantness the impeachment managers were doling out. (Much like so many claimed not to have heard or read some of Trump's most appalling statements or tweets.)\n\nThere were \"at least 15 to 17 empty Republican seats\" during part of Thursday's impeachment trial arguments, @edokeefe reports https://t.co/YubPpuDO6i pic.twitter.com/fQLS8uqiWr\n\n- CBS News (@CBSNews) February 11, 2021\n\nOne long tradition in the miscarriage of justice against Black defendants has been the appointment of often shamefully incompetent defense attorneys. In capital punishment cases, whether a defendant will be sentenced to death typically depends on the quality of their counsel more than anything else. Even in non-death penalty cases, the quality of lawyer can make a world of difference between a short sentence and a long one. But for those lucky enough to benefit from white privilege, we see that a pathetic defense doesn't really matter.\n\nAfter rigorous and scathing opening statements from House impeachment managers, Trump's defense lawyer, Bruce Castor, took to the floor. His meandering, 48-minute opening statement bore a striking resemblance to Trump's stream-of-consciousness rants, but without the authoritarian eloquence. There was nothing coherent about this defense attorney. The Democrats had made a powerful argument about why the trial was well within the confines of the Constitution, but Castor's counter to this argument was tantamount to his declaring that he had a bowl of cereal for breakfast.\n\nHis performance did have the benefit of inspiring in some Republican senatorial fans of Trump a rare spasm of self-awareness. These are all elected officials who have utterly debased themselves as Trump supporters. Even though they were once concerned about his toxicity , they all became his most ardent fans. Which perhaps explains their disappointment in the less than vigorous defense. \"I thought I knew where it was going, and I really didn't know where it was going,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said afterward, speaking for nearly everyone watching at home.\n\nEven @LindseyGrahamSC says the Trump legal team was hard to follow:\n\n\"I thought I knew where it was going, and I really didn't know where it was going.\"\n\n- Seung Min Kim (@seungminkim) February 9, 2021\n\n\"The first lawyer just rambled on and on and on and didn't really address the Constitutional argument,\" Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) complained. \"That was it was not one of the finest I've seen.\"\n\nLots of criticism from Republicans over Trump attorney Castor. John Cornyn:\"And then I thought the President's lawyer the first lawyer just rambled on and on and on and didn't really address the constitutional argument. That was it was not one of the finest I've seen.\"\n\n- Manu Raju (@mkraju) February 9, 2021\n\n\"I don't think the lawyers did the most effective job,\" allowed Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who, to be clear, was leading the \"stop-the-steal\" charge in the Senate.\n\n\"I don't think the lawyers did the most effective job,\" said Sen. Ted Cruz to @karoun when asked about Trump's lawyers. He added that Rep. Jamie Raskin was \"impressive\" and a \"serious lawyer.\"\n\n- Manu Raju (@mkraju) February 9, 2021\n\nAnd yet, even as inconsistent as Castor's word vomit was, it did not cause any of Trump's fan base to question their positions, much less go so far as to look at the evidence before them. The inadequate defense was inadequate because what Trump did was indefensible. Castor's performance just highlighted the problem at hand. So as dug into their positions as they were, nothing could convince Republicans that the trial was, in fact, constitutional.\n\nThese Republican senators know that Castor and David Schoen, Trump's other defense lawyer, did not present the argument that the trial itself was unconstitutional effectively. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) was the only Republican to switch his vote at the end of the four-hour session, and joined five other Republicans who said the Constitution allowed for the Senate to try a former president. Forty-five Republicans held their ground and voted no-the proceedings were not constitutional-including those mentioned above. For them, the basic argument to absolve Trump of any responsibility boils down to this: Donald Trump, and by extension everyone like him, is above the law. Punishment, accountability, and consequences only rarely apply to rich white men.\n\nThis commitment to upholding the racial hierarchy and the continued solidarity Trump inspires boggles the mind. It is encapsulated by a comment from Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) on the eve of the impeachment trial. \"Look, everyone makes mistakes,\" he said on Fox News . \"Everyone is entitled to a mulligan once in a while.\" There's a lot going on here. First, this is an exquisite pander to the former golfer-in-chief who, no doubt, was glued to Fox News. But then, let's look at the metaphor. According to the New York Times , in golf, a mulligan means \"allowing an opponent to take a second shot after an errant first swing without incurring any penalty on the official scorecard.\" This is the language of elites enjoying themselves at country clubs. What a perfect shorthand for generations of white privilege.\n\nDespite all the riveting evidence, most Republican senators are not pretending they care about the fact that Trump could be guilty of inciting an insurrection. I've watched countless videos of white police officers shooting, killing, and injuring people of color. At least, those law enforcement officials, when accused of racism or wrongdoing, have had the decency to argue that they believed they were doing their jobs. But Team Trump isn't even bothering to defend what he's accused of. It's almost as if they're saying, yes, he incited an insurrection but let's move on.\n\nLike most of us in this country, I remember the events of January 6 clearly. Since then, I've watched innumerable images of the insurrectionists using flag poles and their firsts to attack police officers, parade around the Capitol building chanting death threats, brandishing Confederate flags, and rifling through lawmakers' desks. And still, watching elected officials weave it all together in one place, it's impossible to imagine how anyone could watch these presentations and not walk away secure in the fact that Donald Trump must face consequences?\n\nEnter Sen. Lindsey Graham. Once a fierce critic of Trump before he won the election , he became one of his most craven lackeys and enablers. But even Graham, on the night of the insurrection, gathered his courage to disavow the president. \"Count me out,\" he said . \"Enough is enough.\" Within days, he returned to his favored supine position as Trump supplicant. The presentations, he said, only deepened his commitment to the former president.\n\nThe 'Not Guilty' vote is growing after today.\n\nI think most Republicans found the presentation by the House Managers offensive and absurd.\n\n- Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) February 11, 2021\n\nOnly those Republican senators committed to whiteness and wielding power could sit through this and vote to acquit, much less demean the heartfelt and urgent presentation by their House colleagues as \"offensive and absurd.\" But why should they behave any differently than they always have? Our flawed and racially biased system of justice has never required them to.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Black tech execs don't mince words over Silicon Valley failures\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Ja'han Jones\n\nI always relish the opportunity to nerd out with fellow techies on The ReidOut Blog . Especially when we get a little existential with it.\n\nSo it was a treat to sit down with executives of Blavity, the Black media and technology company, to talk about where and how race intersects with the high-tech revolution we're seeing across all industries these days.\n\nMy tech-centric blog posts have all been premised on a similar foundation: my belief that diversity is the only way to stem inequality (in everything from agriculture to art sales) that is sure to worsen if the levers of power in Big Tech are controlled by a few rich white dudes - which is largely the case now.\n\nAnd there's a war underway to wrest control of these levers.\n\nWith that in mind, you may remember that the idea of Big Tech diversity was criticized after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank , when a Wall Street Journal columnist pointed to racial and gender diversity on the bank's board as a factor.\n\nThat prompted a written response from Morgan DeBaun, Blavity's founder and CEO; Jeff Nelson, a co-founder and Blavity's chief operating officer; and Simone White, senior vice president of Blavity's AFROTECH brand (essentially, a hub for news about Black business and technology).\n\nTheir piece, headlined \" White Men Prove Incapable Of Handling More Than One Task At A Time ,\" turns the tables on right-wingers who allege emphasizing diversity is a detriment to businesses - whether SVB or anywhere else.\n\nThey wrote that the WSJ op-ed \"entertained the classic argument that focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion was distracting from the 'real' business of running Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). How original and worthy of publication!\"\n\nBut here's the rub, so to speak, as they put it:\n\nThose who promote this idea seem oblivious to the fact that they are essentially admitting that homogeneous leadership teams are incapable of multitasking. If incorporating the perspectives of women, LGBTQ, and Black people is enough to cause a group of white men to fail in leading SVB, then they were not competent to manage a bank in the first place.\n\nIt's startling to me that we don't hear this argument more often in relation to right-wing attacks on diversity and inclusion policies, whether in school or the workplace.\n\nThis conservative crusade isn't merely sinister; it's also just stupid. As in, it rejects the demonstrable proof that diverse environments allow for enlightening conversation and cultural exchanges that in turn lead to more enjoyable and more effective workplaces.\n\nAnd that - not bleeding heart liberalism - is precisely why so many institutions emphasize diversity.\n\nBut as many conservatives look to turn \"diversity\" into a taboo, Blavity is going in the opposite direction.\n\nAhead of this year's AFROTECH Conference in November, Blavity just unveiled a platform, called Talent Infusion , that will allow tech firms easy access to a pool of résumés, including many submitted by conference attendees.\n\nIt's one way to connect Black techies with organizations doing work in their field, and it's a step toward eliminating company executives' excuses that they can't find any qualified Black talent.\n\n\"Sometimes, it seems like the conversations we're having just about diversity, race relations, inclusion, acceptance in 2023 are more regressive than they were in the 1980s,\" Nelson told me. But he says he's optimistic that more data has been compiled in recent years showing that diversity is a winner for workplaces .\n\n\"All the research and data show, as I've said ad nauseam, that diversity yields better outcomes,\" he said. \"That's why we were so provocative with the op-ed and why there was an exasperated tone with the op-ed: because the proof is there if you're someone who claims to be a believer in data, science and evidence.\"\n\nThat's a great summation of both Blavity's message and what many Black techies are saying to Big Tech firms these days: What's good for us is good for you. Blavity and its executives are smart to explain to firms why a diverse workforce will help them (even if the evidence ought to be clear by now).\n\nBut these executives are also clear that their mission is to build Black power in the tech space.\n\n\"As our community has grown over the last few years, we're not only saying we're here,\" White said. \"We don't want to be in just entry-level positions. We don't want a small percentage of the funding venture capitalists are giving out. We actually want our fair share.\"\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

      "text": "We've finally found the true 'welfare queen.' It's Clarence Thomas.\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Ja'han Jones\n\nThe irony is too rich to ignore.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas , someone who has loudly loathed Black people receiving things from the government, has received lavish gifts from a rich benefactor while in his powerful government job .\n\nHarlan Crow, the right-wing billionaire, Nazi memorabilia collector and Thomas crony, has been placed under the spotlight amid ProPublica's reporting that he has lavished luxury vacations and other gifts on the Supreme Court justice. (A Washington Post report published over the weekend on another anomaly from Thomas' financial disclosure forms didn't help his case.)\n\nProPublica's latest report says that Thomas' mother has lived in a home Crow bought from Thomas in 2014 - and the justice never disclosed the transaction, which is possibly in violation of federal law. In addition, Crow reportedly added tens of thousands of dollars of improvements to the house in Savannah, Georgia.\n\nThomas now intends to amend his financial disclosure forms to acknowledge the real estate deal with Crow, CNN reported Monday, citing a source close to Thomas. Too little too late.\n\nSo, according to these recent reports, Thomas appears to have been leveraging his government job to get free stuff. And it seems very close to the kind of government dependency he has denounced in the past.\n\nIt's a stance Thomas has used to browbeat Black people throughout his career. Keep in mind, for example, what he said about his own sister before he was nominated to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn a 1980 speech to fellow Black conservatives, Thomas claimed that his sister \"gets mad when the mailman is late with her welfare check. That's how dependent she is.\"\n\nHe added: \"What's worse is that now her kids feel entitled to the check, too. They have no motivation for doing better or getting out of that situation.''\n\nBut a decade later, reporting found that Thomas hadn't been accurate in making his sister sound like a \"welfare queen,\" the racialized derogatory term for welfare recipients used by Ronald Reagan and other conservatives.\n\nAs the Chicago Tribune's Clarence Page wrote at the time :\n\nIt was a stunning story. To hear Thomas tell it, his sister sounded like a classic ''welfare queen'' of the sort presidential candidate Ronald Reagan singled out that same year, a painful example of how a well-intended government handout can tie families to a cycle of poverty and dependency.\n\nUnfortunately, Thomas' stunning story wasn't true. Not quite.\n\nWhen reporters recently tracked down Thomas' sister, Emma Mae Martin, living in a beat-up frame house with a hole in the roof in Pin Point, Ga., a few steps from where she and her two younger brothers were born, they didn't find a story of welfare dependency.\n\nInstead, they found a story of hard work by three generations of a family struggling like most other families do, just to make ends meet.\n\nOne wonders what Emma Mae Martin might think about what her brother said about her in light of the revelations that he has been plied with goodies - seemingly thanks to his cushy government job. Goodies that he claims he had no duty to report .\n\nHow's that for \"entitled\"?\n\nThen there's this whopper, from Thomas' own autobiography. Writing about his time as a student at Yale, Thomas railed against \"paternalistic\" whites:\n\nAt least southerners were up front about their bigotry: you knew exactly where they were coming from, just like the Georgia rattlesnakes that always let you know when they were ready to strike. Not so the paternalistic big-city whites who offered you a helping hand so long as you were careful to agree with them, but slapped you down if you started acting as if you didn't know your place.\n\nThat's very rich. And I'm talking \"Harlan Crow rich.\"\n\nClarence Thomas claims to be against government dependency and paternalism. Yet thanks to his government job, he apparently has received favors from a rich white man who even bought his mama a house. It truly doesn't get more paternalistic than that.\n\nAt long last, we've finally found a true welfare queen!\n\nIt's Clarence Thomas. And maybe his mom, too.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger. He previously wrote The ReidOut Blog. He is a futurist and multimedia producer focused on culture and politics.

You shouldn't trust him either.\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nIt's easy to understand why \" Hillbilly Elegy,\" the 2016 memoir by JD Vance , piqued the interest of the American people. It recycles a narrative America has relied on for a century to sleep soundly despite the everyday horrors of our society: Rich people do well because they are morally better than the poor.\n\nAdd some powerful tropes - a firebrand \"pistol packing lunatic\" mamaw who protects at all costs, a rags-to-riches story in which Vance, a Marine ,  escapes the \"worst of my cultural inheritance\" (p. 253) of unsophisticated, drug-addicted, murderous hillbillies - and you've got a bestseller.\n\nUnlike me, Vance is not Appalachian.  He was born and raised in Middletown, Ohio, well outside any maps of the distinct geographical and cultural region.\n\nYou've also got a dangerous lie, one relying on ugly stereotypes that harm real Appalachians in order to advance a political career. Former President Donald Trump announced Monday that Vance, the junior senator from Ohio, is his pick for his running mate .\n\nUnlike me, Vance is not Appalachian. He was born and raised in Middletown, Ohio , well outside any maps of the distinct geographical and cultural region. Trump picking this Rust Belt charlatan as his running mate Monday sparked a resounding and unifying rant among conservative and liberal hillbillies alike in my social media feed: We do not acknowledge him.\n\nWhy would we? Vance introduces his reader to Appalachia by immediately profiling the worst behaviors of each of his uncles, including a scene of grotesque violence. He calls us a \"pessimistic bunch\" living in a \"hub of misery\" (p. 4), and over and over again he uses a wide brush to paint Appalachians as lazy, ignorant and unwilling to try at life.\n\nThough there are dozens of offensive stories to choose from in \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" perhaps the most ridiculous one occurs when, during boot camp, Vance says he meets an eastern Kentuckian who, never having heard the term, asks \"What's a Catholic?\" because, as Vance presents it, \"down in that part of Kentucky [where he says that man is from], everybody's a snake handler.\" (p. 160). It's an addictively stereotypical image: the ignorant, isolated, snake-handling hillbilly. But it's not reality. There are a half dozen churches in that Kentuckian's county seat, mostly Baptist and Methodist.  Just 20 miles away, in Hazard, there's a Catholic Church. Another 20 miles away, where Vance's family lives, there's a Catholic Church with more than 4,000 Facebook followers.\n\nVance's memoir of Appalachia, full of gun-toting, drug-addicted \"lunatics\" aimlessly awaiting death, is at best a cherry-picking of the worst moments of his life. At worst, it's a concoction of real memories and some of television's worst stereotypes of what Appalachia is.\n\nI do not see my Appalachia in it.\n\nI am not alone.\n\nAnthony Harkins and Meredith McCarroll's \" Appalachian Reckoning, \" a response to Vance's bestseller, anthologizes more than 400 pages of responses from real Appalachians describing their lives in all the nuance they deserve.\n\nBut nuanced stories aren't useful in politics.\n\nAppalachia is simply a rhetorical device for Vance that he used to launch a political career. If your political goal is to blame the poor for their own problems, then using the regional ethnicity of your grandparents to present yourself as \"authentic\" can compel readers to believe your narrative or to feel good about having already believed it. After all, the narrative of the lazy hillbilly has existed for as long as rich folks outside of Appalachia needed an explanation for mountain poverty that doesn't include blaming themselves.\n\nThe narrative of the lazy hillbilly has existed for as long as rich folks outside of Appalachia needed an explanation for mountain poverty that doesn't include blaming themselves\n\nDid the poverty come from the rest of the country ignoring a region they thought had no resources?\n\nDid the poverty come from coal barons stealing resources once they were discovered?\n\nDid the poverty come from outside coal companies not paying coal miners actual money for decades?\n\nWhy blame complex issues that implicate rich white folks when \"lazy\" is only two syllables?\n\nVance builds on this narrative, ignoring nuance and context, presenting supposed anecdote after supposed anecdote of cultural depravity and portraying himself as a hillbilly who survived and knows the answer to what ails Appalachia is political conservatism.\n\nFor Vance, issues of poverty, drug abuse and neglected children are \"issues of family, faith, and culture.\" (p. 238) He goes so far as to claim that these \"problems were not created by governments or corporations or anyone else.\" (p. 255)\n\nThat's insulting. Individuals living in poverty did not invent opioids . Individuals living in poverty did not refuse to regulate opioids.\n\nHe puts the blame entirely on poor Americans, on mothers on food stamps and on fathers who are out of work, extending the roots of that blame directly to Appalachians and some inherent moral flaw. In convincing readers outside of Appalachia that they need the solution he is selling, he paints the Appalachian as the moral problem in America:\n\nThe dog whistle is pretty clear: The immoral hill folks are already in your area. Trust me, I escaped them. I know the answer to save you from them.\n\n\"If there is any temptation to judge these problems as the narrow concerns of backwoods hollers, a glimpse at my own life reveals that Jackson [Kentucky]'s plight has gone mainstream. Thanks to the massive migration from the poorer regions of Appalachia to places like Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, hillbilly values spread widely along with hillbilly people.\" (p. 20)\n\nThe dog whistle is pretty clear: The immoral hill folks are already in your area. Trust me, I escaped them. I know the answer to save you from them.\n\nThe \"hillbilly\" twist is a particularly clever political move because it allows poor white folks living in swing states (like those listed above) to draw a quick line of demarcation around themselves - hardworking but poor Americans - and the supposed immoral, lazy welfare queens and absent, violent hillbilly fathers spreading into their cities and towns.\n\nVance paints himself as having narrowly escaped  \"the deep anger and resentment\" (p. 2) of those who raised him and laments the supposed white working class feeling that \"our choices don't matter.\" (p. 176)\n\nWednesday morning, my sister, who has known overwhelming pain and difficulty, signed up for nursing classes at a community college. Last week, my nephew, a young man with everything stacked against him, asked me to meet him to talk about vocational school.\n\nI see people making choices.\n\nI see no anger.\n\nVance confuses frustration in a difficult system with anger and resentment.\n\nVance confuses frustration in a difficult system with anger and resentment; he misrepresents  Appalachians acknowledging that the choices they have are few and far between and require great levels of personal sacrifice as their belief that the choices they make don't matter. He sees the drowning person and decides they lack determination in swimming. He ignores those creating the flood.\n\nVance does identify one hillbilly trait that I will, at this moment, agree with: We can be distrustful of outsiders. I might add that I am most distrustful of outsiders pretending to be insiders and of outsiders with a political agenda.\n\nThis hillbilly does not trust JD Vance.\n\nWillie Carver is a gay hillbilly writer and poet from Eastern Kentucky.

We want to hear your story. Email us at CheckbookChronicles@nbcuni.com\n\nDoug Sharp isn't a rich man - but he has played one in Hollywood.\n\nSharp, 59, lives in Los Angeles and until recently got the bulk of his income by driving for Uber and Lyft while moonlighting as a paid extra.\n\nIt's the chance to earn the spotlight and work with others who share his passion for acting that keeps him going after years of having failed to find any other kind of full-time work.\n\nPrimary source of income: Sharp says he struggles to make ends meet, having survived the past few years on a generous pandemic unemployment reimbursement.\n\nHe has begun taking delivery orders on UberEats, but he said the pay barely makes it worth it.\n\nWhat keeps Sharp going is acting - a notoriously fickle endeavor but one he says has upside potential. He recently got a small speaking part in a coming production featuring at least two Hollywood A-listers - and saw his daily pay rate go from about $200 to nearly $1,200.\n\n\"The money for background is good, and there's always the possibility of being upgraded to principal,\" he said. \"That has happened to me - I have not found a replacement for it.\"\n\nStill, it's not consistent enough for him to obtain full Screen Actors Guild benefits, so his health insurance is through Medicaid.\n\nLiving situation: Sharp lives alone and said his housing situation is unstable. It includes periodically renting from a friend, as well as an unauthorized arrangement he wasn't comfortable discussing on the record.\n\nEconomic outlook: After nearly a decade of making steady pay driving for Uber and Lyft, Sharp has effectively quit both platforms for now, in part, he said, because their base pay and regular rates are no longer enough make it worth it to use them, especially for what's needed to live in Los Angeles.\n\nActing remains enjoyable - Sharp said he isn't a celebrity hound and simply enjoys being around other people.\n\n\"The older you get, the less parts there are,\" he said. \"However, the pool of older guys is smaller - and shockingly I always play the rich white guy, because that's what I look like. But I didn't I know look like a rich white guy until I started playing one.\"\n\nYet the gigs have hardly been steady enough to make a career out of.\n\n\"What I can tell you is I barely work,\" Sharp said. \"In May I worked two days, in April I worked four days, in March I worked two days, in February I worked two days, in January I worked one day.\"\n\nBudget pain points: Sharp struggles buying basic necessities, to the point that he found himself recently trying to return goods around his residence to Home Depot and Walmart for cash or credit.\n\nHe owns a car, a Fiat 500, but is trying to obtain a new one through a rental company so he can get back to driving for Uber and Lyft - even at the reduced rates. However, he's not sure his credit score will be good enough for him to obtain the new vehicle.\n\nOutlook: Sharp said he basically started his life over in his 40s, when he got a business degree from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. But he graduated in 2013, when the economy was still emerging from the global financial crisis, and he couldn't land a job.\n\nUber, and later Lyft, provided a lifeline, and he enjoyed the work. But over the years, their rates got lower and lower.\n\nStill, returning to those platforms remains his key financial objective.\n\nIn the meantime, Sharp struggles with depression and anxiety.\n\n\"The one thing people hate are educated white men who look rich but who are poor,\" Sharp said. \"They think, 'Oh, he must be lazy or on drugs. What is his problem?' I get this - I've watched my friend group move away.\"\n\n\"I am ashamed about where I am in my life as it relates to my finances and not knowing how to fix it,\" he continued.\n\nFinding a full-time job - even at a fast-food restaurant, and even in a labor market that the Federal Reserve says remains relatively healthy - has been a lot more difficult than one might imagine.\n\n\"I do qualify for food stamps; I do qualify for [Medicaid],\" he said. \"I'm not embarrassed about that, but when I'm willing to work - and bust my ass - why is it that I can't get a living wage?\"\n\nIronically, fast-food jobs are now quite difficult to obtain, Sharp said, not least because their hourly wages are higher than in many other industries thanks to California's new $20 minimum wage for workers in the sector.\n\n\"It's embarrassing, because it seems like there's a piece of the puzzle that I'm not telling,\" Sharp said. \"I'm doing everything I can.\"\n\nI am a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com, with a focus on writing for everyday consumers and ensuring online coverage of major business events. Day to day, I am responsible for writing about inflation reports, recalls, corporate announcements and consumer-focused government announcements, including regulations and enforcements. I also write features and explainers on a wide array of topics - everything from Disney's conflict with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to the recent settlement with the National Association of Realtors that will change how homebuyers pay brokers, to the business of the WNBA.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

I'm on the short list of live resources because I began covering him when he was Cassius Clay and I was starting out as a New York Times sports reporter. Other than, I guess, Abraham Lincoln or Jesus Christ, the current go-to-guy for a quick symbolic fix of history, spirituality, and spectacle is that heavyweight boxer who called himself The Greatest. Somehow, he's now right up there with two other once super-polarizing figures-the greatest American president and the greatest Christian of all time. I've been wondering lately just how Ali actually reached such heights. There are plenty of people alive today who once hated him and yet, in American popular culture, he's now a secular saint. He would only have been 80 years old on January 17. He died in 2016 at 74. While Lincoln and Christ were dramatically killed in their prime, Ali's life began fading away before our eyes while he was still in his 30s. That was when he gradually began losing his voice (and oh, what a voice it was!), his mobility, and his expressive affect, first from the pummeling that boxing gave him and then from Parkinson's disease. I rarely refuse interview requests about him. As one of a diminishing group of old, mostly white male journalists who knew Clay before he was champion, I feel an obligation to help set straight a willfully misinterpreted biography. I'm also always curious about why strangers are so fascinated by Ali and who they think he really was. In recent years, they've ranged from the documentary king Ken Burns to an eighth-grader from California named Harmony. Like most of the scores of others, their questions were remarkably sharp and well-prepared, although most of them lean toward the Ali industry's common image of him as a fiery social warrior who arrived fully formed at a time in need of just such a hero. That image is easier than dealing with his early espousal of a separatist cult preaching that white people were devils genetically created by an evil scientist. On Allah's chosen day of retribution, went the dogma of the Nation of Islam cult to which he then belonged, the Mother of Planes would bomb all but the righteous, who were to be spirited away. It was also easier than remembering Ali's repudiation of his early mentor, Malcolm X. Ali chose the Nation's leader, Elijah Muhammad, over him, a betrayal that may have doomed Malcolm to assassination.

While he still gave the Nation of Islam credit for offering him a black-is-beautiful message at a time of low self-esteem and persecution, he also said definitively that \"color doesn't make a man a devil. It's the heart and soul and mind that count. What's on the outside is only decoration.\" And he admitted that he had made a mistake in turning his back on Malcolm, partly in fear for his own life. The Operatic Life I've always thought that Ali's journey from youthful ignorance to a hard-earned enlightenment was one of the most inspiring stories in the history of sports, perhaps even a kind of morality play or, at the least, an opera. And so, I was hardly surprised last month, on the same day I answered an Austrian journalist's e-mailed Ali questions, to learn that, thanks to Covid-19, Opera Las Vegas had indeed postponed the opening of a new opera, Approaching Ali . Meanwhile, the Ali Center in Louisville was sponsoring a star-studded virtual event celebrating what would have been his 80th birthday. And the Smithsonian Channel announced a new two-hour documentary, Cassius X: Becoming Ali , about the five-year \"spiritual and ideological journey\" in which, from 1959 to 1964, that callow young boxer was transformed into a world champion. (And, yes, I'm a talking head in it, along with Burns's eight-hour epic and too many others.) All of this leaves us with the question of how Ali-or at least a version of Ali-became the Last American Hero. The American dream may be coming apart at the seams, but the glory of The Greatest is in full flower and still growing. Why? The simplest answer-and the most discouraging-may be the right one. There is no one else. In the age of Trump, the Hero Pool has dried up, if at least you ignore the endless movie characters based on comic book super people (or creatures). Even my own childhood fave, Superman, who early in his career battled the Nazis, has lost his dominance. In America, the terrible tribalization of the Trump era has made it almost impossible to consider any kind of consensus hero worship in any genre (Dr. King, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Who?) while culture was becoming as politicized as politics. The usual default for hero worship, sports, has turned into an all-star disaster area and perhaps a leading reason for the idol abyss of the present moment. A Roster of Hyped (and Then Discredited) Heroes Lately, almost every sport has contributed a major disappointment in the form of a hyped hero who came up all too short. Recently and typically, the popular golfer Phil Mickelson was one of a group of PGA pros who signed up for a lucrative tournament in Saudi Arabia (with its murderous regime) at about the same time the number-one tennis player, Novak Djokovic, was trying unsuccessfully to stay and play in Australia while unvaxxed. As we inched toward the February 13th Super Bowl, many began rooting not for but against fan darling Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers who turned out to be another unvaxxed slickster. When the Pittsburgh Steelers were eliminated from the playoffs, their long-time superstar quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was relieved of a full-scale moral review, but he won't be able to avoid it when he becomes a candidate for the Hall of Fame. Among the sportswriters who vote for the future immortals, baseball has similarly had a long-simmering argument over the moral qualifications for its Hall of Fame candidates. And that, as it happens, offers a controversy all its own. Since induction brings a substantial boost in sideshow income, isn't it a conflict of interest for so-called journalists to reward their subjects that way? In any case, the argument over qualifications seems to have boiled down to skirmishes between the Moralists, who can't abide the likes of Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Alex Rodriguez, or Curt Schilling, all of whom have been accused of using performance enhancing drugs, and the Analytics, who believe that only statistics should be the basis for such final judgments. (Allegations of drug use or bad behavior be damned.) Such arguments have devalued the very idea of a Hall of Fame because the statistically minded sportswriters come across as mindless boosters hiding behind numbers, while the Moralists seem like all-too-tiresome finger-pointers. How do you get heroes out of that? The answer is: You don't. So you go back to Ali, who was stripped of his heavyweight title in 1967 after refusing to be drafted into the Vietnam-era Army for religious reasons. It's always worth recalling that he was not penalized by some federal agency or central governing sports body, but rather by scores of politically appointed local boxing commissions. Hero and Villain Ali immediately became both hero and villain, celebrated for a principled stand against the Vietnam War (\"Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam after so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?... I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong\"), vilified for rejecting his country's call of duty, and sentenced to five years in jail for refusing induction, later overturned by the Supreme Court. The passion of those 55-year-old reactions to Ali's draft avoidance were echoed in 2016, several weeks after his death when, in one of sports' most symbolic acts, Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem before a pro football game and instead took a knee. As that season unfolded and Kaepernick became a right-wing target, it seemed as though the San Francisco 49ers' quarterback would prove a worthy successor to Ali as an all-American hero in chief. He, too, was clearly taking a personally dangerous and politically principled stand and his avowed purpose-to call attention to discrimination against people of color-seemed unassailable. But even as Ali remained a secular saint, Kaepernick would be maligned and smoothly sideswiped. He really wasn't such a good quarterback, it was said (although he had led his team to the Super Bowl), and anyway he was nothing but a pawn of the Black Lives Matter movement. Most damaging for Kaepernick, I think, was the lack of white support, especially among other National Football League players. (Black support wasn't so widespread, either.) Ali, of course, never lost the favor of the millions of young white fans against the draft. Ali's hero status remains unsullied, especially because it's been sanitized. The fearsome social warrior of 1967 came, in the end, to be celebrated as something of a teddy bear. Ringing the Wrong Bell The issue of neutering a feared social warrior has been covered most trenchantly by Thomas Hauser, the lawyer and novelist who is Ali's most exhaustive and reliable chronicler. His description of Ali as \"a beacon of hope for oppressed people all over the world\" as well as \"the embodiment of love\" whose \"dreams inspired the world,\" has clearly led to his antipathy toward what he sees as the relentless commercialization of Ali. No example of this was more symbolic than his appearance at the New York Stock Exchange on December 31, 1999. Hauser says he thought Ali should have celebrated that millennial moment \"at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter to draw attention to the plight of the disadvantaged.\" Ali, according to Hauser, was, however, adept at avoiding making rich white people feel guilty or even uncomfortable. The cruelest Ali had ever been publicly was to his most formidable opponent, Joe Frazier, a Black man-calling him a \"gorilla,\" while mocking his nose, lips, and skin. \"In real life,\" writes Hauser, \"Ali played the race card against Frazier in a particularly mean-spirited way. For the entertainment of white America, he labeled Joe as ugly and dumb. And at the same time, speaking to Black America, he branded Frazier an Uncle Tom, turning him into an object of derision and scorn within the Black community.\" One of the harshest observers of Ali's commodification, Mike Marqusee, author of Redemption Song: Muhammad Ali and the Spirit of the Sixties , broadened such a critique by writing: Ali's power in the third world grew precisely because he was a symbol of defiance against racism and the use of United States military power abroad. And those issues are very much alive today; so, it means a lot to the powers that be if Ali can be used to suggest to the rest of the world that they aren't problems anymore. [Ali's] history is now being plundered and deliberately obscured to sell commercial products and, more significantly, ideas. No wonder I looked for hope in Harmony. After the Zoom interview and some follow-up e-mails, I asked the California eighth grader if she and her project colleagues would answer two short questions: Based on your research, what do you think Ali should be remembered for now? Is that the same thing you might have thought before you did your research? Generously, Harmony offered the views of her classmate, Yaseen, who wrote that he thinks \"Ali should be remembered for being arguably the most iconic athlete of all time and as a hero because he taught young Black people that they could do anything and he should also be remembered for the positivity and love he spread in his life.\" Before researching his life, he had merely thought that Ali \"was a good boxer.\" That was positive. And then, the day that Yaseen's tribute arrived, part of a weekend that would include my birthday, as well as Ali's and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s , a request arrived from a Purdue University graduate student for information about Superman's role in American culture. Many years ago, I had been involved in a TV show that peripherally addressed that subject. Of course, I agreed to answer his questions and started plowing through old notes where I found a reference to a 1978 DC comic book called \"Superman vs. Muhammad Ali\" in which the two team up to defeat an alien invasion of America. My heart raced at that. Alien invasion? We're in the middle of one right now. They're called greedy, gutless Republicans and they seem to be winning. And worse yet, they have a hero whose seedy charisma and shamelessness is enough to inflame his nervous and needy followers. Spoiler alert: in the comic, the good guys win and Ali shouts, \"Superman, WE are the greatest!\" And it's true. Unlike Trump , the champ was willing to share the glory. What more can we expect from a \"hero\" these days?\n\nOther than, I guess, Abraham Lincoln or Jesus Christ, the current go-to-guy for a quick symbolic fix of history, spirituality, and spectacle is that heavyweight boxer who called himself The Greatest. Somehow, he's now right up there with two other once super-polarizing figures-the greatest American president and the greatest Christian of all time.

On Allah's chosen day of retribution, went the dogma of the Nation of Islam cult to which he then belonged, the Mother of Planes would bomb all but the righteous, who were to be spirited away. It was also easier than remembering Ali's repudiation of his early mentor, Malcolm X. Ali chose the Nation's leader, Elijah Muhammad, over him, a betrayal that may have doomed Malcolm to assassination.

While he still gave the Nation of Islam credit for offering him a black-is-beautiful message at a time of low self-esteem and persecution, he also said definitively that \"color doesn't make a man a devil. It's the heart and soul and mind that count. What's on the outside is only decoration.\" And he admitted that he had made a mistake in turning his back on Malcolm, partly in fear for his own life. The Operatic Life I've always thought that Ali's journey from youthful ignorance to a hard-earned enlightenment was one of the most inspiring stories in the history of sports, perhaps even a kind of morality play or, at the least, an opera. And so, I was hardly surprised last month, on the same day I answered an Austrian journalist's e-mailed Ali questions, to learn that, thanks to Covid-19, Opera Las Vegas had indeed postponed the opening of a new opera, Approaching Ali . Meanwhile, the Ali Center in Louisville was sponsoring a star-studded virtual event celebrating what would have been his 80th birthday. And the Smithsonian Channel announced a new two-hour documentary, Cassius X: Becoming Ali , about the five-year \"spiritual and ideological journey\" in which, from 1959 to 1964, that callow young boxer was transformed into a world champion. (And, yes, I'm a talking head in it, along with Burns's eight-hour epic and too many others.) All of this leaves us with the question of how Ali-or at least a version of Ali-became the Last American Hero. The American dream may be coming apart at the seams, but the glory of The Greatest is in full flower and still growing. Why? The simplest answer-and the most discouraging-may be the right one. There is no one else. In the age of Trump, the Hero Pool has dried up, if at least you ignore the endless movie characters based on comic book super people (or creatures). Even my own childhood fave, Superman, who early in his career battled the Nazis, has lost his dominance. In America, the terrible tribalization of the Trump era has made it almost impossible to consider any kind of consensus hero worship in any genre (Dr. King, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Who?) while culture was becoming as politicized as politics. The usual default for hero worship, sports, has turned into an all-star disaster area and perhaps a leading reason for the idol abyss of the present moment. A Roster of Hyped (and Then Discredited) Heroes Lately, almost every sport has contributed a major disappointment in the form of a hyped hero who came up all too short. Recently and typically, the popular golfer Phil Mickelson was one of a group of PGA pros who signed up for a lucrative tournament in Saudi Arabia (with its murderous regime) at about the same time the number-one tennis player, Novak Djokovic, was trying unsuccessfully to stay and play in Australia while unvaxxed. As we inched toward the February 13th Super Bowl, many began rooting not for but against fan darling Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers who turned out to be another unvaxxed slickster. When the Pittsburgh Steelers were eliminated from the playoffs, their long-time superstar quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was relieved of a full-scale moral review, but he won't be able to avoid it when he becomes a candidate for the Hall of Fame. Among the sportswriters who vote for the future immortals, baseball has similarly had a long-simmering argument over the moral qualifications for its Hall of Fame candidates. And that, as it happens, offers a controversy all its own. Since induction brings a substantial boost in sideshow income, isn't it a conflict of interest for so-called journalists to reward their subjects that way? In any case, the argument over qualifications seems to have boiled down to skirmishes between the Moralists, who can't abide the likes of Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Alex Rodriguez, or Curt Schilling, all of whom have been accused of using performance enhancing drugs, and the Analytics, who believe that only statistics should be the basis for such final judgments. (Allegations of drug use or bad behavior be damned.) Such arguments have devalued the very idea of a Hall of Fame because the statistically minded sportswriters come across as mindless boosters hiding behind numbers, while the Moralists seem like all-too-tiresome finger-pointers. How do you get heroes out of that? The answer is: You don't. So you go back to Ali, who was stripped of his heavyweight title in 1967 after refusing to be drafted into the Vietnam-era Army for religious reasons. It's always worth recalling that he was not penalized by some federal agency or central governing sports body, but rather by scores of politically appointed local boxing commissions. Hero and Villain Ali immediately became both hero and villain, celebrated for a principled stand against the Vietnam War (\"Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam after so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?... I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong\"), vilified for rejecting his country's call of duty, and sentenced to five years in jail for refusing induction, later overturned by the Supreme Court. The passion of those 55-year-old reactions to Ali's draft avoidance were echoed in 2016, several weeks after his death when, in one of sports' most symbolic acts, Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem before a pro football game and instead took a knee. As that season unfolded and Kaepernick became a right-wing target, it seemed as though the San Francisco 49ers' quarterback would prove a worthy successor to Ali as an all-American hero in chief. He, too, was clearly taking a personally dangerous and politically principled stand and his avowed purpose-to call attention to discrimination against people of color-seemed unassailable. But even as Ali remained a secular saint, Kaepernick would be maligned and smoothly sideswiped. He really wasn't such a good quarterback, it was said (although he had led his team to the Super Bowl), and anyway he was nothing but a pawn of the Black Lives Matter movement. Most damaging for Kaepernick, I think, was the lack of white support, especially among other National Football League players. (Black support wasn't so widespread, either.) Ali, of course, never lost the favor of the millions of young white fans against the draft. Ali's hero status remains unsullied, especially because it's been sanitized. The fearsome social warrior of 1967 came, in the end, to be celebrated as something of a teddy bear. Ringing the Wrong Bell The issue of neutering a feared social warrior has been covered most trenchantly by Thomas Hauser, the lawyer and novelist who is Ali's most exhaustive and reliable chronicler. His description of Ali as \"a beacon of hope for oppressed people all over the world\" as well as \"the embodiment of love\" whose \"dreams inspired the world,\" has clearly led to his antipathy toward what he sees as the relentless commercialization of Ali. No example of this was more symbolic than his appearance at the New York Stock Exchange on December 31, 1999. Hauser says he thought Ali should have celebrated that millennial moment \"at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter to draw attention to the plight of the disadvantaged.\" Ali, according to Hauser, was, however, adept at avoiding making rich white people feel guilty or even uncomfortable. The cruelest Ali had ever been publicly was to his most formidable opponent, Joe Frazier, a Black man-calling him a \"gorilla,\" while mocking his nose, lips, and skin. \"In real life,\" writes Hauser, \"Ali played the race card against Frazier in a particularly mean-spirited way. For the entertainment of white America, he labeled Joe as ugly and dumb. And at the same time, speaking to Black America, he branded Frazier an Uncle Tom, turning him into an object of derision and scorn within the Black community.\" One of the harshest observers of Ali's commodification, Mike Marqusee, author of Redemption Song: Muhammad Ali and the Spirit of the Sixties , broadened such a critique by writing: Ali's power in the third world grew precisely because he was a symbol of defiance against racism and the use of United States military power abroad. And those issues are very much alive today; so, it means a lot to the powers that be if Ali can be used to suggest to the rest of the world that they aren't problems anymore. [Ali's] history is now being plundered and deliberately obscured to sell commercial products and, more significantly, ideas. No wonder I looked for hope in Harmony. After the Zoom interview and some follow-up e-mails, I asked the California eighth grader if she and her project colleagues would answer two short questions: Based on your research, what do you think Ali should be remembered for now? Is that the same thing you might have thought before you did your research? Generously, Harmony offered the views of her classmate, Yaseen, who wrote that he thinks \"Ali should be remembered for being arguably the most iconic athlete of all time and as a hero because he taught young Black people that they could do anything and he should also be remembered for the positivity and love he spread in his life.\" Before researching his life, he had merely thought that Ali \"was a good boxer.\" That was positive. And then, the day that Yaseen's tribute arrived, part of a weekend that would include my birthday, as well as Ali's and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s , a request arrived from a Purdue University graduate student for information about Superman's role in American culture. Many years ago, I had been involved in a TV show that peripherally addressed that subject. Of course, I agreed to answer his questions and started plowing through old notes where I found a reference to a 1978 DC comic book called \"Superman vs. Muhammad Ali\" in which the two team up to defeat an alien invasion of America. My heart raced at that. Alien invasion? We're in the middle of one right now. They're called greedy, gutless Republicans and they seem to be winning. And worse yet, they have a hero whose seedy charisma and shamelessness is enough to inflame his nervous and needy followers. Spoiler alert: in the comic, the good guys win and Ali shouts, \"Superman, WE are the greatest!\" And it's true. Unlike Trump , the champ was willing to share the glory. What more can we expect from a \"hero\" these days?\n\nHe would only have been 80 years old on January 17. He died in 2016 at 74. While Lincoln and Christ were dramatically killed in their prime, Ali's life began fading away before our eyes while he was still in his 30s. That was when he gradually began losing his voice (and oh, what a voice it was!), his mobility, and his expressive affect, first from the pummeling that boxing gave him and then from Parkinson's disease. I rarely refuse interview requests about him. As one of a diminishing group of old, mostly white male journalists who knew Clay before he was champion, I feel an obligation to help set straight a willfully misinterpreted biography. I'm also always curious about why strangers are so fascinated by Ali and who they think he really was. In recent years, they've ranged from the documentary king Ken Burns to an eighth-grader from California named Harmony. Like most of the scores of others, their questions were remarkably sharp and well-prepared, although most of them lean toward the Ali industry's common image of him as a fiery social warrior who arrived fully formed at a time in need of just such a hero. That image is easier than dealing with his early espousal of a separatist cult preaching that white people were devils genetically created by an evil scientist. On Allah's chosen day of retribution, went the dogma of the Nation of Islam cult to which he then belonged, the Mother of Planes would bomb all but the righteous, who were to be spirited away. It was also easier than remembering Ali's repudiation of his early mentor, Malcolm X.

And at the same time, speaking to Black America, he branded Frazier an Uncle Tom, turning him into an object of derision and scorn within the Black community.\" One of the harshest observers of Ali's commodification, Mike Marqusee, author of Redemption Song: Muhammad Ali and the Spirit of the Sixties , broadened such a critique by writing: Ali's power in the third world grew precisely because he was a symbol of defiance against racism and the use of United States military power abroad. And those issues are very much alive today; so, it means a lot to the powers that be if Ali can be used to suggest to the rest of the world that they aren't problems anymore. [Ali's] history is now being plundered and deliberately obscured to sell commercial products and, more significantly, ideas. No wonder I looked for hope in Harmony. After the Zoom interview and some follow-up e-mails, I asked the California eighth grader if she and her project colleagues would answer two short questions: Based on your research, what do you think Ali should be remembered for now? Is that the same thing you might have thought before you did your research? Generously, Harmony offered the views of her classmate, Yaseen, who wrote that he thinks \"Ali should be remembered for being arguably the most iconic athlete of all time and as a hero because he taught young Black people that they could do anything and he should also be remembered for the positivity and love he spread in his life.\" Before researching his life, he had merely thought that Ali \"was a good boxer.\" That was positive. And then, the day that Yaseen's tribute arrived, part of a weekend that would include my birthday, as well as Ali's and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s , a request arrived from a Purdue University graduate student for information about Superman's role in American culture. Many years ago, I had been involved in a TV show that peripherally addressed that subject. Of course, I agreed to answer his questions and started plowing through old notes where I found a reference to a 1978 DC comic book called \"Superman vs. Muhammad Ali\" in which the two team up to defeat an alien invasion of America. My heart raced at that. Alien invasion? We're in the middle of one right now. They're called greedy, gutless Republicans and they seem to be winning. And worse yet, they have a hero whose seedy charisma and shamelessness is enough to inflame his nervous and needy followers. Spoiler alert: in the comic, the good guys win and Ali shouts, \"Superman, WE are the greatest!\" And it's true. Unlike Trump , the champ was willing to share the glory. What more can we expect from a \"hero\" these days?\n\nIn recent years, they've ranged from the documentary king Ken Burns to an eighth-grader from California named Harmony. Like most of the scores of others, their questions were remarkably sharp and well-prepared, although most of them lean toward the Ali industry's common image of him as a fiery social warrior who arrived fully formed at a time in need of just such a hero. That image is easier than dealing with his early espousal of a separatist cult preaching that white people were devils genetically created by an evil scientist. On Allah's chosen day of retribution, went the dogma of the Nation of Islam cult to which he then belonged, the Mother of Planes would bomb all but the righteous, who were to be spirited away. It was also easier than remembering Ali's repudiation of his early mentor, Malcolm X. Ali chose the Nation's leader, Elijah Muhammad, over him, a betrayal that may have doomed Malcolm to assassination.

While he still gave the Nation of Islam credit for offering him a black-is-beautiful message at a time of low self-esteem and persecution, he also said definitively that \"color doesn't make a man a devil. It's the heart and soul and mind that count. What's on the outside is only decoration.\" And he admitted that he had made a mistake in turning his back on Malcolm, partly in fear for his own life. The Operatic Life I've always thought that Ali's journey from youthful ignorance to a hard-earned enlightenment was one of the most inspiring stories in the history of sports, perhaps even a kind of morality play or, at the least, an opera. And so, I was hardly surprised last month, on the same day I answered an Austrian journalist's e-mailed Ali questions, to learn that, thanks to Covid-19, Opera Las Vegas had indeed postponed the opening of a new opera, Approaching Ali . Meanwhile, the Ali Center in Louisville was sponsoring a star-studded virtual event celebrating what would have been his 80th birthday. And the Smithsonian Channel announced a new two-hour documentary, Cassius X: Becoming Ali , about the five-year \"spiritual and ideological journey\" in which, from 1959 to 1964, that callow young boxer was transformed into a world champion. (And, yes, I'm a talking head in it, along with Burns's eight-hour epic and too many others.) All of this leaves us with the question of how Ali-or at least a version of Ali-became the Last American Hero. The American dream may be coming apart at the seams, but the glory of The Greatest is in full flower and still growing. Why? The simplest answer-and the most discouraging-may be the right one. There is no one else. In the age of Trump, the Hero Pool has dried up, if at least you ignore the endless movie characters based on comic book super people (or creatures). Even my own childhood fave, Superman, who early in his career battled the Nazis, has lost his dominance. In America, the terrible tribalization of the Trump era has made it almost impossible to consider any kind of consensus hero worship in any genre (Dr. King, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Who?) while culture was becoming as politicized as politics. The usual default for hero worship, sports, has turned into an all-star disaster area and perhaps a leading reason for the idol abyss of the present moment. A Roster of Hyped (and Then Discredited) Heroes Lately, almost every sport has contributed a major disappointment in the form of a hyped hero who came up all too short. Recently and typically, the popular golfer Phil Mickelson was one of a group of PGA pros who signed up for a lucrative tournament in Saudi Arabia (with its murderous regime) at about the same time the number-one tennis player, Novak Djokovic, was trying unsuccessfully to stay and play in Australia while unvaxxed. As we inched toward the February 13th Super Bowl, many began rooting not for but against fan darling Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers who turned out to be another unvaxxed slickster. When the Pittsburgh Steelers were eliminated from the playoffs, their long-time superstar quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was relieved of a full-scale moral review, but he won't be able to avoid it when he becomes a candidate for the Hall of Fame. Among the sportswriters who vote for the future immortals, baseball has similarly had a long-simmering argument over the moral qualifications for its Hall of Fame candidates. And that, as it happens, offers a controversy all its own. Since induction brings a substantial boost in sideshow income, isn't it a conflict of interest for so-called journalists to reward their subjects that way? In any case, the argument over qualifications seems to have boiled down to skirmishes between the Moralists, who can't abide the likes of Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Alex Rodriguez, or Curt Schilling, all of whom have been accused of using performance enhancing drugs, and the Analytics, who believe that only statistics should be the basis for such final judgments. (Allegations of drug use or bad behavior be damned.) Such arguments have devalued the very idea of a Hall of Fame because the statistically minded sportswriters come across as mindless boosters hiding behind numbers, while the Moralists seem like all-too-tiresome finger-pointers. How do you get heroes out of that? The answer is: You don't. So you go back to Ali, who was stripped of his heavyweight title in 1967 after refusing to be drafted into the Vietnam-era Army for religious reasons. It's always worth recalling that he was not penalized by some federal agency or central governing sports body, but rather by scores of politically appointed local boxing commissions. Hero and Villain Ali immediately became both hero and villain, celebrated for a principled stand against the Vietnam War (\"Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam after so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?... I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong\"), vilified for rejecting his country's call of duty, and sentenced to five years in jail for refusing induction, later overturned by the Supreme Court. The passion of those 55-year-old reactions to Ali's draft avoidance were echoed in 2016, several weeks after his death when, in one of sports' most symbolic acts, Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem before a pro football game and instead took a knee. As that season unfolded and Kaepernick became a right-wing target, it seemed as though the San Francisco 49ers' quarterback would prove a worthy successor to Ali as an all-American hero in chief. He, too, was clearly taking a personally dangerous and politically principled stand and his avowed purpose-to call attention to discrimination against people of color-seemed unassailable. But even as Ali remained a secular saint, Kaepernick would be maligned and smoothly sideswiped. He really wasn't such a good quarterback, it was said (although he had led his team to the Super Bowl), and anyway he was nothing but a pawn of the Black Lives Matter movement. Most damaging for Kaepernick, I think, was the lack of white support, especially among other National Football League players. (Black support wasn't so widespread, either.) Ali, of course, never lost the favor of the millions of young white fans against the draft. Ali's hero status remains unsullied, especially because it's been sanitized. The fearsome social warrior of 1967 came, in the end, to be celebrated as something of a teddy bear. Ringing the Wrong Bell The issue of neutering a feared social warrior has been covered most trenchantly by Thomas Hauser, the lawyer and novelist who is Ali's most exhaustive and reliable chronicler. His description of Ali as \"a beacon of hope for oppressed people all over the world\" as well as \"the embodiment of love\" whose \"dreams inspired the world,\" has clearly led to his antipathy toward what he sees as the relentless commercialization of Ali. No example of this was more symbolic than his appearance at the New York Stock Exchange on December 31, 1999. Hauser says he thought Ali should have celebrated that millennial moment \"at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter to draw attention to the plight of the disadvantaged.\" Ali, according to Hauser, was, however, adept at avoiding making rich white people feel guilty or even uncomfortable. The cruelest Ali had ever been publicly was to his most formidable opponent, Joe Frazier, a Black man-calling him a \"gorilla,\" while mocking his nose, lips, and skin. \"In real life,\" writes Hauser, \"Ali played the race card against Frazier in a particularly mean-spirited way.

And at the same time, speaking to Black America, he branded Frazier an Uncle Tom, turning him into an object of derision and scorn within the Black community.\" One of the harshest observers of Ali's commodification, Mike Marqusee, author of Redemption Song: Muhammad Ali and the Spirit of the Sixties , broadened such a critique by writing: Ali's power in the third world grew precisely because he was a symbol of defiance against racism and the use of United States military power abroad. And those issues are very much alive today; so, it means a lot to the powers that be if Ali can be used to suggest to the rest of the world that they aren't problems anymore. [Ali's] history is now being plundered and deliberately obscured to sell commercial products and, more significantly, ideas. No wonder I looked for hope in Harmony. After the Zoom interview and some follow-up e-mails, I asked the California eighth grader if she and her project colleagues would answer two short questions: Based on your research, what do you think Ali should be remembered for now? Is that the same thing you might have thought before you did your research? Generously, Harmony offered the views of her classmate, Yaseen, who wrote that he thinks \"Ali should be remembered for being arguably the most iconic athlete of all time and as a hero because he taught young Black people that they could do anything and he should also be remembered for the positivity and love he spread in his life.\" Before researching his life, he had merely thought that Ali \"was a good boxer.\" That was positive. And then, the day that Yaseen's tribute arrived, part of a weekend that would include my birthday, as well as Ali's and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s , a request arrived from a Purdue University graduate student for information about Superman's role in American culture. Many years ago, I had been involved in a TV show that peripherally addressed that subject. Of course, I agreed to answer his questions and started plowing through old notes where I found a reference to a 1978 DC comic book called \"Superman vs. Muhammad Ali\" in which the two team up to defeat an alien invasion of America. My heart raced at that. Alien invasion? We're in the middle of one right now. They're called greedy, gutless Republicans and they seem to be winning. And worse yet, they have a hero whose seedy charisma and shamelessness is enough to inflame his nervous and needy followers. Spoiler alert: in the comic, the good guys win and Ali shouts, \"Superman, WE are the greatest!\" And it's true. Unlike Trump , the champ was willing to share the glory. What more can we expect from a \"hero\" these days?\n\nAnd he admitted that he had made a mistake in turning his back on Malcolm, partly in fear for his own life. The Operatic Life I've always thought that Ali's journey from youthful ignorance to a hard-earned enlightenment was one of the most inspiring stories in the history of sports, perhaps even a kind of morality play or, at the least, an opera. And so, I was hardly surprised last month, on the same day I answered an Austrian journalist's e-mailed Ali questions, to learn that, thanks to Covid-19, Opera Las Vegas had indeed postponed the opening of a new opera, Approaching Ali . Meanwhile, the Ali Center in Louisville was sponsoring a star-studded virtual event celebrating what would have been his 80th birthday. And the Smithsonian Channel announced a new two-hour documentary, Cassius X: Becoming Ali , about the five-year \"spiritual and ideological journey\" in which, from 1959 to 1964, that callow young boxer was transformed into a world champion. (And, yes, I'm a talking head in it, along with Burns's eight-hour epic and too many others.) All of this leaves us with the question of how Ali-or at least a version of Ali-became the Last American Hero. The American dream may be coming apart at the seams, but the glory of The Greatest is in full flower and still growing. Why? The simplest answer-and the most discouraging-may be the right one. There is no one else. In the age of Trump, the Hero Pool has dried up, if at least you ignore the endless movie characters based on comic book super people (or creatures). Even my own childhood fave, Superman, who early in his career battled the Nazis, has lost his dominance. In America, the terrible tribalization of the Trump era has made it almost impossible to consider any kind of consensus hero worship in any genre (Dr. King, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Who?) while culture was becoming as politicized as politics. The usual default for hero worship, sports, has turned into an all-star disaster area and perhaps a leading reason for the idol abyss of the present moment. A Roster of Hyped (and Then Discredited) Heroes Lately, almost every sport has contributed a major disappointment in the form of a hyped hero who came up all too short. Recently and typically, the popular golfer Phil Mickelson was one of a group of PGA pros who signed up for a lucrative tournament in Saudi Arabia (with its murderous regime) at about the same time the number-one tennis player, Novak Djokovic, was trying unsuccessfully to stay and play in Australia while unvaxxed. As we inched toward the February 13th Super Bowl, many began rooting not for but against fan darling Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers who turned out to be another unvaxxed slickster. When the Pittsburgh Steelers were eliminated from the playoffs, their long-time superstar quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was relieved of a full-scale moral review, but he won't be able to avoid it when he becomes a candidate for the Hall of Fame. Among the sportswriters who vote for the future immortals, baseball has similarly had a long-simmering argument over the moral qualifications for its Hall of Fame candidates. And that, as it happens, offers a controversy all its own. Since induction brings a substantial boost in sideshow income, isn't it a conflict of interest for so-called journalists to reward their subjects that way? In any case, the argument over qualifications seems to have boiled down to skirmishes between the Moralists, who can't abide the likes of Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Alex Rodriguez, or Curt Schilling, all of whom have been accused of using performance enhancing drugs, and the Analytics, who believe that only statistics should be the basis for such final judgments. (Allegations of drug use or bad behavior be damned.) Such arguments have devalued the very idea of a Hall of Fame because the statistically minded sportswriters come across as mindless boosters hiding behind numbers, while the Moralists seem like all-too-tiresome finger-pointers. How do you get heroes out of that? The answer is: You don't. So you go back to Ali, who was stripped of his heavyweight title in 1967 after refusing to be drafted into the Vietnam-era Army for religious reasons. It's always worth recalling that he was not penalized by some federal agency or central governing sports body, but rather by scores of politically appointed local boxing commissions. Hero and Villain Ali immediately became both hero and villain, celebrated for a principled stand against the Vietnam War (\"Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam after so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?... I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong\"), vilified for rejecting his country's call of duty, and sentenced to five years in jail for refusing induction, later overturned by the Supreme Court. The passion of those 55-year-old reactions to Ali's draft avoidance were echoed in 2016, several weeks after his death when, in one of sports' most symbolic acts, Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem before a pro football game and instead took a knee. As that season unfolded and Kaepernick became a right-wing target, it seemed as though the San Francisco 49ers' quarterback would prove a worthy successor to Ali as an all-American hero in chief. He, too, was clearly taking a personally dangerous and politically principled stand and his avowed purpose-to call attention to discrimination against people of color-seemed unassailable. But even as Ali remained a secular saint, Kaepernick would be maligned and smoothly sideswiped. He really wasn't such a good quarterback, it was said (although he had led his team to the Super Bowl), and anyway he was nothing but a pawn of the Black Lives Matter movement. Most damaging for Kaepernick, I think, was the lack of white support, especially among other National Football League players. (Black support wasn't so widespread, either.) Ali, of course, never lost the favor of the millions of young white fans against the draft. Ali's hero status remains unsullied, especially because it's been sanitized. The fearsome social warrior of 1967 came, in the end, to be celebrated as something of a teddy bear. Ringing the Wrong Bell The issue of neutering a feared social warrior has been covered most trenchantly by Thomas Hauser, the lawyer and novelist who is Ali's most exhaustive and reliable chronicler. His description of Ali as \"a beacon of hope for oppressed people all over the world\" as well as \"the embodiment of love\" whose \"dreams inspired the world,\" has clearly led to his antipathy toward what he sees as the relentless commercialization of Ali. No example of this was more symbolic than his appearance at the New York Stock Exchange on December 31, 1999. Hauser says he thought Ali should have celebrated that millennial moment \"at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter to draw attention to the plight of the disadvantaged.\" Ali, according to Hauser, was, however, adept at avoiding making rich white people feel guilty or even uncomfortable. The cruelest Ali had ever been publicly was to his most formidable opponent, Joe Frazier, a Black man-calling him a \"gorilla,\" while mocking his nose, lips, and skin. \"In real life,\" writes Hauser, \"Ali played the race card against Frazier in a particularly mean-spirited way. For the entertainment of white America, he labeled Joe as ugly and dumb.

Such arguments have devalued the very idea of a Hall of Fame because the statistically minded sportswriters come across as mindless boosters hiding behind numbers, while the Moralists seem like all-too-tiresome finger-pointers. How do you get heroes out of that? The answer is: You don't. So you go back to Ali, who was stripped of his heavyweight title in 1967 after refusing to be drafted into the Vietnam-era Army for religious reasons. It's always worth recalling that he was not penalized by some federal agency or central governing sports body, but rather by scores of politically appointed local boxing commissions. Hero and Villain Ali immediately became both hero and villain, celebrated for a principled stand against the Vietnam War (\"Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam after so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?... I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong\"), vilified for rejecting his country's call of duty, and sentenced to five years in jail for refusing induction, later overturned by the Supreme Court. The passion of those 55-year-old reactions to Ali's draft avoidance were echoed in 2016, several weeks after his death when, in one of sports' most symbolic acts, Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem before a pro football game and instead took a knee. As that season unfolded and Kaepernick became a right-wing target, it seemed as though the San Francisco 49ers' quarterback would prove a worthy successor to Ali as an all-American hero in chief. He, too, was clearly taking a personally dangerous and politically principled stand and his avowed purpose-to call attention to discrimination against people of color-seemed unassailable. But even as Ali remained a secular saint, Kaepernick would be maligned and smoothly sideswiped. He really wasn't such a good quarterback, it was said (although he had led his team to the Super Bowl), and anyway he was nothing but a pawn of the Black Lives Matter movement. Most damaging for Kaepernick, I think, was the lack of white support, especially among other National Football League players. (Black support wasn't so widespread, either.) Ali, of course, never lost the favor of the millions of young white fans against the draft. Ali's hero status remains unsullied, especially because it's been sanitized. The fearsome social warrior of 1967 came, in the end, to be celebrated as something of a teddy bear. Ringing the Wrong Bell The issue of neutering a feared social warrior has been covered most trenchantly by Thomas Hauser, the lawyer and novelist who is Ali's most exhaustive and reliable chronicler. His description of Ali as \"a beacon of hope for oppressed people all over the world\" as well as \"the embodiment of love\" whose \"dreams inspired the world,\" has clearly led to his antipathy toward what he sees as the relentless commercialization of Ali. No example of this was more symbolic than his appearance at the New York Stock Exchange on December 31, 1999. Hauser says he thought Ali should have celebrated that millennial moment \"at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter to draw attention to the plight of the disadvantaged.\" Ali, according to Hauser, was, however, adept at avoiding making rich white people feel guilty or even uncomfortable. The cruelest Ali had ever been publicly was to his most formidable opponent, Joe Frazier, a Black man-calling him a \"gorilla,\" while mocking his nose, lips, and skin. \"In real life,\" writes Hauser, \"Ali played the race card against Frazier in a particularly mean-spirited way. For the entertainment of white America, he labeled Joe as ugly and dumb. And at the same time, speaking to Black America, he branded Frazier an Uncle Tom, turning him into an object of derision and scorn within the Black community.\" One of the harshest observers of Ali's commodification, Mike Marqusee, author of Redemption Song: Muhammad Ali and the Spirit of the Sixties , broadened such a critique by writing: Ali's power in the third world grew precisely because he was a symbol of defiance against racism and the use of United States military power abroad. And those issues are very much alive today; so, it means a lot to the powers that be if Ali can be used to suggest to the rest of the world that they aren't problems anymore. [Ali's] history is now being plundered and deliberately obscured to sell commercial products and, more significantly, ideas. No wonder I looked for hope in Harmony. After the Zoom interview and some follow-up e-mails, I asked the California eighth grader if she and her project colleagues would answer two short questions: Based on your research, what do you think Ali should be remembered for now? Is that the same thing you might have thought before you did your research? Generously, Harmony offered the views of her classmate, Yaseen, who wrote that he thinks \"Ali should be remembered for being arguably the most iconic athlete of all time and as a hero because he taught young Black people that they could do anything and he should also be remembered for the positivity and love he spread in his life.\" Before researching his life, he had merely thought that Ali \"was a good boxer.\" That was positive. And then, the day that Yaseen's tribute arrived, part of a weekend that would include my birthday, as well as Ali's and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s , a request arrived from a Purdue University graduate student for information about Superman's role in American culture. Many years ago, I had been involved in a TV show that peripherally addressed that subject. Of course, I agreed to answer his questions and started plowing through old notes where I found a reference to a 1978 DC comic book called \"Superman vs. Muhammad Ali\" in which the two team up to defeat an alien invasion of America. My heart raced at that. Alien invasion? We're in the middle of one right now. They're called greedy, gutless Republicans and they seem to be winning. And worse yet, they have a hero whose seedy charisma and shamelessness is enough to inflame his nervous and needy followers. Spoiler alert: in the comic, the good guys win and Ali shouts, \"Superman, WE are the greatest!\" And it's true. Unlike Trump , the champ was willing to share the glory. What more can we expect from a \"hero\" these days?\n\nAll of this leaves us with the question of how Ali-or at least a version of Ali-became the Last American Hero. The American dream may be coming apart at the seams, but the glory of The Greatest is in full flower and still growing. Why? The simplest answer-and the most discouraging-may be the right one. There is no one else. In the age of Trump, the Hero Pool has dried up, if at least you ignore the endless movie characters based on comic book super people (or creatures). Even my own childhood fave, Superman, who early in his career battled the Nazis, has lost his dominance. In America, the terrible tribalization of the Trump era has made it almost impossible to consider any kind of consensus hero worship in any genre (Dr. King, Dr. Fauci, Dr. Who?) while culture was becoming as politicized as politics. The usual default for hero worship, sports, has turned into an all-star disaster area and perhaps a leading reason for the idol abyss of the present moment. A Roster of Hyped (and Then Discredited) Heroes Lately, almost every sport has contributed a major disappointment in the form of a hyped hero who came up all too short. Recently and typically, the popular golfer Phil Mickelson was one of a group of PGA pros who signed up for a lucrative tournament in Saudi Arabia (with its murderous regime) at about the same time the number-one tennis player, Novak Djokovic, was trying unsuccessfully to stay and play in Australia while unvaxxed. As we inched toward the February 13th Super Bowl, many began rooting not for but against fan darling Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers who turned out to be another unvaxxed slickster. When the Pittsburgh Steelers were eliminated from the playoffs, their long-time superstar quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was relieved of a full-scale moral review, but he won't be able to avoid it when he becomes a candidate for the Hall of Fame. Among the sportswriters who vote for the future immortals, baseball has similarly had a long-simmering argument over the moral qualifications for its Hall of Fame candidates. And that, as it happens, offers a controversy all its own. Since induction brings a substantial boost in sideshow income, isn't it a conflict of interest for so-called journalists to reward their subjects that way? In any case, the argument over qualifications seems to have boiled down to skirmishes between the Moralists, who can't abide the likes of Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Alex Rodriguez, or Curt Schilling, all of whom have been accused of using performance enhancing drugs, and the Analytics, who believe that only statistics should be the basis for such final judgments.

As that season unfolded and Kaepernick became a right-wing target, it seemed as though the San Francisco 49ers' quarterback would prove a worthy successor to Ali as an all-American hero in chief. He, too, was clearly taking a personally dangerous and politically principled stand and his avowed purpose-to call attention to discrimination against people of color-seemed unassailable. But even as Ali remained a secular saint, Kaepernick would be maligned and smoothly sideswiped. He really wasn't such a good quarterback, it was said (although he had led his team to the Super Bowl), and anyway he was nothing but a pawn of the Black Lives Matter movement. Most damaging for Kaepernick, I think, was the lack of white support, especially among other National Football League players. (Black support wasn't so widespread, either.) Ali, of course, never lost the favor of the millions of young white fans against the draft. Ali's hero status remains unsullied, especially because it's been sanitized. The fearsome social warrior of 1967 came, in the end, to be celebrated as something of a teddy bear. Ringing the Wrong Bell The issue of neutering a feared social warrior has been covered most trenchantly by Thomas Hauser, the lawyer and novelist who is Ali's most exhaustive and reliable chronicler. His description of Ali as \"a beacon of hope for oppressed people all over the world\" as well as \"the embodiment of love\" whose \"dreams inspired the world,\" has clearly led to his antipathy toward what he sees as the relentless commercialization of Ali. No example of this was more symbolic than his appearance at the New York Stock Exchange on December 31, 1999. Hauser says he thought Ali should have celebrated that millennial moment \"at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter to draw attention to the plight of the disadvantaged.\" Ali, according to Hauser, was, however, adept at avoiding making rich white people feel guilty or even uncomfortable. The cruelest Ali had ever been publicly was to his most formidable opponent, Joe Frazier, a Black man-calling him a \"gorilla,\" while mocking his nose, lips, and skin. \"In real life,\" writes Hauser, \"Ali played the race card against Frazier in a particularly mean-spirited way. For the entertainment of white America, he labeled Joe as ugly and dumb. And at the same time, speaking to Black America, he branded Frazier an Uncle Tom, turning him into an object of derision and scorn within the Black community.\" One of the harshest observers of Ali's commodification, Mike Marqusee, author of Redemption Song: Muhammad Ali and the Spirit of the Sixties , broadened such a critique by writing: Ali's power in the third world grew precisely because he was a symbol of defiance against racism and the use of United States military power abroad. And those issues are very much alive today; so, it means a lot to the powers that be if Ali can be used to suggest to the rest of the world that they aren't problems anymore. [Ali's] history is now being plundered and deliberately obscured to sell commercial products and, more significantly, ideas. No wonder I looked for hope in Harmony. After the Zoom interview and some follow-up e-mails, I asked the California eighth grader if she and her project colleagues would answer two short questions: Based on your research, what do you think Ali should be remembered for now? Is that the same thing you might have thought before you did your research? Generously, Harmony offered the views of her classmate, Yaseen, who wrote that he thinks \"Ali should be remembered for being arguably the most iconic athlete of all time and as a hero because he taught young Black people that they could do anything and he should also be remembered for the positivity and love he spread in his life.\" Before researching his life, he had merely thought that Ali \"was a good boxer.\" That was positive. And then, the day that Yaseen's tribute arrived, part of a weekend that would include my birthday, as well as Ali's and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s , a request arrived from a Purdue University graduate student for information about Superman's role in American culture. Many years ago, I had been involved in a TV show that peripherally addressed that subject. Of course, I agreed to answer his questions and started plowing through old notes where I found a reference to a 1978 DC comic book called \"Superman vs. Muhammad Ali\" in which the two team up to defeat an alien invasion of America. My heart raced at that. Alien invasion? We're in the middle of one right now. They're called greedy, gutless Republicans and they seem to be winning. And worse yet, they have a hero whose seedy charisma and shamelessness is enough to inflame his nervous and needy followers. Spoiler alert: in the comic, the good guys win and Ali shouts, \"Superman, WE are the greatest!\" And it's true. Unlike Trump , the champ was willing to share the glory. What more can we expect from a \"hero\" these days?\n\nAs we inched toward the February 13th Super Bowl, many began rooting not for but against fan darling Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers who turned out to be another unvaxxed slickster. When the Pittsburgh Steelers were eliminated from the playoffs, their long-time superstar quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was relieved of a full-scale moral review, but he won't be able to avoid it when he becomes a candidate for the Hall of Fame. Among the sportswriters who vote for the future immortals, baseball has similarly had a long-simmering argument over the moral qualifications for its Hall of Fame candidates. And that, as it happens, offers a controversy all its own. Since induction brings a substantial boost in sideshow income, isn't it a conflict of interest for so-called journalists to reward their subjects that way? In any case, the argument over qualifications seems to have boiled down to skirmishes between the Moralists, who can't abide the likes of Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Alex Rodriguez, or Curt Schilling, all of whom have been accused of using performance enhancing drugs, and the Analytics, who believe that only statistics should be the basis for such final judgments. (Allegations of drug use or bad behavior be damned.) Such arguments have devalued the very idea of a Hall of Fame because the statistically minded sportswriters come across as mindless boosters hiding behind numbers, while the Moralists seem like all-too-tiresome finger-pointers. How do you get heroes out of that? The answer is: You don't. So you go back to Ali, who was stripped of his heavyweight title in 1967 after refusing to be drafted into the Vietnam-era Army for religious reasons. It's always worth recalling that he was not penalized by some federal agency or central governing sports body, but rather by scores of politically appointed local boxing commissions. Hero and Villain Ali immediately became both hero and villain, celebrated for a principled stand against the Vietnam War (\"Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam after so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?... I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong\"), vilified for rejecting his country's call of duty, and sentenced to five years in jail for refusing induction, later overturned by the Supreme Court.

No example of this was more symbolic than his appearance at the New York Stock Exchange on December 31, 1999. Hauser says he thought Ali should have celebrated that millennial moment \"at a soup kitchen or homeless shelter to draw attention to the plight of the disadvantaged.\" Ali, according to Hauser, was, however, adept at avoiding making rich white people feel guilty or even uncomfortable. The cruelest Ali had ever been publicly was to his most formidable opponent, Joe Frazier, a Black man-calling him a \"gorilla,\" while mocking his nose, lips, and skin. \"In real life,\" writes Hauser, \"Ali played the race card against Frazier in a particularly mean-spirited way. For the entertainment of white America, he labeled Joe as ugly and dumb. And at the same time, speaking to Black America, he branded Frazier an Uncle Tom, turning him into an object of derision and scorn within the Black community.\" One of the harshest observers of Ali's commodification, Mike Marqusee, author of Redemption Song: Muhammad Ali and the Spirit of the Sixties , broadened such a critique by writing: Ali's power in the third world grew precisely because he was a symbol of defiance against racism and the use of United States military power abroad. And those issues are very much alive today; so, it means a lot to the powers that be if Ali can be used to suggest to the rest of the world that they aren't problems anymore. [Ali's] history is now being plundered and deliberately obscured to sell commercial products and, more significantly, ideas. No wonder I looked for hope in Harmony. After the Zoom interview and some follow-up e-mails, I asked the California eighth grader if she and her project colleagues would answer two short questions: Based on your research, what do you think Ali should be remembered for now? Is that the same thing you might have thought before you did your research? Generously, Harmony offered the views of her classmate, Yaseen, who wrote that he thinks \"Ali should be remembered for being arguably the most iconic athlete of all time and as a hero because he taught young Black people that they could do anything and he should also be remembered for the positivity and love he spread in his life.\" Before researching his life, he had merely thought that Ali \"was a good boxer.\" That was positive. And then, the day that Yaseen's tribute arrived, part of a weekend that would include my birthday, as well as Ali's and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s , a request arrived from a Purdue University graduate student for information about Superman's role in American culture. Many years ago, I had been involved in a TV show that peripherally addressed that subject. Of course, I agreed to answer his questions and started plowing through old notes where I found a reference to a 1978 DC comic book called \"Superman vs. Muhammad Ali\" in which the two team up to defeat an alien invasion of America. My heart raced at that. Alien invasion? We're in the middle of one right now. They're called greedy, gutless Republicans and they seem to be winning. And worse yet, they have a hero whose seedy charisma and shamelessness is enough to inflame his nervous and needy followers. Spoiler alert: in the comic, the good guys win and Ali shouts, \"Superman, WE are the greatest!\" And it's true. Unlike Trump , the champ was willing to share the glory. What more can we expect from a \"hero\" these days?\n\nAli immediately became both hero and villain, celebrated for a principled stand against the Vietnam War (\"Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam after so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?... I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong\"), vilified for rejecting his country's call of duty, and sentenced to five years in jail for refusing induction, later overturned by the Supreme Court. The passion of those 55-year-old reactions to Ali's draft avoidance were echoed in 2016, several weeks after his death when, in one of sports' most symbolic acts, Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem before a pro football game and instead took a knee. As that season unfolded and Kaepernick became a right-wing target, it seemed as though the San Francisco 49ers' quarterback would prove a worthy successor to Ali as an all-American hero in chief. He, too, was clearly taking a personally dangerous and politically principled stand and his avowed purpose-to call attention to discrimination against people of color-seemed unassailable. But even as Ali remained a secular saint, Kaepernick would be maligned and smoothly sideswiped. He really wasn't such a good quarterback, it was said (although he had led his team to the Super Bowl), and anyway he was nothing but a pawn of the Black Lives Matter movement. Most damaging for Kaepernick, I think, was the lack of white support, especially among other National Football League players. (Black support wasn't so widespread, either.) Ali, of course, never lost the favor of the millions of young white fans against the draft. Ali's hero status remains unsullied, especially because it's been sanitized. The fearsome social warrior of 1967 came, in the end, to be celebrated as something of a teddy bear.

After the Zoom interview and some follow-up e-mails, I asked the California eighth grader if she and her project colleagues would answer two short questions: Based on your research, what do you think Ali should be remembered for now? Is that the same thing you might have thought before you did your research? Generously, Harmony offered the views of her classmate, Yaseen, who wrote that he thinks \"Ali should be remembered for being arguably the most iconic athlete of all time and as a hero because he taught young Black people that they could do anything and he should also be remembered for the positivity and love he spread in his life.\" Before researching his life, he had merely thought that Ali \"was a good boxer.\" That was positive. And then, the day that Yaseen's tribute arrived, part of a weekend that would include my birthday, as well as Ali's and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s , a request arrived from a Purdue University graduate student for information about Superman's role in American culture. Many years ago, I had been involved in a TV show that peripherally addressed that subject. Of course, I agreed to answer his questions and started plowing through old notes where I found a reference to a 1978 DC comic book called \"Superman vs. Muhammad Ali\" in which the two team up to defeat an alien invasion of America. My heart raced at that. Alien invasion? We're in the middle of one right now. They're called greedy, gutless Republicans and they seem to be winning. And worse yet, they have a hero whose seedy charisma and shamelessness is enough to inflame his nervous and needy followers. Spoiler alert: in the comic, the good guys win and Ali shouts, \"Superman, WE are the greatest!\" And it's true. Unlike Trump , the champ was willing to share the glory. What more can we expect from a \"hero\" these days?\n\nGenerously, Harmony offered the views of her classmate, Yaseen, who wrote that he thinks \"Ali should be remembered for being arguably the most iconic athlete of all time and as a hero because he taught young Black people that they could do anything and he should also be remembered for the positivity and love he spread in his life.\" Before researching his life, he had merely thought that Ali \"was a good boxer.\" That was positive.

Activate your online access\n\nMusk and his PAC are effectively paying people in swing states to register to vote, and that is a clear violation of federal law.\n\nElon Musk awarded Kristine Fishell with a $1 million check during the town hall at the Roxain Theater on October 20, 2024, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\nElon Musk is-effectively-paying people to register to vote. This is a violation of federal election laws, and he should be prosecuted, fined, and imprisoned for his numerous violations. Unfortunately, this is Elon Musk we're talking about, and the person responsible for enforcing federal laws against him is Attorney General Merrick Garland-and all of that means that Musk will not be prosecuted, fined, or sent to prison. The rules, you see, are different for rich white Republicans who violate the laws than they are for anyone else. I thought everybody knew that by now.\n\nWhat Musk is doing is not complicated, but there's enough misdirection in his scheme that it can be confusing to see what he's up to. So allow me to explain. Through his political action committee, Musk is offering $1,000,000, lottery style, to people in \"battleground\" states-specifically, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan, and North Carolina-who sign his PAC's petition. The petition is a general pledge to \"support\" the First and Second Amendment (because of course a white South African whose family benefited from apartheid is somewhat more interested in supporting the Second Amendment than, say, the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, which prevent people like Musk from doing here what people like Musk did in South Africa). If you sign the petition, you have a chance of winning a million bucks. Musk handed out the first check last weekend.\n\nPaying people, or offering people a lottery ticket, to sign a petition is legal . That's fine. It's an exercise of free speech, at least in this ridiculous country that equates money with speech.\n\nThe problem with Musk's scheme is that, in order to get the money, you have to be registered to vote. By making voter registration key to getting the money, Musk is trying to induce people who are not registered to register to vote. That is illegal . As the elections law expert Rick Hasen points out , paying people, bribing people, or giving people pretty much anything of monetary value to induce them to register to vote is a violation of federal law.\n\nFor those playing along at home, the law Hasen points to is 52 U.S.C. 10307(c ), which states: \"Whoever knowingly or willfully gives false information as to his name, address or period of residence in the voting district for the purpose of establishing his eligibility to register or vote, or conspires with another individual for the purpose of encouraging his false registration to vote or illegal voting, or pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for voting shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\" (Emphasis Hasen's.)\n\nThe Department of Justice has clarified that this law does not apply to, say, giving voters a ride to the polls. But it does include giving people cash, or liquor, or food stamps, or... \"lottery chances\" to induce them to register.\n\nMusk is violating the law, but for that to matter somebody has to prosecute him for his violations, and that job, unfortunately, rests with Merrick Garland. Garland sent Musk and his PAC a letter earlier this week in which he \"warned\" that they \"could\" be violating federal law. Garland is reportedly monitoring and investigating the situation. Musk ignored the warning and announced more winners .\n\nI know there are still people who would like to defend Garland's historic inability to enforce any laws against Republican political actors, but, honestly, Garland's response is beyond pathetic. It takes a Google search and half an hour of Westlaw access to \"investigate\" whether \"Hoo boy, register to vote and have a chance to win a million dollars\" violates applicable federal standards. The Department of Justice's own \" Election Crimes Manual \" explains that what Musk is doing is illegal. Garland need only \"investigate\" the rules written down by his own institution to figure out that Musk is in violation of the law.\n\nThe strongly worded letter Garland sent to Musk should have been a legal complaint, filed in court, and served to Musk while he was on stage handing out the freaking check.\n\nBut while Garland continues to be a national embarrassment, incapable of doing anything that might anger the Republican base, the sad reality is that even bringing the full force of the law against Musk would not stop his illegal actions. That's because the full force of the law is incredibly weak in this instance and of little consequence to a rich white man.\n\nAstute readers will have noticed that the penalty for violating the law at issue is a fine of \"not more than $10,000\" or imprisonment of \"not more than five years, or both.\" Musk is not going to go to jail because of this. We don't put white people in jail for violating federal election laws, especially not when they are first-time offenders and the violation is as technical as this one is. (People, white people mainly, are going to object to my pointing out that Musk's race is helping him get away with this, but please, how quickly do you think Oprah would find her ass in jail if she went to Houston and offered $1,000,000 to anybody who registered to vote and signed her petition saying \"I support Black women\"?) Also: Violations of this nature are always, or almost always (see the above Oprah thought experiment) addressed with a fine, in the first instance.\n\nThat fine should be $10,000. For Elon Musk. I'd say the fine is loose change for him, but the actual change you have rattling around in your pockets and hidden in your couch cushions is probably a greater percentage of your net worth than $10,000 is to Elon Musk's billions. Even if you fined him $10,000 for every violation-that is, $10,000 for every voter who registered for a chance to win his lotto-the fine would not deter his behavior one bit.\n\nAnd so, Elon Musk is paying Republicans to register to vote in battleground states, and there's nothing we can really do to stop him.\n\nWith that brute reality in mind, my actual advice is that Democrats in battleground states should also register to vote and sign Musk's petition. Maybe you will win the $1,000,000 bucks. Then you can get up on stage, get your check, and rip open your shirt to show that you were a Harris voter all along.

I know it's hard to imagine Manhattan as ever having farmland, but \"the city\" remained densely clustered on the southern tip of the island well into the 19th century. 1 Coming to a bookstore near you: This article is an excerpt from Elie Mystal's forthcoming book, Allow Me to Retort: A Black Guy's Guide to the Constitution , to be published by the New Press on March 1. The first three lots of the Whiteheads' land were bought for $125 by a shoe shiner named Andrew Williams. Williams was a Black man, and the Whiteheads were among the very few white landowners who would sell to Black people back then. 2 Williams was a member of the New York African Society for Mutual Relief. The group sought to help Black people buy real estate and was moderately successful at helping the Black middle class gain a foothold in New York. Other Black families began buying land from the Whiteheads in the area around Williams's new plot. A Black store clerk named Epiphany Davis bought 12 lots for $578. The African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church bought six lots, and the village became even more desirable to Black middle-class families. Irish immigrants, another group of \"undesirables\" the Whiteheads were willing to sell to, bought many of the other lots. The Whiteheads ended up selling half of their lots to Black people. The little enclave they made was known as Seneca Village. According to census data, in 1855 Seneca Village had 264 residents, three churches, three cemeteries, and two schools. 3 Seneca Village was a home of political power for Black people as well. Remember, in 1855 there were no 14th or 15th Amendments. There was no guaranteed right to vote for African Americans, even free ones living in the North. To be eligible to vote in New York State in the 1850s, a Black man needed to be a male landowner in possession of $250 worth of property and have state residency for three years. Neither the property nor the residency requirements applied to white men. Seneca Village was a way for some Black men to meet that property requirement. Of the 100 Black people eligible to vote in New York State in 1845, 10 lived in Seneca Village. Five years later, in 1850, of the 71 Black property owners in New York City, 20 percent lived in Seneca Village. 4 By 1857, however, the entire area had been razed to the ground. The homes and churches were demolished, and the people were scattered. Seneca Village did not fall to some natural disaster, or even the ubiquitous mob of angry whites that shows up, again and again, throughout American history to lynch Black people who seem to be getting ahead. No, Seneca Village was destroyed because in 1853 New York passed a law allowing for the construction of Central Park. 5 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Map of Seneca Village. (Courtesy of NYC Municipal Archives) Lost neighbors: Residents of Seneca Village, a thriving Black community that was razed to the ground to make way for Central Park. S eneca Village was located in what is now thought of as the west side of Central Park. Its boundaries extended from about 82nd Street to 89th Street, between what is now Central Park West and where Seventh Avenue would be if it extended straight through the park. Seneca Village was a small and arguably unnecessary part of the 775 acres of land set aside by the legislature to create the park. 6 The government had the authority to buy or \"take\" the land for Central Park under the doctrine of eminent domain, which is enshrined in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Eminent domain is the theory that all land, even private property, can be acquired by the government if it is in the public interest. The relevant part of the Fifth Amendment reads: 7 Current Issue View our current issue No person shall be...deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. 8 Eminent domain is such a core concept of sovereignty that the US Supreme Court has said that it doesn't even require a constitutional provision. But compensation for exercising that inherent sovereign authority does require some constitutional language. 9 To understand eminent domain, you have to appreciate that, if you start from first principles, all land is \"public.\" All land is just there, claimed only by whoever or whatever happens to be standing on it, and can physically defend it, at a particular time. It's all God's land, if you're into that sort of thing. Or the king's land, if you lived in pretty much any pre-Enlightenment society. 10 Pillars of the community: Albro Lyons and Mary Joseph Marshall, noted abolitionists, owned plots of land in Seneca Village. \"Private\" property has surely always existed in some form-I'm certain that some of the ancient art we've uncovered and put in our museums was actually early modern \"Beware of Bear\" signs fashioned by cavemen who were sick of being solicited at their homes. But as a standing inalienable legal concept, fully private property that rulers are not allowed to violate at will is new (in geologic time) and kind of weird. Entire philosophical tracts on government (including the only one most people have ever heard of: John Locke's second treatise on government) have been written to explain, more or less, why private property should exist at all. Private property is not the natural or inevitable result of settled society. 11 Different legal systems treat the concept of private ownership differently. Take, for instance, the initial \"purchase\" of Manhattan Island by the Dutch . In 1626 Peter Minuit, director of New Netherland, reported that he bought Manhattan for 60 guilders (about $24, according to 19th-century historians). It would be too glib and easy to say that the Indigenous people who sold him the land didn't understand private property. As Arizona State law professor Robert Miller makes clear, they likely did have a fully functional concept of property \"exclusivity.\" But we would probably call the land deal a \"lease,\" not a \"purchase.\" In his book Law in American History , University of Virginia law professor G. Edward White makes the case that the Native Lenape were \"not relinquishing the island, but simply welcoming the Dutch as additional occupants.\" It was the colonizers who didn't understand or respect the deal. 12 Unlike private property, eminent domain does flow naturally and inevitably from the concept that ownership exists only insofar as the state is able to secure and defend the territory. If the state needs your land for some public purpose, and you can't raise an army to oppose the state, your land is forfeited. Living in a state that is willing to pay for the private land it needs to take is just a modern invention for property owners who would otherwise get screwed if they happen to live on land the state needs. Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius, whose On the Law of War and Peace from 1625 is one of the first real texts of international law, wrote: \"The property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the state.... But when this is done the state is bound to make good the loss to those who lose their property.\" That's the nice way of saying: \"There wouldn't be a West India Company without these fortifications, but here, take some money and go.\" The Dutch didn't really \"own\" Manhattan in 1626, because they couldn't defend Manhattan in 1626. Indeed, Wall Street is so named because there used to be a defensive freaking wall there. The wall was built by slaves the Dutch also \"bought\" and brought with them to defend the settlement of New Amsterdam from attacks by the Indigenous Americans, the British, or pirates. 13 Now, I would love to tell you what James Madison, author of the Fifth Amendment, meant by \"just compensation.\" But I can't. I can't even tell you why eminent domain is tacked onto this amendment and not some other. I can tell you that Madison's initial proposed language was: \"No person shall be...obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without just compensation.\" Congress changed it to its final version, but I can't tell you why. No record of whatever debate may have occurred exists. No Federalist Paper focuses on this particular topic. 14 What I can tell you is that when white people want your shit, they will take it, and Black people will rarely be justly compensated for the destruction of their wealth. 15 Marking the spot: A protest on Juneteenth in 2020 ended with a gathering at the site where Seneca Village once stood. gathering at the site where Seneca Village once stood. (Frank Franklin II / AP) F ighting against eminent domain has become a bit of a cause célèbre for libertarian forces on the right. They've even given it one of their cool, right-wing names, so that their entire objection can fit on the bumper sticker on somebody's truck. They call eminent domain actions \"takings.\" Get it? The government is \"taking\" your stuff; who could support that, right? 16 Much of the heat on the right is over what constitutes a taking at all. Eminent domain certainly refers to physical takings: You had some land and now you don't. But arguably, eminent domain should also come into play when the government dictates how you are allowed to use your property. These instances are called \"regulatory takings,\" and they happen when, say, the government declares your private property a national historic site and thus prevents you from demolishing it and building a CVS. How much compensation is the government required to give out then? 17 Another large area of contention happens when the government takes only part of your property. Let's say that the government wants to place a few wind turbines on part of your land. The private property owner can still live there, so is it a taking at all? What if the wind turbines are super noisy? What if they \"cause cancer\"? (Author's note: They don't.) What if they're really quiet but super ugly? What is the just compensation for ruining your view? 18 If you know anything about Republicans, you understand why the right-wingers get up for this fight, and you can see why liberals are generally on the side of the government when it comes to eminent domain. We need things like wind turbines and historic sites much more than we need libertarians bitching and moaning about whether they received enough of a vig from the government for their troubles. 19 If I were a Republican, I would spend the next 30 minutes of your life telling you about a 2005 case called Kelo v. City of New London . Conservatives complain about this case more than Pharaoh complained about Yahweh. The case is about a white lady, Susette Kelo, who didn't want to sell her pink house. In a twist to the standard eminent domain case, New London, Conn., wanted to acquire her land to then sell it to a private developer, which created a Supreme Court battle. In a controversial 5-4 decision, the liberal wing of the court, joined by Anthony Kennedy, ruled that taking private property and then selling it to private interests for economic redevelopment was indeed a constitutional use of the government's eminent domain power. 20 Conservatives went nuts. They made a fucking movie about this lady and her stupid house. Parts of the house were moved and \"rededicated\" at a new site, and it's now some kind of monument to the fight against big government overreach. 21 Reluctantly, I agree with the Republicans about this issue. Clarence Thomas, in dissent in Kelo , said that the majority was converting the \"public use\" allowed by the Fifth Amendment into any vague promise of a \"public purpose.\" And, God help me, I think Thomas was right about that. The government should not use its powers of eminent domain to essentially acquire land on the cheap for business interests, just because those businesses promise that there will be some public purpose behind their profit motive. For instance, I don't think the government should be involved in acquiring land to build sports arenas that will be owned by wealthy team owners and used to pump the valuation of their sports franchises into the billions. 22 My problem with Kelo is that centering this issue on a white homeowner and the legal distinction between public \"use\" versus \"purpose\" ignores entire Black and brown communities that have been wiped off the damn map by the government's use of eminent domain. Where's the movie about Seneca Village? Where's the movie about the Black and Latino renters who get crushed every time the local team wants a new stadium? Where's the movie about all the people and communities who were destroyed by former New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses? 23 Yeah, if we're going to talk about eminent domain, we're going to talk about how many of our roads, highways, and beaches were figuratively built on top of the bones of Black and brown people who used to live there. I'm sorry, I just can't get up for this lawyer fight between public use and public purpose, when the government's definition of public use is so often merely \"playthings for white people,\" as if that's an acceptable constitutional definition of the term. 24 \"Little pink house\": Susette Kelo stands outside her home, which became a symbol in 2005 of the abuse of eminent domain. (Spencer Platt / Getty Images) T he first time I heard about eminent domain was in college, where I read Robert Caro's seminal book The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York . Moses is responsible for so much of the way modern cities look and feel, and not just in New York, because his methods were imported and copied throughout the country. Moses was a destroyer of Black and brown communities. And eminent domain is what allowed that asshole to be racist at an industrial scale. 25 If I may summarize one of the greatest modern biographies ever written in two sentences: Robert Moses was a deeply racist man who built highways, bridges, parks, beaches, and even housing projects by bulldozing the hopes, dreams, and often homes of people in his way. His main tactic for acquiring land for his projects was identifying vulnerable minority or immigrant communities, declaring their homes and land \"blighted,\" and then using the government's power of eminent domain to evict people from their homes over their objections and for a fraction of what their communities were actually worth. 26 Declaring a community \"blighted\" or a home \"condemned\" is a favorite trick of the government when it wants to avoid paying just compensation for the land it takes. It's what Moses did, repeatedly, throughout New York City in the 1930s, '40s, '50s, and into the '60s. Moses would target a community, have state assessors declare it a \"slum,\" and acquire the land through eminent domain at cut-rate prices. And it's a method many cities and states would copy under the guise of \"urban renewal.\" 27 Urban renewal laws authorize the state to seize land it has designated blighted and deteriorated in some way. The New York State urban renewal law is codified in Article 15 of New York Consolidated Laws, Section 500. Look at how the law describes the purpose of the policy in Section 501: 28 There exist in many municipalities within this state residential, non-residential, commercial, industrial or vacant areas, and combinations thereof, which are slum or blighted, or which are becoming slum or blighted areas because of substandard, insanitary, deteriorated or deteriorating conditions, factors, and characteristics, with or without tangible physical blight. The existence of such areas constitutes a serious and growing menace, is injurious to the public safety, health, morals and welfare, contributes increasingly to the spread of crime, juvenile delinquency and disease, necessitates excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for all forms of public service and constitutes a negative influence on adjacent properties impairing their economic soundness and stability, thereby threatening the source of public revenues. 29 Moses's domain: Robert Moses studies a map in 1958.

My home, this is.\" Clearing out \"the slums\" and replacing run-down and dilapidated-looking buildings with fresh, shiny, economically productive buildings and infrastructure sounds like a great plan, unless you are the person being cleared out. Then, not only are you being displaced from your community, your \"just compensation\" becomes slum prices, leaving you only enough money to go and try to find a different slum to live in. The government usually doesn't pay people in so-called blighted communities what their homes are worth, and never pays them what the land will be worth after all the happy-clappy urban renewal takes place. 30 This is why eminent domain so often takes advantage of vulnerable people and communities. The government doesn't actually want to pay a fair price for the land and doesn't want to fight legal battles against well-connected and powerful communities who can protect their property and interests in court. 31 \"Condemnation\" is what happened to Susette Kelo's property, before the government took it. 32 The remains of San Juan Hill , the neighborhood Robert Moses erased to make way for Lincoln Center, seen rising in the background.

We can go all the way back to the creation of Central Park a century and a half earlier and find the same tactics at play. An enormous park measuring 775 acres (today the park is actually 843 acres) in the middle of the island was not actually the first plan for an open green space in New York City. The first suggested site was a parcel of land, about 150 acres, along the East River between what is now 66th Street and 75th Street, known as Jones's Wood. In 1851, the New York State Assembly and Senate both passed resolutions to take the Jones's Wood property through eminent domain. It was happening. 33 More from Mystal The Many Remarkable Black Women Who Could Replace Stephen Breyer Elie Mystal Clarence and Ginni Thomas, the Supreme Court's Unethical \"It\" Couple Elie Mystal But the wealthy white landowners-John Jones's heirs, and another wealthy New York family, the Schermerhorns, whose property was included in some of the proposals for the park-didn't want to sell the land. Understand, neither the Joneses nor the Schermerhorns lived on the property full-time; this was the 1850s, and the Upper East Side might as well have been a Mars colony. The Joneses' and the Schermerhorns' primary residences were downtown, where any self-respecting wealthy New Yorker would live. These people just didn't want to sell their undeveloped \"country\" estates uptown to the city for a public works project. So the families sued New York State to block the state's taking of their land. 34 Did I mention that the Joneses and the Schermerhorns were white? They were white. And since they were white, all of the stuff I said earlier about the foundational principles of state sovereignty that eminent domain rests on, all of the stuff I said about how, legally speaking, the concept of eminent domain is so ingrained in the very conception of property that you scarcely need constitutional language acknowledging it, all of that stuff comes with the caveat of \"unless you are wealthy and white.\" 35 Of course, the Joneses and the Schermerhorns won their lawsuit against the state. Of course they did. A court ruled that the state resolution to acquire the property through eminent domain violated the due process rights of rich white people. Apparently the resolution allowed the state to back out of the deal but didn't allow the Joneses and the Schermerhorns the same right. I'd point out that of course the Joneses and the Schermerhorns had no right to \"back out\" of the deal, because the state was using its unquestionable sovereign power to force the families into taking the \"deal\" whether they liked it or not, but now I'm just shaking my fist at white judges who have been dead for 150 years. 36 And so, instead of displacing two white families who didn't even use their land as their primary residence, the city went forward with a new plan that included displacing over 200 Black people in Seneca Village who had built up an independent Black community on some of the only land they were allowed to purchase. All of the tricks that would later be deployed against Black communities in the 20th century were used against the people of Seneca Village in the 19th century. The newspapers called their land a \"swamp.\" The media called the people living there \"squatters\" (even though, again, 20 percent of the Black homeowners in all of New York City lived there), and, of course, the papers referred to their community as a \"n***er village.\" 37 The residents of Seneca Village also went to court to object to the government taking their land, but unlike the wealthy white families, they lost in court every time. The landowners were paid an average of $700 per lot. Andrew Williams, that shoe shiner turned landowner who bought the first lots from the Whiteheads, was paid $2,335 for his three lots and house, even though he initially asked for $3,500 in \"just compensation.\" Even when taking his land and destroying the community he helped to found, the state couldn't be bothered to pay the man what he asked for. 38 The Time Warner Center is a relatively recent construction that sits right at the southwestern entrance to Central Park. It sits on about two acres of land and is valued at approximately $1.5 billion. 39 New York City should go and find all the descendants of Seneca Village and pay them what their land is actually worth. I bet the government would be more cautious and fair when using its power of eminent domain if the compensation were ever just. 40\n\nComing to a bookstore near you: This article is an excerpt from Elie Mystal's forthcoming book, Allow Me to Retort: A Black Guy's Guide to the Constitution , to be published by the New Press on March 1.\n\nThe first three lots of the Whiteheads' land were bought for $125 by a shoe shiner named Andrew Williams. Williams was a Black man, and the Whiteheads were among the very few white landowners who would sell to Black people back then. 2 Williams was a member of the New York African Society for Mutual Relief. The group sought to help Black people buy real estate and was moderately successful at helping the Black middle class gain a foothold in New York. Other Black families began buying land from the Whiteheads in the area around Williams's new plot. A Black store clerk named Epiphany Davis bought 12 lots for $578. The African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church bought six lots, and the village became even more desirable to Black middle-class families. Irish immigrants, another group of \"undesirables\" the Whiteheads were willing to sell to, bought many of the other lots. The Whiteheads ended up selling half of their lots to Black people. The little enclave they made was known as Seneca Village. According to census data, in 1855 Seneca Village had 264 residents, three churches, three cemeteries, and two schools. 3 Seneca Village was a home of political power for Black people as well. Remember, in 1855 there were no 14th or 15th Amendments. There was no guaranteed right to vote for African Americans, even free ones living in the North. To be eligible to vote in New York State in the 1850s, a Black man needed to be a male landowner in possession of $250 worth of property and have state residency for three years. Neither the property nor the residency requirements applied to white men. Seneca Village was a way for some Black men to meet that property requirement. Of the 100 Black people eligible to vote in New York State in 1845, 10 lived in Seneca Village. Five years later, in 1850, of the 71 Black property owners in New York City, 20 percent lived in Seneca Village. 4 By 1857, however, the entire area had been razed to the ground. The homes and churches were demolished, and the people were scattered. Seneca Village did not fall to some natural disaster, or even the ubiquitous mob of angry whites that shows up, again and again, throughout American history to lynch Black people who seem to be getting ahead. No, Seneca Village was destroyed because in 1853 New York passed a law allowing for the construction of Central Park. 5 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Map of Seneca Village. (Courtesy of NYC Municipal Archives) Lost neighbors: Residents of Seneca Village, a thriving Black community that was razed to the ground to make way for Central Park. S eneca Village was located in what is now thought of as the west side of Central Park. Its boundaries extended from about 82nd Street to 89th Street, between what is now Central Park West and where Seventh Avenue would be if it extended straight through the park. Seneca Village was a small and arguably unnecessary part of the 775 acres of land set aside by the legislature to create the park. 6 The government had the authority to buy or \"take\" the land for Central Park under the doctrine of eminent domain, which is enshrined in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Eminent domain is the theory that all land, even private property, can be acquired by the government if it is in the public interest. The relevant part of the Fifth Amendment reads: 7 Current Issue View our current issue No person shall be...deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. 8 Eminent domain is such a core concept of sovereignty that the US Supreme Court has said that it doesn't even require a constitutional provision. But compensation for exercising that inherent sovereign authority does require some constitutional language. 9 To understand eminent domain, you have to appreciate that, if you start from first principles, all land is \"public.\" All land is just there, claimed only by whoever or whatever happens to be standing on it, and can physically defend it, at a particular time. It's all God's land, if you're into that sort of thing. Or the king's land, if you lived in pretty much any pre-Enlightenment society. 10 Pillars of the community: Albro Lyons and Mary Joseph Marshall, noted abolitionists, owned plots of land in Seneca Village. \"Private\" property has surely always existed in some form-I'm certain that some of the ancient art we've uncovered and put in our museums was actually early modern \"Beware of Bear\" signs fashioned by cavemen who were sick of being solicited at their homes. But as a standing inalienable legal concept, fully private property that rulers are not allowed to violate at will is new (in geologic time) and kind of weird. Entire philosophical tracts on government (including the only one most people have ever heard of: John Locke's second treatise on government) have been written to explain, more or less, why private property should exist at all. Private property is not the natural or inevitable result of settled society. 11 Different legal systems treat the concept of private ownership differently. Take, for instance, the initial \"purchase\" of Manhattan Island by the Dutch . In 1626 Peter Minuit, director of New Netherland, reported that he bought Manhattan for 60 guilders (about $24, according to 19th-century historians). It would be too glib and easy to say that the Indigenous people who sold him the land didn't understand private property. As Arizona State law professor Robert Miller makes clear, they likely did have a fully functional concept of property \"exclusivity.\" But we would probably call the land deal a \"lease,\" not a \"purchase.\" In his book Law in American History , University of Virginia law professor G. Edward White makes the case that the Native Lenape were \"not relinquishing the island, but simply welcoming the Dutch as additional occupants.\" It was the colonizers who didn't understand or respect the deal. 12 Unlike private property, eminent domain does flow naturally and inevitably from the concept that ownership exists only insofar as the state is able to secure and defend the territory. If the state needs your land for some public purpose, and you can't raise an army to oppose the state, your land is forfeited. Living in a state that is willing to pay for the private land it needs to take is just a modern invention for property owners who would otherwise get screwed if they happen to live on land the state needs. Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius, whose On the Law of War and Peace from 1625 is one of the first real texts of international law, wrote: \"The property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the state.... But when this is done the state is bound to make good the loss to those who lose their property.\" That's the nice way of saying: \"There wouldn't be a West India Company without these fortifications, but here, take some money and go.\" The Dutch didn't really \"own\" Manhattan in 1626, because they couldn't defend Manhattan in 1626. Indeed, Wall Street is so named because there used to be a defensive freaking wall there. The wall was built by slaves the Dutch also \"bought\" and brought with them to defend the settlement of New Amsterdam from attacks by the Indigenous Americans, the British, or pirates. 13 Now, I would love to tell you what James Madison, author of the Fifth Amendment, meant by \"just compensation.\" But I can't. I can't even tell you why eminent domain is tacked onto this amendment and not some other. I can tell you that Madison's initial proposed language was: \"No person shall be...obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without just compensation.\" Congress changed it to its final version, but I can't tell you why. No record of whatever debate may have occurred exists. No Federalist Paper focuses on this particular topic. 14 What I can tell you is that when white people want your shit, they will take it, and Black people will rarely be justly compensated for the destruction of their wealth. 15 Marking the spot: A protest on Juneteenth in 2020 ended with a gathering at the site where Seneca Village once stood. gathering at the site where Seneca Village once stood. (Frank Franklin II / AP) F ighting against eminent domain has become a bit of a cause célèbre for libertarian forces on the right. They've even given it one of their cool, right-wing names, so that their entire objection can fit on the bumper sticker on somebody's truck. They call eminent domain actions \"takings.\" Get it? The government is \"taking\" your stuff; who could support that, right? 16 Much of the heat on the right is over what constitutes a taking at all. Eminent domain certainly refers to physical takings: You had some land and now you don't. But arguably, eminent domain should also come into play when the government dictates how you are allowed to use your property. These instances are called \"regulatory takings,\" and they happen when, say, the government declares your private property a national historic site and thus prevents you from demolishing it and building a CVS. How much compensation is the government required to give out then? 17 Another large area of contention happens when the government takes only part of your property. Let's say that the government wants to place a few wind turbines on part of your land. The private property owner can still live there, so is it a taking at all? What if the wind turbines are super noisy? What if they \"cause cancer\"? (Author's note: They don't.) What if they're really quiet but super ugly? What is the just compensation for ruining your view? 18 If you know anything about Republicans, you understand why the right-wingers get up for this fight, and you can see why liberals are generally on the side of the government when it comes to eminent domain. We need things like wind turbines and historic sites much more than we need libertarians bitching and moaning about whether they received enough of a vig from the government for their troubles. 19 If I were a Republican, I would spend the next 30 minutes of your life telling you about a 2005 case called Kelo v. City of New London . Conservatives complain about this case more than Pharaoh complained about Yahweh. The case is about a white lady, Susette Kelo, who didn't want to sell her pink house. In a twist to the standard eminent domain case, New London, Conn., wanted to acquire her land to then sell it to a private developer, which created a Supreme Court battle. In a controversial 5-4 decision, the liberal wing of the court, joined by Anthony Kennedy, ruled that taking private property and then selling it to private interests for economic redevelopment was indeed a constitutional use of the government's eminent domain power. 20 Conservatives went nuts. They made a fucking movie about this lady and her stupid house. Parts of the house were moved and \"rededicated\" at a new site, and it's now some kind of monument to the fight against big government overreach. 21 Reluctantly, I agree with the Republicans about this issue. Clarence Thomas, in dissent in Kelo , said that the majority was converting the \"public use\" allowed by the Fifth Amendment into any vague promise of a \"public purpose.\" And, God help me, I think Thomas was right about that. The government should not use its powers of eminent domain to essentially acquire land on the cheap for business interests, just because those businesses promise that there will be some public purpose behind their profit motive. For instance, I don't think the government should be involved in acquiring land to build sports arenas that will be owned by wealthy team owners and used to pump the valuation of their sports franchises into the billions. 22 My problem with Kelo is that centering this issue on a white homeowner and the legal distinction between public \"use\" versus \"purpose\" ignores entire Black and brown communities that have been wiped off the damn map by the government's use of eminent domain. Where's the movie about Seneca Village? Where's the movie about the Black and Latino renters who get crushed every time the local team wants a new stadium? Where's the movie about all the people and communities who were destroyed by former New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses? 23 Yeah, if we're going to talk about eminent domain, we're going to talk about how many of our roads, highways, and beaches were figuratively built on top of the bones of Black and brown people who used to live there. I'm sorry, I just can't get up for this lawyer fight between public use and public purpose, when the government's definition of public use is so often merely \"playthings for white people,\" as if that's an acceptable constitutional definition of the term. 24 \"Little pink house\": Susette Kelo stands outside her home, which became a symbol in 2005 of the abuse of eminent domain. (Spencer Platt / Getty Images) T he first time I heard about eminent domain was in college, where I read Robert Caro's seminal book The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York . Moses is responsible for so much of the way modern cities look and feel, and not just in New York, because his methods were imported and copied throughout the country. Moses was a destroyer of Black and brown communities. And eminent domain is what allowed that asshole to be racist at an industrial scale. 25 If I may summarize one of the greatest modern biographies ever written in two sentences: Robert Moses was a deeply racist man who built highways, bridges, parks, beaches, and even housing projects by bulldozing the hopes, dreams, and often homes of people in his way. His main tactic for acquiring land for his projects was identifying vulnerable minority or immigrant communities, declaring their homes and land \"blighted,\" and then using the government's power of eminent domain to evict people from their homes over their objections and for a fraction of what their communities were actually worth. 26 Declaring a community \"blighted\" or a home \"condemned\" is a favorite trick of the government when it wants to avoid paying just compensation for the land it takes. It's what Moses did, repeatedly, throughout New York City in the 1930s, '40s, '50s, and into the '60s. Moses would target a community, have state assessors declare it a \"slum,\" and acquire the land through eminent domain at cut-rate prices. And it's a method many cities and states would copy under the guise of \"urban renewal.\" 27 Urban renewal laws authorize the state to seize land it has designated blighted and deteriorated in some way. The New York State urban renewal law is codified in Article 15 of New York Consolidated Laws, Section 500. Look at how the law describes the purpose of the policy in Section 501: 28 There exist in many municipalities within this state residential, non-residential, commercial, industrial or vacant areas, and combinations thereof, which are slum or blighted, or which are becoming slum or blighted areas because of substandard, insanitary, deteriorated or deteriorating conditions, factors, and characteristics, with or without tangible physical blight. The existence of such areas constitutes a serious and growing menace, is injurious to the public safety, health, morals and welfare, contributes increasingly to the spread of crime, juvenile delinquency and disease, necessitates excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for all forms of public service and constitutes a negative influence on adjacent properties impairing their economic soundness and stability, thereby threatening the source of public revenues. 29 Moses's domain: Robert Moses studies a map in 1958. (AP) As Yoda might say, \"Mudhole? Slimy? My home, this is.\" Clearing out \"the slums\" and replacing run-down and dilapidated-looking buildings with fresh, shiny, economically productive buildings and infrastructure sounds like a great plan, unless you are the person being cleared out.

Neither the property nor the residency requirements applied to white men. Seneca Village was a way for some Black men to meet that property requirement. Of the 100 Black people eligible to vote in New York State in 1845, 10 lived in Seneca Village. Five years later, in 1850, of the 71 Black property owners in New York City, 20 percent lived in Seneca Village. 4 By 1857, however, the entire area had been razed to the ground. The homes and churches were demolished, and the people were scattered. Seneca Village did not fall to some natural disaster, or even the ubiquitous mob of angry whites that shows up, again and again, throughout American history to lynch Black people who seem to be getting ahead. No, Seneca Village was destroyed because in 1853 New York passed a law allowing for the construction of Central Park. 5 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Map of Seneca Village.

If the state needs your land for some public purpose, and you can't raise an army to oppose the state, your land is forfeited. Living in a state that is willing to pay for the private land it needs to take is just a modern invention for property owners who would otherwise get screwed if they happen to live on land the state needs. Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius, whose On the Law of War and Peace from 1625 is one of the first real texts of international law, wrote: \"The property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the state.... But when this is done the state is bound to make good the loss to those who lose their property.\" That's the nice way of saying: \"There wouldn't be a West India Company without these fortifications, but here, take some money and go.\" The Dutch didn't really \"own\" Manhattan in 1626, because they couldn't defend Manhattan in 1626. Indeed, Wall Street is so named because there used to be a defensive freaking wall there. The wall was built by slaves the Dutch also \"bought\" and brought with them to defend the settlement of New Amsterdam from attacks by the Indigenous Americans, the British, or pirates. 13 Now, I would love to tell you what James Madison, author of the Fifth Amendment, meant by \"just compensation.\" But I can't. I can't even tell you why eminent domain is tacked onto this amendment and not some other. I can tell you that Madison's initial proposed language was: \"No person shall be...obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without just compensation.\" Congress changed it to its final version, but I can't tell you why. No record of whatever debate may have occurred exists. No Federalist Paper focuses on this particular topic. 14 What I can tell you is that when white people want your shit, they will take it, and Black people will rarely be justly compensated for the destruction of their wealth. 15 Marking the spot: A protest on Juneteenth in 2020 ended with a gathering at the site where Seneca Village once stood. gathering at the site where Seneca Village once stood. (Frank Franklin II / AP) F ighting against eminent domain has become a bit of a cause célèbre for libertarian forces on the right. They've even given it one of their cool, right-wing names, so that their entire objection can fit on the bumper sticker on somebody's truck. They call eminent domain actions \"takings.\" Get it? The government is \"taking\" your stuff; who could support that, right? 16 Much of the heat on the right is over what constitutes a taking at all. Eminent domain certainly refers to physical takings: You had some land and now you don't. But arguably, eminent domain should also come into play when the government dictates how you are allowed to use your property. These instances are called \"regulatory takings,\" and they happen when, say, the government declares your private property a national historic site and thus prevents you from demolishing it and building a CVS. How much compensation is the government required to give out then? 17 Another large area of contention happens when the government takes only part of your property. Let's say that the government wants to place a few wind turbines on part of your land. The private property owner can still live there, so is it a taking at all? What if the wind turbines are super noisy? What if they \"cause cancer\"? (Author's note: They don't.) What if they're really quiet but super ugly? What is the just compensation for ruining your view? 18 If you know anything about Republicans, you understand why the right-wingers get up for this fight, and you can see why liberals are generally on the side of the government when it comes to eminent domain. We need things like wind turbines and historic sites much more than we need libertarians bitching and moaning about whether they received enough of a vig from the government for their troubles. 19 If I were a Republican, I would spend the next 30 minutes of your life telling you about a 2005 case called Kelo v. City of New London . Conservatives complain about this case more than Pharaoh complained about Yahweh. The case is about a white lady, Susette Kelo, who didn't want to sell her pink house. In a twist to the standard eminent domain case, New London, Conn., wanted to acquire her land to then sell it to a private developer, which created a Supreme Court battle. In a controversial 5-4 decision, the liberal wing of the court, joined by Anthony Kennedy, ruled that taking private property and then selling it to private interests for economic redevelopment was indeed a constitutional use of the government's eminent domain power. 20 Conservatives went nuts. They made a fucking movie about this lady and her stupid house. Parts of the house were moved and \"rededicated\" at a new site, and it's now some kind of monument to the fight against big government overreach. 21 Reluctantly, I agree with the Republicans about this issue. Clarence Thomas, in dissent in Kelo , said that the majority was converting the \"public use\" allowed by the Fifth Amendment into any vague promise of a \"public purpose.\" And, God help me, I think Thomas was right about that. The government should not use its powers of eminent domain to essentially acquire land on the cheap for business interests, just because those businesses promise that there will be some public purpose behind their profit motive. For instance, I don't think the government should be involved in acquiring land to build sports arenas that will be owned by wealthy team owners and used to pump the valuation of their sports franchises into the billions. 22 My problem with Kelo is that centering this issue on a white homeowner and the legal distinction between public \"use\" versus \"purpose\" ignores entire Black and brown communities that have been wiped off the damn map by the government's use of eminent domain. Where's the movie about Seneca Village? Where's the movie about the Black and Latino renters who get crushed every time the local team wants a new stadium? Where's the movie about all the people and communities who were destroyed by former New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses? 23 Yeah, if we're going to talk about eminent domain, we're going to talk about how many of our roads, highways, and beaches were figuratively built on top of the bones of Black and brown people who used to live there. I'm sorry, I just can't get up for this lawyer fight between public use and public purpose, when the government's definition of public use is so often merely \"playthings for white people,\" as if that's an acceptable constitutional definition of the term. 24 \"Little pink house\": Susette Kelo stands outside her home, which became a symbol in 2005 of the abuse of eminent domain. (Spencer Platt / Getty Images) T he first time I heard about eminent domain was in college, where I read Robert Caro's seminal book The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York . Moses is responsible for so much of the way modern cities look and feel, and not just in New York, because his methods were imported and copied throughout the country. Moses was a destroyer of Black and brown communities. And eminent domain is what allowed that asshole to be racist at an industrial scale. 25 If I may summarize one of the greatest modern biographies ever written in two sentences: Robert Moses was a deeply racist man who built highways, bridges, parks, beaches, and even housing projects by bulldozing the hopes, dreams, and often homes of people in his way. His main tactic for acquiring land for his projects was identifying vulnerable minority or immigrant communities, declaring their homes and land \"blighted,\" and then using the government's power of eminent domain to evict people from their homes over their objections and for a fraction of what their communities were actually worth. 26 Declaring a community \"blighted\" or a home \"condemned\" is a favorite trick of the government when it wants to avoid paying just compensation for the land it takes. It's what Moses did, repeatedly, throughout New York City in the 1930s, '40s, '50s, and into the '60s. Moses would target a community, have state assessors declare it a \"slum,\" and acquire the land through eminent domain at cut-rate prices. And it's a method many cities and states would copy under the guise of \"urban renewal.\" 27 Urban renewal laws authorize the state to seize land it has designated blighted and deteriorated in some way. The New York State urban renewal law is codified in Article 15 of New York Consolidated Laws, Section 500. Look at how the law describes the purpose of the policy in Section 501: 28 There exist in many municipalities within this state residential, non-residential, commercial, industrial or vacant areas, and combinations thereof, which are slum or blighted, or which are becoming slum or blighted areas because of substandard, insanitary, deteriorated or deteriorating conditions, factors, and characteristics, with or without tangible physical blight. The existence of such areas constitutes a serious and growing menace, is injurious to the public safety, health, morals and welfare, contributes increasingly to the spread of crime, juvenile delinquency and disease, necessitates excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for all forms of public service and constitutes a negative influence on adjacent properties impairing their economic soundness and stability, thereby threatening the source of public revenues. 29 Moses's domain: Robert Moses studies a map in 1958. (AP) As Yoda might say, \"Mudhole? Slimy? My home, this is.\" Clearing out \"the slums\" and replacing run-down and dilapidated-looking buildings with fresh, shiny, economically productive buildings and infrastructure sounds like a great plan, unless you are the person being cleared out. Then, not only are you being displaced from your community, your \"just compensation\" becomes slum prices, leaving you only enough money to go and try to find a different slum to live in. The government usually doesn't pay people in so-called blighted communities what their homes are worth, and never pays them what the land will be worth after all the happy-clappy urban renewal takes place. 30 This is why eminent domain so often takes advantage of vulnerable people and communities. The government doesn't actually want to pay a fair price for the land and doesn't want to fight legal battles against well-connected and powerful communities who can protect their property and interests in court. 31 \"Condemnation\" is what happened to Susette Kelo's property, before the government took it. 32 The remains of San Juan Hill , the neighborhood Robert Moses erased to make way for Lincoln Center, seen rising in the background. (Archive Photos / Getty Images) B ut again, this tactic didn't just start happening in 2005, and to white people. We can go all the way back to the creation of Central Park a century and a half earlier and find the same tactics at play. An enormous park measuring 775 acres (today the park is actually 843 acres) in the middle of the island was not actually the first plan for an open green space in New York City. The first suggested site was a parcel of land, about 150 acres, along the East River between what is now 66th Street and 75th Street, known as Jones's Wood. In 1851, the New York State Assembly and Senate both passed resolutions to take the Jones's Wood property through eminent domain. It was happening. 33 More from Mystal The Many Remarkable Black Women Who Could Replace Stephen Breyer Elie Mystal Clarence and Ginni Thomas, the Supreme Court's Unethical \"It\" Couple Elie Mystal But the wealthy white landowners-John Jones's heirs, and another wealthy New York family, the Schermerhorns, whose property was included in some of the proposals for the park-didn't want to sell the land. Understand, neither the Joneses nor the Schermerhorns lived on the property full-time; this was the 1850s, and the Upper East Side might as well have been a Mars colony. The Joneses' and the Schermerhorns' primary residences were downtown, where any self-respecting wealthy New Yorker would live. These people just didn't want to sell their undeveloped \"country\" estates uptown to the city for a public works project. So the families sued New York State to block the state's taking of their land. 34 Did I mention that the Joneses and the Schermerhorns were white? They were white. And since they were white, all of the stuff I said earlier about the foundational principles of state sovereignty that eminent domain rests on, all of the stuff I said about how, legally speaking, the concept of eminent domain is so ingrained in the very conception of property that you scarcely need constitutional language acknowledging it, all of that stuff comes with the caveat of \"unless you are wealthy and white.\" 35 Of course, the Joneses and the Schermerhorns won their lawsuit against the state. Of course they did. A court ruled that the state resolution to acquire the property through eminent domain violated the due process rights of rich white people. Apparently the resolution allowed the state to back out of the deal but didn't allow the Joneses and the Schermerhorns the same right. I'd point out that of course the Joneses and the Schermerhorns had no right to \"back out\" of the deal, because the state was using its unquestionable sovereign power to force the families into taking the \"deal\" whether they liked it or not, but now I'm just shaking my fist at white judges who have been dead for 150 years. 36 And so, instead of displacing two white families who didn't even use their land as their primary residence, the city went forward with a new plan that included displacing over 200 Black people in Seneca Village who had built up an independent Black community on some of the only land they were allowed to purchase. All of the tricks that would later be deployed against Black communities in the 20th century were used against the people of Seneca Village in the 19th century. The newspapers called their land a \"swamp.\" The media called the people living there \"squatters\" (even though, again, 20 percent of the Black homeowners in all of New York City lived there), and, of course, the papers referred to their community as a \"n***er village.\" 37 The residents of Seneca Village also went to court to object to the government taking their land, but unlike the wealthy white families, they lost in court every time. The landowners were paid an average of $700 per lot. Andrew Williams, that shoe shiner turned landowner who bought the first lots from the Whiteheads, was paid $2,335 for his three lots and house, even though he initially asked for $3,500 in \"just compensation.\" Even when taking his land and destroying the community he helped to found, the state couldn't be bothered to pay the man what he asked for. 38 The Time Warner Center is a relatively recent construction that sits right at the southwestern entrance to Central Park. It sits on about two acres of land and is valued at approximately $1.5 billion. 39 New York City should go and find all the descendants of Seneca Village and pay them what their land is actually worth. I bet the government would be more cautious and fair when using its power of eminent domain if the compensation were ever just. 40\n\nSeneca Village was a home of political power for Black people as well. Remember, in 1855 there were no 14th or 15th Amendments. There was no guaranteed right to vote for African Americans, even free ones living in the North. To be eligible to vote in New York State in the 1850s, a Black man needed to be a male landowner in possession of $250 worth of property and have state residency for three years. Neither the property nor the residency requirements applied to white men. Seneca Village was a way for some Black men to meet that property requirement. Of the 100 Black people eligible to vote in New York State in 1845, 10 lived in Seneca Village. Five years later, in 1850, of the 71 Black property owners in New York City, 20 percent lived in Seneca Village. 4 By 1857, however, the entire area had been razed to the ground. The homes and churches were demolished, and the people were scattered. Seneca Village did not fall to some natural disaster, or even the ubiquitous mob of angry whites that shows up, again and again, throughout American history to lynch Black people who seem to be getting ahead. No, Seneca Village was destroyed because in 1853 New York passed a law allowing for the construction of Central Park. 5 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Map of Seneca Village. (Courtesy of NYC Municipal Archives) Lost neighbors: Residents of Seneca Village, a thriving Black community that was razed to the ground to make way for Central Park. S eneca Village was located in what is now thought of as the west side of Central Park. Its boundaries extended from about 82nd Street to 89th Street, between what is now Central Park West and where Seventh Avenue would be if it extended straight through the park. Seneca Village was a small and arguably unnecessary part of the 775 acres of land set aside by the legislature to create the park. 6 The government had the authority to buy or \"take\" the land for Central Park under the doctrine of eminent domain, which is enshrined in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Eminent domain is the theory that all land, even private property, can be acquired by the government if it is in the public interest. The relevant part of the Fifth Amendment reads: 7 Current Issue View our current issue No person shall be...deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. 8 Eminent domain is such a core concept of sovereignty that the US Supreme Court has said that it doesn't even require a constitutional provision. But compensation for exercising that inherent sovereign authority does require some constitutional language. 9 To understand eminent domain, you have to appreciate that, if you start from first principles, all land is \"public.\" All land is just there, claimed only by whoever or whatever happens to be standing on it, and can physically defend it, at a particular time. It's all God's land, if you're into that sort of thing. Or the king's land, if you lived in pretty much any pre-Enlightenment society. 10 Pillars of the community: Albro Lyons and Mary Joseph Marshall, noted abolitionists, owned plots of land in Seneca Village. \"Private\" property has surely always existed in some form-I'm certain that some of the ancient art we've uncovered and put in our museums was actually early modern \"Beware of Bear\" signs fashioned by cavemen who were sick of being solicited at their homes. But as a standing inalienable legal concept, fully private property that rulers are not allowed to violate at will is new (in geologic time) and kind of weird. Entire philosophical tracts on government (including the only one most people have ever heard of: John Locke's second treatise on government) have been written to explain, more or less, why private property should exist at all. Private property is not the natural or inevitable result of settled society. 11 Different legal systems treat the concept of private ownership differently. Take, for instance, the initial \"purchase\" of Manhattan Island by the Dutch . In 1626 Peter Minuit, director of New Netherland, reported that he bought Manhattan for 60 guilders (about $24, according to 19th-century historians). It would be too glib and easy to say that the Indigenous people who sold him the land didn't understand private property. As Arizona State law professor Robert Miller makes clear, they likely did have a fully functional concept of property \"exclusivity.\" But we would probably call the land deal a \"lease,\" not a \"purchase.\" In his book Law in American History , University of Virginia law professor G. Edward White makes the case that the Native Lenape were \"not relinquishing the island, but simply welcoming the Dutch as additional occupants.\" It was the colonizers who didn't understand or respect the deal. 12 Unlike private property, eminent domain does flow naturally and inevitably from the concept that ownership exists only insofar as the state is able to secure and defend the territory. If the state needs your land for some public purpose, and you can't raise an army to oppose the state, your land is forfeited. Living in a state that is willing to pay for the private land it needs to take is just a modern invention for property owners who would otherwise get screwed if they happen to live on land the state needs.

The newspapers called their land a \"swamp.\" The media called the people living there \"squatters\" (even though, again, 20 percent of the Black homeowners in all of New York City lived there), and, of course, the papers referred to their community as a \"n***er village.\" 37 The residents of Seneca Village also went to court to object to the government taking their land, but unlike the wealthy white families, they lost in court every time. The landowners were paid an average of $700 per lot. Andrew Williams, that shoe shiner turned landowner who bought the first lots from the Whiteheads, was paid $2,335 for his three lots and house, even though he initially asked for $3,500 in \"just compensation.\" Even when taking his land and destroying the community he helped to found, the state couldn't be bothered to pay the man what he asked for. 38 The Time Warner Center is a relatively recent construction that sits right at the southwestern entrance to Central Park. It sits on about two acres of land and is valued at approximately $1.5 billion. 39 New York City should go and find all the descendants of Seneca Village and pay them what their land is actually worth. I bet the government would be more cautious and fair when using its power of eminent domain if the compensation were ever just. 40\n\nBy 1857, however, the entire area had been razed to the ground. The homes and churches were demolished, and the people were scattered. Seneca Village did not fall to some natural disaster, or even the ubiquitous mob of angry whites that shows up, again and again, throughout American history to lynch Black people who seem to be getting ahead. No, Seneca Village was destroyed because in 1853 New York passed a law allowing for the construction of Central Park. 5 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Map of Seneca Village. (Courtesy of NYC Municipal Archives) Lost neighbors: Residents of Seneca Village, a thriving Black community that was razed to the ground to make way for Central Park. S eneca Village was located in what is now thought of as the west side of Central Park. Its boundaries extended from about 82nd Street to 89th Street, between what is now Central Park West and where Seventh Avenue would be if it extended straight through the park. Seneca Village was a small and arguably unnecessary part of the 775 acres of land set aside by the legislature to create the park. 6 The government had the authority to buy or \"take\" the land for Central Park under the doctrine of eminent domain, which is enshrined in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Eminent domain is the theory that all land, even private property, can be acquired by the government if it is in the public interest. The relevant part of the Fifth Amendment reads: 7 Current Issue View our current issue No person shall be...deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. 8 Eminent domain is such a core concept of sovereignty that the US Supreme Court has said that it doesn't even require a constitutional provision. But compensation for exercising that inherent sovereign authority does require some constitutional language. 9 To understand eminent domain, you have to appreciate that, if you start from first principles, all land is \"public.\" All land is just there, claimed only by whoever or whatever happens to be standing on it, and can physically defend it, at a particular time. It's all God's land, if you're into that sort of thing. Or the king's land, if you lived in pretty much any pre-Enlightenment society. 10 Pillars of the community: Albro Lyons and Mary Joseph Marshall, noted abolitionists, owned plots of land in Seneca Village. \"Private\" property has surely always existed in some form-I'm certain that some of the ancient art we've uncovered and put in our museums was actually early modern \"Beware of Bear\" signs fashioned by cavemen who were sick of being solicited at their homes. But as a standing inalienable legal concept, fully private property that rulers are not allowed to violate at will is new (in geologic time) and kind of weird. Entire philosophical tracts on government (including the only one most people have ever heard of: John Locke's second treatise on government) have been written to explain, more or less, why private property should exist at all. Private property is not the natural or inevitable result of settled society. 11 Different legal systems treat the concept of private ownership differently. Take, for instance, the initial \"purchase\" of Manhattan Island by the Dutch . In 1626 Peter Minuit, director of New Netherland, reported that he bought Manhattan for 60 guilders (about $24, according to 19th-century historians). It would be too glib and easy to say that the Indigenous people who sold him the land didn't understand private property. As Arizona State law professor Robert Miller makes clear, they likely did have a fully functional concept of property \"exclusivity.\" But we would probably call the land deal a \"lease,\" not a \"purchase.\" In his book Law in American History , University of Virginia law professor G. Edward White makes the case that the Native Lenape were \"not relinquishing the island, but simply welcoming the Dutch as additional occupants.\" It was the colonizers who didn't understand or respect the deal. 12 Unlike private property, eminent domain does flow naturally and inevitably from the concept that ownership exists only insofar as the state is able to secure and defend the territory. If the state needs your land for some public purpose, and you can't raise an army to oppose the state, your land is forfeited. Living in a state that is willing to pay for the private land it needs to take is just a modern invention for property owners who would otherwise get screwed if they happen to live on land the state needs. Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius, whose On the Law of War and Peace from 1625 is one of the first real texts of international law, wrote: \"The property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the state.... But when this is done the state is bound to make good the loss to those who lose their property.\" That's the nice way of saying: \"There wouldn't be a West India Company without these fortifications, but here, take some money and go.\" The Dutch didn't really \"own\" Manhattan in 1626, because they couldn't defend Manhattan in 1626. Indeed, Wall Street is so named because there used to be a defensive freaking wall there. The wall was built by slaves the Dutch also \"bought\" and brought with them to defend the settlement of New Amsterdam from attacks by the Indigenous Americans, the British, or pirates. 13 Now, I would love to tell you what James Madison, author of the Fifth Amendment, meant by \"just compensation.\" But I can't. I can't even tell you why eminent domain is tacked onto this amendment and not some other. I can tell you that Madison's initial proposed language was: \"No person shall be...obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without just compensation.\" Congress changed it to its final version, but I can't tell you why. No record of whatever debate may have occurred exists. No Federalist Paper focuses on this particular topic. 14 What I can tell you is that when white people want your shit, they will take it, and Black people will rarely be justly compensated for the destruction of their wealth. 15 Marking the spot: A protest on Juneteenth in 2020 ended with a gathering at the site where Seneca Village once stood. gathering at the site where Seneca Village once stood. (Frank Franklin II / AP) F ighting against eminent domain has become a bit of a cause célèbre for libertarian forces on the right. They've even given it one of their cool, right-wing names, so that their entire objection can fit on the bumper sticker on somebody's truck. They call eminent domain actions \"takings.\" Get it? The government is \"taking\" your stuff; who could support that, right? 16 Much of the heat on the right is over what constitutes a taking at all. Eminent domain certainly refers to physical takings: You had some land and now you don't. But arguably, eminent domain should also come into play when the government dictates how you are allowed to use your property. These instances are called \"regulatory takings,\" and they happen when, say, the government declares your private property a national historic site and thus prevents you from demolishing it and building a CVS. How much compensation is the government required to give out then? 17 Another large area of contention happens when the government takes only part of your property. Let's say that the government wants to place a few wind turbines on part of your land. The private property owner can still live there, so is it a taking at all? What if the wind turbines are super noisy? What if they \"cause cancer\"? (Author's note: They don't.) What if they're really quiet but super ugly? What is the just compensation for ruining your view? 18 If you know anything about Republicans, you understand why the right-wingers get up for this fight, and you can see why liberals are generally on the side of the government when it comes to eminent domain. We need things like wind turbines and historic sites much more than we need libertarians bitching and moaning about whether they received enough of a vig from the government for their troubles. 19 If I were a Republican, I would spend the next 30 minutes of your life telling you about a 2005 case called Kelo v. City of New London . Conservatives complain about this case more than Pharaoh complained about Yahweh. The case is about a white lady, Susette Kelo, who didn't want to sell her pink house. In a twist to the standard eminent domain case, New London, Conn., wanted to acquire her land to then sell it to a private developer, which created a Supreme Court battle. In a controversial 5-4 decision, the liberal wing of the court, joined by Anthony Kennedy, ruled that taking private property and then selling it to private interests for economic redevelopment was indeed a constitutional use of the government's eminent domain power. 20 Conservatives went nuts. They made a fucking movie about this lady and her stupid house. Parts of the house were moved and \"rededicated\" at a new site, and it's now some kind of monument to the fight against big government overreach. 21 Reluctantly, I agree with the Republicans about this issue. Clarence Thomas, in dissent in Kelo , said that the majority was converting the \"public use\" allowed by the Fifth Amendment into any vague promise of a \"public purpose.\" And, God help me, I think Thomas was right about that. The government should not use its powers of eminent domain to essentially acquire land on the cheap for business interests, just because those businesses promise that there will be some public purpose behind their profit motive. For instance, I don't think the government should be involved in acquiring land to build sports arenas that will be owned by wealthy team owners and used to pump the valuation of their sports franchises into the billions. 22 My problem with Kelo is that centering this issue on a white homeowner and the legal distinction between public \"use\" versus \"purpose\" ignores entire Black and brown communities that have been wiped off the damn map by the government's use of eminent domain. Where's the movie about Seneca Village? Where's the movie about the Black and Latino renters who get crushed every time the local team wants a new stadium? Where's the movie about all the people and communities who were destroyed by former New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses? 23 Yeah, if we're going to talk about eminent domain, we're going to talk about how many of our roads, highways, and beaches were figuratively built on top of the bones of Black and brown people who used to live there. I'm sorry, I just can't get up for this lawyer fight between public use and public purpose, when the government's definition of public use is so often merely \"playthings for white people,\" as if that's an acceptable constitutional definition of the term. 24 \"Little pink house\": Susette Kelo stands outside her home, which became a symbol in 2005 of the abuse of eminent domain. (Spencer Platt / Getty Images) T he first time I heard about eminent domain was in college, where I read Robert Caro's seminal book The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York . Moses is responsible for so much of the way modern cities look and feel, and not just in New York, because his methods were imported and copied throughout the country. Moses was a destroyer of Black and brown communities. And eminent domain is what allowed that asshole to be racist at an industrial scale. 25 If I may summarize one of the greatest modern biographies ever written in two sentences: Robert Moses was a deeply racist man who built highways, bridges, parks, beaches, and even housing projects by bulldozing the hopes, dreams, and often homes of people in his way. His main tactic for acquiring land for his projects was identifying vulnerable minority or immigrant communities, declaring their homes and land \"blighted,\" and then using the government's power of eminent domain to evict people from their homes over their objections and for a fraction of what their communities were actually worth. 26 Declaring a community \"blighted\" or a home \"condemned\" is a favorite trick of the government when it wants to avoid paying just compensation for the land it takes. It's what Moses did, repeatedly, throughout New York City in the 1930s, '40s, '50s, and into the '60s. Moses would target a community, have state assessors declare it a \"slum,\" and acquire the land through eminent domain at cut-rate prices. And it's a method many cities and states would copy under the guise of \"urban renewal.\" 27 Urban renewal laws authorize the state to seize land it has designated blighted and deteriorated in some way. The New York State urban renewal law is codified in Article 15 of New York Consolidated Laws, Section 500. Look at how the law describes the purpose of the policy in Section 501: 28 There exist in many municipalities within this state residential, non-residential, commercial, industrial or vacant areas, and combinations thereof, which are slum or blighted, or which are becoming slum or blighted areas because of substandard, insanitary, deteriorated or deteriorating conditions, factors, and characteristics, with or without tangible physical blight. The existence of such areas constitutes a serious and growing menace, is injurious to the public safety, health, morals and welfare, contributes increasingly to the spread of crime, juvenile delinquency and disease, necessitates excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for all forms of public service and constitutes a negative influence on adjacent properties impairing their economic soundness and stability, thereby threatening the source of public revenues. 29 Moses's domain: Robert Moses studies a map in 1958. (AP) As Yoda might say, \"Mudhole? Slimy? My home, this is.\" Clearing out \"the slums\" and replacing run-down and dilapidated-looking buildings with fresh, shiny, economically productive buildings and infrastructure sounds like a great plan, unless you are the person being cleared out. Then, not only are you being displaced from your community, your \"just compensation\" becomes slum prices, leaving you only enough money to go and try to find a different slum to live in. The government usually doesn't pay people in so-called blighted communities what their homes are worth, and never pays them what the land will be worth after all the happy-clappy urban renewal takes place. 30 This is why eminent domain so often takes advantage of vulnerable people and communities. The government doesn't actually want to pay a fair price for the land and doesn't want to fight legal battles against well-connected and powerful communities who can protect their property and interests in court. 31 \"Condemnation\" is what happened to Susette Kelo's property, before the government took it. 32 The remains of San Juan Hill , the neighborhood Robert Moses erased to make way for Lincoln Center, seen rising in the background. (Archive Photos / Getty Images) B ut again, this tactic didn't just start happening in 2005, and to white people. We can go all the way back to the creation of Central Park a century and a half earlier and find the same tactics at play. An enormous park measuring 775 acres (today the park is actually 843 acres) in the middle of the island was not actually the first plan for an open green space in New York City. The first suggested site was a parcel of land, about 150 acres, along the East River between what is now 66th Street and 75th Street, known as Jones's Wood. In 1851, the New York State Assembly and Senate both passed resolutions to take the Jones's Wood property through eminent domain. It was happening. 33 More from Mystal The Many Remarkable Black Women Who Could Replace Stephen Breyer Elie Mystal Clarence and Ginni Thomas, the Supreme Court's Unethical \"It\" Couple Elie Mystal But the wealthy white landowners-John Jones's heirs, and another wealthy New York family, the Schermerhorns, whose property was included in some of the proposals for the park-didn't want to sell the land. Understand, neither the Joneses nor the Schermerhorns lived on the property full-time; this was the 1850s, and the Upper East Side might as well have been a Mars colony. The Joneses' and the Schermerhorns' primary residences were downtown, where any self-respecting wealthy New Yorker would live. These people just didn't want to sell their undeveloped \"country\" estates uptown to the city for a public works project. So the families sued New York State to block the state's taking of their land. 34 Did I mention that the Joneses and the Schermerhorns were white? They were white. And since they were white, all of the stuff I said earlier about the foundational principles of state sovereignty that eminent domain rests on, all of the stuff I said about how, legally speaking, the concept of eminent domain is so ingrained in the very conception of property that you scarcely need constitutional language acknowledging it, all of that stuff comes with the caveat of \"unless you are wealthy and white.\" 35 Of course, the Joneses and the Schermerhorns won their lawsuit against the state. Of course they did. A court ruled that the state resolution to acquire the property through eminent domain violated the due process rights of rich white people. Apparently the resolution allowed the state to back out of the deal but didn't allow the Joneses and the Schermerhorns the same right. I'd point out that of course the Joneses and the Schermerhorns had no right to \"back out\" of the deal, because the state was using its unquestionable sovereign power to force the families into taking the \"deal\" whether they liked it or not, but now I'm just shaking my fist at white judges who have been dead for 150 years. 36 And so, instead of displacing two white families who didn't even use their land as their primary residence, the city went forward with a new plan that included displacing over 200 Black people in Seneca Village who had built up an independent Black community on some of the only land they were allowed to purchase.

My home, this is.\" Clearing out \"the slums\" and replacing run-down and dilapidated-looking buildings with fresh, shiny, economically productive buildings and infrastructure sounds like a great plan, unless you are the person being cleared out. Then, not only are you being displaced from your community, your \"just compensation\" becomes slum prices, leaving you only enough money to go and try to find a different slum to live in. The government usually doesn't pay people in so-called blighted communities what their homes are worth, and never pays them what the land will be worth after all the happy-clappy urban renewal takes place. 30 This is why eminent domain so often takes advantage of vulnerable people and communities. The government doesn't actually want to pay a fair price for the land and doesn't want to fight legal battles against well-connected and powerful communities who can protect their property and interests in court. 31 \"Condemnation\" is what happened to Susette Kelo's property, before the government took it. 32 The remains of San Juan Hill , the neighborhood Robert Moses erased to make way for Lincoln Center, seen rising in the background. (Archive Photos / Getty Images) B ut again, this tactic didn't just start happening in 2005, and to white people. We can go all the way back to the creation of Central Park a century and a half earlier and find the same tactics at play. An enormous park measuring 775 acres (today the park is actually 843 acres) in the middle of the island was not actually the first plan for an open green space in New York City. The first suggested site was a parcel of land, about 150 acres, along the East River between what is now 66th Street and 75th Street, known as Jones's Wood. In 1851, the New York State Assembly and Senate both passed resolutions to take the Jones's Wood property through eminent domain. It was happening. 33 More from Mystal The Many Remarkable Black Women Who Could Replace Stephen Breyer Elie Mystal Clarence and Ginni Thomas, the Supreme Court's Unethical \"It\" Couple Elie Mystal But the wealthy white landowners-John Jones's heirs, and another wealthy New York family, the Schermerhorns, whose property was included in some of the proposals for the park-didn't want to sell the land. Understand, neither the Joneses nor the Schermerhorns lived on the property full-time; this was the 1850s, and the Upper East Side might as well have been a Mars colony. The Joneses' and the Schermerhorns' primary residences were downtown, where any self-respecting wealthy New Yorker would live. These people just didn't want to sell their undeveloped \"country\" estates uptown to the city for a public works project. So the families sued New York State to block the state's taking of their land. 34 Did I mention that the Joneses and the Schermerhorns were white? They were white. And since they were white, all of the stuff I said earlier about the foundational principles of state sovereignty that eminent domain rests on, all of the stuff I said about how, legally speaking, the concept of eminent domain is so ingrained in the very conception of property that you scarcely need constitutional language acknowledging it, all of that stuff comes with the caveat of \"unless you are wealthy and white.\" 35 Of course, the Joneses and the Schermerhorns won their lawsuit against the state. Of course they did. A court ruled that the state resolution to acquire the property through eminent domain violated the due process rights of rich white people. Apparently the resolution allowed the state to back out of the deal but didn't allow the Joneses and the Schermerhorns the same right. I'd point out that of course the Joneses and the Schermerhorns had no right to \"back out\" of the deal, because the state was using its unquestionable sovereign power to force the families into taking the \"deal\" whether they liked it or not, but now I'm just shaking my fist at white judges who have been dead for 150 years. 36 And so, instead of displacing two white families who didn't even use their land as their primary residence, the city went forward with a new plan that included displacing over 200 Black people in Seneca Village who had built up an independent Black community on some of the only land they were allowed to purchase. All of the tricks that would later be deployed against Black communities in the 20th century were used against the people of Seneca Village in the 19th century. The newspapers called their land a \"swamp.\" The media called the people living there \"squatters\" (even though, again, 20 percent of the Black homeowners in all of New York City lived there), and, of course, the papers referred to their community as a \"n***er village.\" 37 The residents of Seneca Village also went to court to object to the government taking their land, but unlike the wealthy white families, they lost in court every time. The landowners were paid an average of $700 per lot. Andrew Williams, that shoe shiner turned landowner who bought the first lots from the Whiteheads, was paid $2,335 for his three lots and house, even though he initially asked for $3,500 in \"just compensation.\" Even when taking his land and destroying the community he helped to found, the state couldn't be bothered to pay the man what he asked for. 38 The Time Warner Center is a relatively recent construction that sits right at the southwestern entrance to Central Park. It sits on about two acres of land and is valued at approximately $1.5 billion. 39 New York City should go and find all the descendants of Seneca Village and pay them what their land is actually worth. I bet the government would be more cautious and fair when using its power of eminent domain if the compensation were ever just. 40\n\nThe government had the authority to buy or \"take\" the land for Central Park under the doctrine of eminent domain, which is enshrined in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Eminent domain is the theory that all land, even private property, can be acquired by the government if it is in the public interest. The relevant part of the Fifth Amendment reads: 7 Current Issue View our current issue No person shall be...deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation. 8 Eminent domain is such a core concept of sovereignty that the US Supreme Court has said that it doesn't even require a constitutional provision. But compensation for exercising that inherent sovereign authority does require some constitutional language. 9 To understand eminent domain, you have to appreciate that, if you start from first principles, all land is \"public.\" All land is just there, claimed only by whoever or whatever happens to be standing on it, and can physically defend it, at a particular time. It's all God's land, if you're into that sort of thing. Or the king's land, if you lived in pretty much any pre-Enlightenment society. 10 Pillars of the community: Albro Lyons and Mary Joseph Marshall, noted abolitionists, owned plots of land in Seneca Village. \"Private\" property has surely always existed in some form-I'm certain that some of the ancient art we've uncovered and put in our museums was actually early modern \"Beware of Bear\" signs fashioned by cavemen who were sick of being solicited at their homes. But as a standing inalienable legal concept, fully private property that rulers are not allowed to violate at will is new (in geologic time) and kind of weird. Entire philosophical tracts on government (including the only one most people have ever heard of: John Locke's second treatise on government) have been written to explain, more or less, why private property should exist at all. Private property is not the natural or inevitable result of settled society. 11 Different legal systems treat the concept of private ownership differently. Take, for instance, the initial \"purchase\" of Manhattan Island by the Dutch . In 1626 Peter Minuit, director of New Netherland, reported that he bought Manhattan for 60 guilders (about $24, according to 19th-century historians). It would be too glib and easy to say that the Indigenous people who sold him the land didn't understand private property. As Arizona State law professor Robert Miller makes clear, they likely did have a fully functional concept of property \"exclusivity.\" But we would probably call the land deal a \"lease,\" not a \"purchase.\" In his book Law in American History , University of Virginia law professor G. Edward White makes the case that the Native Lenape were \"not relinquishing the island, but simply welcoming the Dutch as additional occupants.\" It was the colonizers who didn't understand or respect the deal. 12 Unlike private property, eminent domain does flow naturally and inevitably from the concept that ownership exists only insofar as the state is able to secure and defend the territory. If the state needs your land for some public purpose, and you can't raise an army to oppose the state, your land is forfeited. Living in a state that is willing to pay for the private land it needs to take is just a modern invention for property owners who would otherwise get screwed if they happen to live on land the state needs. Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius, whose On the Law of War and Peace from 1625 is one of the first real texts of international law, wrote: \"The property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the state.... But when this is done the state is bound to make good the loss to those who lose their property.\" That's the nice way of saying: \"There wouldn't be a West India Company without these fortifications, but here, take some money and go.\" The Dutch didn't really \"own\" Manhattan in 1626, because they couldn't defend Manhattan in 1626. Indeed, Wall Street is so named because there used to be a defensive freaking wall there. The wall was built by slaves the Dutch also \"bought\" and brought with them to defend the settlement of New Amsterdam from attacks by the Indigenous Americans, the British, or pirates. 13 Now, I would love to tell you what James Madison, author of the Fifth Amendment, meant by \"just compensation.\" But I can't. I can't even tell you why eminent domain is tacked onto this amendment and not some other. I can tell you that Madison's initial proposed language was: \"No person shall be...obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without just compensation.\" Congress changed it to its final version, but I can't tell you why. No record of whatever debate may have occurred exists. No Federalist Paper focuses on this particular topic. 14 What I can tell you is that when white people want your shit, they will take it, and Black people will rarely be justly compensated for the destruction of their wealth. 15 Marking the spot: A protest on Juneteenth in 2020 ended with a gathering at the site where Seneca Village once stood. gathering at the site where Seneca Village once stood. (Frank Franklin II / AP) F ighting against eminent domain has become a bit of a cause célèbre for libertarian forces on the right. They've even given it one of their cool, right-wing names, so that their entire objection can fit on the bumper sticker on somebody's truck. They call eminent domain actions \"takings.\" Get it? The government is \"taking\" your stuff; who could support that, right? 16 Much of the heat on the right is over what constitutes a taking at all. Eminent domain certainly refers to physical takings: You had some land and now you don't. But arguably, eminent domain should also come into play when the government dictates how you are allowed to use your property. These instances are called \"regulatory takings,\" and they happen when, say, the government declares your private property a national historic site and thus prevents you from demolishing it and building a CVS. How much compensation is the government required to give out then? 17 Another large area of contention happens when the government takes only part of your property. Let's say that the government wants to place a few wind turbines on part of your land. The private property owner can still live there, so is it a taking at all? What if the wind turbines are super noisy? What if they \"cause cancer\"? (Author's note: They don't.) What if they're really quiet but super ugly? What is the just compensation for ruining your view? 18 If you know anything about Republicans, you understand why the right-wingers get up for this fight, and you can see why liberals are generally on the side of the government when it comes to eminent domain. We need things like wind turbines and historic sites much more than we need libertarians bitching and moaning about whether they received enough of a vig from the government for their troubles. 19 If I were a Republican, I would spend the next 30 minutes of your life telling you about a 2005 case called Kelo v. City of New London . Conservatives complain about this case more than Pharaoh complained about Yahweh. The case is about a white lady, Susette Kelo, who didn't want to sell her pink house. In a twist to the standard eminent domain case, New London, Conn., wanted to acquire her land to then sell it to a private developer, which created a Supreme Court battle. In a controversial 5-4 decision, the liberal wing of the court, joined by Anthony Kennedy, ruled that taking private property and then selling it to private interests for economic redevelopment was indeed a constitutional use of the government's eminent domain power. 20 Conservatives went nuts. They made a fucking movie about this lady and her stupid house. Parts of the house were moved and \"rededicated\" at a new site, and it's now some kind of monument to the fight against big government overreach. 21 Reluctantly, I agree with the Republicans about this issue. Clarence Thomas, in dissent in Kelo , said that the majority was converting the \"public use\" allowed by the Fifth Amendment into any vague promise of a \"public purpose.\" And, God help me, I think Thomas was right about that. The government should not use its powers of eminent domain to essentially acquire land on the cheap for business interests, just because those businesses promise that there will be some public purpose behind their profit motive. For instance, I don't think the government should be involved in acquiring land to build sports arenas that will be owned by wealthy team owners and used to pump the valuation of their sports franchises into the billions. 22 My problem with Kelo is that centering this issue on a white homeowner and the legal distinction between public \"use\" versus \"purpose\" ignores entire Black and brown communities that have been wiped off the damn map by the government's use of eminent domain. Where's the movie about Seneca Village? Where's the movie about the Black and Latino renters who get crushed every time the local team wants a new stadium? Where's the movie about all the people and communities who were destroyed by former New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses? 23 Yeah, if we're going to talk about eminent domain, we're going to talk about how many of our roads, highways, and beaches were figuratively built on top of the bones of Black and brown people who used to live there. I'm sorry, I just can't get up for this lawyer fight between public use and public purpose, when the government's definition of public use is so often merely \"playthings for white people,\" as if that's an acceptable constitutional definition of the term. 24 \"Little pink house\": Susette Kelo stands outside her home, which became a symbol in 2005 of the abuse of eminent domain. (Spencer Platt / Getty Images) T he first time I heard about eminent domain was in college, where I read Robert Caro's seminal book The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York . Moses is responsible for so much of the way modern cities look and feel, and not just in New York, because his methods were imported and copied throughout the country. Moses was a destroyer of Black and brown communities. And eminent domain is what allowed that asshole to be racist at an industrial scale. 25 If I may summarize one of the greatest modern biographies ever written in two sentences: Robert Moses was a deeply racist man who built highways, bridges, parks, beaches, and even housing projects by bulldozing the hopes, dreams, and often homes of people in his way. His main tactic for acquiring land for his projects was identifying vulnerable minority or immigrant communities, declaring their homes and land \"blighted,\" and then using the government's power of eminent domain to evict people from their homes over their objections and for a fraction of what their communities were actually worth. 26 Declaring a community \"blighted\" or a home \"condemned\" is a favorite trick of the government when it wants to avoid paying just compensation for the land it takes. It's what Moses did, repeatedly, throughout New York City in the 1930s, '40s, '50s, and into the '60s. Moses would target a community, have state assessors declare it a \"slum,\" and acquire the land through eminent domain at cut-rate prices. And it's a method many cities and states would copy under the guise of \"urban renewal.\" 27 Urban renewal laws authorize the state to seize land it has designated blighted and deteriorated in some way. The New York State urban renewal law is codified in Article 15 of New York Consolidated Laws, Section 500. Look at how the law describes the purpose of the policy in Section 501: 28 There exist in many municipalities within this state residential, non-residential, commercial, industrial or vacant areas, and combinations thereof, which are slum or blighted, or which are becoming slum or blighted areas because of substandard, insanitary, deteriorated or deteriorating conditions, factors, and characteristics, with or without tangible physical blight. The existence of such areas constitutes a serious and growing menace, is injurious to the public safety, health, morals and welfare, contributes increasingly to the spread of crime, juvenile delinquency and disease, necessitates excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for all forms of public service and constitutes a negative influence on adjacent properties impairing their economic soundness and stability, thereby threatening the source of public revenues. 29 Moses's domain: Robert Moses studies a map in 1958.

Look at how the law describes the purpose of the policy in Section 501: 28 There exist in many municipalities within this state residential, non-residential, commercial, industrial or vacant areas, and combinations thereof, which are slum or blighted, or which are becoming slum or blighted areas because of substandard, insanitary, deteriorated or deteriorating conditions, factors, and characteristics, with or without tangible physical blight. The existence of such areas constitutes a serious and growing menace, is injurious to the public safety, health, morals and welfare, contributes increasingly to the spread of crime, juvenile delinquency and disease, necessitates excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for all forms of public service and constitutes a negative influence on adjacent properties impairing their economic soundness and stability, thereby threatening the source of public revenues. 29 Moses's domain: Robert Moses studies a map in 1958. (AP) As Yoda might say, \"Mudhole? Slimy? My home, this is.\" Clearing out \"the slums\" and replacing run-down and dilapidated-looking buildings with fresh, shiny, economically productive buildings and infrastructure sounds like a great plan, unless you are the person being cleared out. Then, not only are you being displaced from your community, your \"just compensation\" becomes slum prices, leaving you only enough money to go and try to find a different slum to live in. The government usually doesn't pay people in so-called blighted communities what their homes are worth, and never pays them what the land will be worth after all the happy-clappy urban renewal takes place. 30 This is why eminent domain so often takes advantage of vulnerable people and communities. The government doesn't actually want to pay a fair price for the land and doesn't want to fight legal battles against well-connected and powerful communities who can protect their property and interests in court. 31 \"Condemnation\" is what happened to Susette Kelo's property, before the government took it. 32 The remains of San Juan Hill , the neighborhood Robert Moses erased to make way for Lincoln Center, seen rising in the background. (Archive Photos / Getty Images) B ut again, this tactic didn't just start happening in 2005, and to white people. We can go all the way back to the creation of Central Park a century and a half earlier and find the same tactics at play. An enormous park measuring 775 acres (today the park is actually 843 acres) in the middle of the island was not actually the first plan for an open green space in New York City. The first suggested site was a parcel of land, about 150 acres, along the East River between what is now 66th Street and 75th Street, known as Jones's Wood. In 1851, the New York State Assembly and Senate both passed resolutions to take the Jones's Wood property through eminent domain. It was happening. 33 More from Mystal The Many Remarkable Black Women Who Could Replace Stephen Breyer Elie Mystal Clarence and Ginni Thomas, the Supreme Court's Unethical \"It\" Couple Elie Mystal But the wealthy white landowners-John Jones's heirs, and another wealthy New York family, the Schermerhorns, whose property was included in some of the proposals for the park-didn't want to sell the land. Understand, neither the Joneses nor the Schermerhorns lived on the property full-time; this was the 1850s, and the Upper East Side might as well have been a Mars colony. The Joneses' and the Schermerhorns' primary residences were downtown, where any self-respecting wealthy New Yorker would live. These people just didn't want to sell their undeveloped \"country\" estates uptown to the city for a public works project. So the families sued New York State to block the state's taking of their land. 34 Did I mention that the Joneses and the Schermerhorns were white? They were white. And since they were white, all of the stuff I said earlier about the foundational principles of state sovereignty that eminent domain rests on, all of the stuff I said about how, legally speaking, the concept of eminent domain is so ingrained in the very conception of property that you scarcely need constitutional language acknowledging it, all of that stuff comes with the caveat of \"unless you are wealthy and white.\" 35 Of course, the Joneses and the Schermerhorns won their lawsuit against the state. Of course they did. A court ruled that the state resolution to acquire the property through eminent domain violated the due process rights of rich white people. Apparently the resolution allowed the state to back out of the deal but didn't allow the Joneses and the Schermerhorns the same right. I'd point out that of course the Joneses and the Schermerhorns had no right to \"back out\" of the deal, because the state was using its unquestionable sovereign power to force the families into taking the \"deal\" whether they liked it or not, but now I'm just shaking my fist at white judges who have been dead for 150 years. 36 And so, instead of displacing two white families who didn't even use their land as their primary residence, the city went forward with a new plan that included displacing over 200 Black people in Seneca Village who had built up an independent Black community on some of the only land they were allowed to purchase. All of the tricks that would later be deployed against Black communities in the 20th century were used against the people of Seneca Village in the 19th century. The newspapers called their land a \"swamp.\" The media called the people living there \"squatters\" (even though, again, 20 percent of the Black homeowners in all of New York City lived there), and, of course, the papers referred to their community as a \"n***er village.\" 37 The residents of Seneca Village also went to court to object to the government taking their land, but unlike the wealthy white families, they lost in court every time. The landowners were paid an average of $700 per lot. Andrew Williams, that shoe shiner turned landowner who bought the first lots from the Whiteheads, was paid $2,335 for his three lots and house, even though he initially asked for $3,500 in \"just compensation.\" Even when taking his land and destroying the community he helped to found, the state couldn't be bothered to pay the man what he asked for. 38 The Time Warner Center is a relatively recent construction that sits right at the southwestern entrance to Central Park. It sits on about two acres of land and is valued at approximately $1.5 billion. 39 New York City should go and find all the descendants of Seneca Village and pay them what their land is actually worth. I bet the government would be more cautious and fair when using its power of eminent domain if the compensation were ever just. 40\n\nTo understand eminent domain, you have to appreciate that, if you start from first principles, all land is \"public.\" All land is just there, claimed only by whoever or whatever happens to be standing on it, and can physically defend it, at a particular time. It's all God's land, if you're into that sort of thing. Or the king's land, if you lived in pretty much any pre-Enlightenment society. 10 Pillars of the community: Albro Lyons and Mary Joseph Marshall, noted abolitionists, owned plots of land in Seneca Village. \"Private\" property has surely always existed in some form-I'm certain that some of the ancient art we've uncovered and put in our museums was actually early modern \"Beware of Bear\" signs fashioned by cavemen who were sick of being solicited at their homes. But as a standing inalienable legal concept, fully private property that rulers are not allowed to violate at will is new (in geologic time) and kind of weird. Entire philosophical tracts on government (including the only one most people have ever heard of: John Locke's second treatise on government) have been written to explain, more or less, why private property should exist at all. Private property is not the natural or inevitable result of settled society. 11 Different legal systems treat the concept of private ownership differently. Take, for instance, the initial \"purchase\" of Manhattan Island by the Dutch . In 1626 Peter Minuit, director of New Netherland, reported that he bought Manhattan for 60 guilders (about $24, according to 19th-century historians). It would be too glib and easy to say that the Indigenous people who sold him the land didn't understand private property. As Arizona State law professor Robert Miller makes clear, they likely did have a fully functional concept of property \"exclusivity.\" But we would probably call the land deal a \"lease,\" not a \"purchase.\" In his book Law in American History , University of Virginia law professor G. Edward White makes the case that the Native Lenape were \"not relinquishing the island, but simply welcoming the Dutch as additional occupants.\" It was the colonizers who didn't understand or respect the deal. 12 Unlike private property, eminent domain does flow naturally and inevitably from the concept that ownership exists only insofar as the state is able to secure and defend the territory. If the state needs your land for some public purpose, and you can't raise an army to oppose the state, your land is forfeited. Living in a state that is willing to pay for the private land it needs to take is just a modern invention for property owners who would otherwise get screwed if they happen to live on land the state needs. Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius, whose On the Law of War and Peace from 1625 is one of the first real texts of international law, wrote: \"The property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the state.... But when this is done the state is bound to make good the loss to those who lose their property.\" That's the nice way of saying: \"There wouldn't be a West India Company without these fortifications, but here, take some money and go.\" The Dutch didn't really \"own\" Manhattan in 1626, because they couldn't defend Manhattan in 1626. Indeed, Wall Street is so named because there used to be a defensive freaking wall there. The wall was built by slaves the Dutch also \"bought\" and brought with them to defend the settlement of New Amsterdam from attacks by the Indigenous Americans, the British, or pirates. 13 Now, I would love to tell you what James Madison, author of the Fifth Amendment, meant by \"just compensation.\" But I can't. I can't even tell you why eminent domain is tacked onto this amendment and not some other. I can tell you that Madison's initial proposed language was: \"No person shall be...obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without just compensation.\" Congress changed it to its final version, but I can't tell you why. No record of whatever debate may have occurred exists. No Federalist Paper focuses on this particular topic. 14 What I can tell you is that when white people want your shit, they will take it, and Black people will rarely be justly compensated for the destruction of their wealth. 15 Marking the spot: A protest on Juneteenth in 2020 ended with a gathering at the site where Seneca Village once stood. gathering at the site where Seneca Village once stood. (Frank Franklin II / AP) F ighting against eminent domain has become a bit of a cause célèbre for libertarian forces on the right. They've even given it one of their cool, right-wing names, so that their entire objection can fit on the bumper sticker on somebody's truck. They call eminent domain actions \"takings.\" Get it? The government is \"taking\" your stuff; who could support that, right? 16 Much of the heat on the right is over what constitutes a taking at all. Eminent domain certainly refers to physical takings: You had some land and now you don't. But arguably, eminent domain should also come into play when the government dictates how you are allowed to use your property. These instances are called \"regulatory takings,\" and they happen when, say, the government declares your private property a national historic site and thus prevents you from demolishing it and building a CVS. How much compensation is the government required to give out then? 17 Another large area of contention happens when the government takes only part of your property. Let's say that the government wants to place a few wind turbines on part of your land. The private property owner can still live there, so is it a taking at all? What if the wind turbines are super noisy? What if they \"cause cancer\"? (Author's note: They don't.) What if they're really quiet but super ugly? What is the just compensation for ruining your view? 18 If you know anything about Republicans, you understand why the right-wingers get up for this fight, and you can see why liberals are generally on the side of the government when it comes to eminent domain. We need things like wind turbines and historic sites much more than we need libertarians bitching and moaning about whether they received enough of a vig from the government for their troubles. 19 If I were a Republican, I would spend the next 30 minutes of your life telling you about a 2005 case called Kelo v. City of New London . Conservatives complain about this case more than Pharaoh complained about Yahweh. The case is about a white lady, Susette Kelo, who didn't want to sell her pink house. In a twist to the standard eminent domain case, New London, Conn., wanted to acquire her land to then sell it to a private developer, which created a Supreme Court battle. In a controversial 5-4 decision, the liberal wing of the court, joined by Anthony Kennedy, ruled that taking private property and then selling it to private interests for economic redevelopment was indeed a constitutional use of the government's eminent domain power. 20 Conservatives went nuts. They made a fucking movie about this lady and her stupid house. Parts of the house were moved and \"rededicated\" at a new site, and it's now some kind of monument to the fight against big government overreach. 21 Reluctantly, I agree with the Republicans about this issue. Clarence Thomas, in dissent in Kelo , said that the majority was converting the \"public use\" allowed by the Fifth Amendment into any vague promise of a \"public purpose.\" And, God help me, I think Thomas was right about that. The government should not use its powers of eminent domain to essentially acquire land on the cheap for business interests, just because those businesses promise that there will be some public purpose behind their profit motive. For instance, I don't think the government should be involved in acquiring land to build sports arenas that will be owned by wealthy team owners and used to pump the valuation of their sports franchises into the billions. 22 My problem with Kelo is that centering this issue on a white homeowner and the legal distinction between public \"use\" versus \"purpose\" ignores entire Black and brown communities that have been wiped off the damn map by the government's use of eminent domain. Where's the movie about Seneca Village? Where's the movie about the Black and Latino renters who get crushed every time the local team wants a new stadium? Where's the movie about all the people and communities who were destroyed by former New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses? 23 Yeah, if we're going to talk about eminent domain, we're going to talk about how many of our roads, highways, and beaches were figuratively built on top of the bones of Black and brown people who used to live there. I'm sorry, I just can't get up for this lawyer fight between public use and public purpose, when the government's definition of public use is so often merely \"playthings for white people,\" as if that's an acceptable constitutional definition of the term. 24 \"Little pink house\": Susette Kelo stands outside her home, which became a symbol in 2005 of the abuse of eminent domain. (Spencer Platt / Getty Images) T he first time I heard about eminent domain was in college, where I read Robert Caro's seminal book The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York . Moses is responsible for so much of the way modern cities look and feel, and not just in New York, because his methods were imported and copied throughout the country. Moses was a destroyer of Black and brown communities. And eminent domain is what allowed that asshole to be racist at an industrial scale. 25 If I may summarize one of the greatest modern biographies ever written in two sentences: Robert Moses was a deeply racist man who built highways, bridges, parks, beaches, and even housing projects by bulldozing the hopes, dreams, and often homes of people in his way. His main tactic for acquiring land for his projects was identifying vulnerable minority or immigrant communities, declaring their homes and land \"blighted,\" and then using the government's power of eminent domain to evict people from their homes over their objections and for a fraction of what their communities were actually worth. 26 Declaring a community \"blighted\" or a home \"condemned\" is a favorite trick of the government when it wants to avoid paying just compensation for the land it takes. It's what Moses did, repeatedly, throughout New York City in the 1930s, '40s, '50s, and into the '60s. Moses would target a community, have state assessors declare it a \"slum,\" and acquire the land through eminent domain at cut-rate prices. And it's a method many cities and states would copy under the guise of \"urban renewal.\" 27 Urban renewal laws authorize the state to seize land it has designated blighted and deteriorated in some way. The New York State urban renewal law is codified in Article 15 of New York Consolidated Laws, Section 500.

My home, this is.\" Clearing out \"the slums\" and replacing run-down and dilapidated-looking buildings with fresh, shiny, economically productive buildings and infrastructure sounds like a great plan, unless you are the person being cleared out. Then, not only are you being displaced from your community, your \"just compensation\" becomes slum prices, leaving you only enough money to go and try to find a different slum to live in. The government usually doesn't pay people in so-called blighted communities what their homes are worth, and never pays them what the land will be worth after all the happy-clappy urban renewal takes place. 30 This is why eminent domain so often takes advantage of vulnerable people and communities. The government doesn't actually want to pay a fair price for the land and doesn't want to fight legal battles against well-connected and powerful communities who can protect their property and interests in court. 31 \"Condemnation\" is what happened to Susette Kelo's property, before the government took it. 32 The remains of San Juan Hill , the neighborhood Robert Moses erased to make way for Lincoln Center, seen rising in the background. (Archive Photos / Getty Images) B ut again, this tactic didn't just start happening in 2005, and to white people. We can go all the way back to the creation of Central Park a century and a half earlier and find the same tactics at play. An enormous park measuring 775 acres (today the park is actually 843 acres) in the middle of the island was not actually the first plan for an open green space in New York City. The first suggested site was a parcel of land, about 150 acres, along the East River between what is now 66th Street and 75th Street, known as Jones's Wood. In 1851, the New York State Assembly and Senate both passed resolutions to take the Jones's Wood property through eminent domain. It was happening. 33 More from Mystal The Many Remarkable Black Women Who Could Replace Stephen Breyer Elie Mystal Clarence and Ginni Thomas, the Supreme Court's Unethical \"It\" Couple Elie Mystal But the wealthy white landowners-John Jones's heirs, and another wealthy New York family, the Schermerhorns, whose property was included in some of the proposals for the park-didn't want to sell the land. Understand, neither the Joneses nor the Schermerhorns lived on the property full-time; this was the 1850s, and the Upper East Side might as well have been a Mars colony. The Joneses' and the Schermerhorns' primary residences were downtown, where any self-respecting wealthy New Yorker would live. These people just didn't want to sell their undeveloped \"country\" estates uptown to the city for a public works project. So the families sued New York State to block the state's taking of their land. 34 Did I mention that the Joneses and the Schermerhorns were white? They were white. And since they were white, all of the stuff I said earlier about the foundational principles of state sovereignty that eminent domain rests on, all of the stuff I said about how, legally speaking, the concept of eminent domain is so ingrained in the very conception of property that you scarcely need constitutional language acknowledging it, all of that stuff comes with the caveat of \"unless you are wealthy and white.\" 35 Of course, the Joneses and the Schermerhorns won their lawsuit against the state. Of course they did. A court ruled that the state resolution to acquire the property through eminent domain violated the due process rights of rich white people. Apparently the resolution allowed the state to back out of the deal but didn't allow the Joneses and the Schermerhorns the same right. I'd point out that of course the Joneses and the Schermerhorns had no right to \"back out\" of the deal, because the state was using its unquestionable sovereign power to force the families into taking the \"deal\" whether they liked it or not, but now I'm just shaking my fist at white judges who have been dead for 150 years. 36 And so, instead of displacing two white families who didn't even use their land as their primary residence, the city went forward with a new plan that included displacing over 200 Black people in Seneca Village who had built up an independent Black community on some of the only land they were allowed to purchase. All of the tricks that would later be deployed against Black communities in the 20th century were used against the people of Seneca Village in the 19th century. The newspapers called their land a \"swamp.\" The media called the people living there \"squatters\" (even though, again, 20 percent of the Black homeowners in all of New York City lived there), and, of course, the papers referred to their community as a \"n***er village.\" 37 The residents of Seneca Village also went to court to object to the government taking their land, but unlike the wealthy white families, they lost in court every time. The landowners were paid an average of $700 per lot. Andrew Williams, that shoe shiner turned landowner who bought the first lots from the Whiteheads, was paid $2,335 for his three lots and house, even though he initially asked for $3,500 in \"just compensation.\" Even when taking his land and destroying the community he helped to found, the state couldn't be bothered to pay the man what he asked for. 38 The Time Warner Center is a relatively recent construction that sits right at the southwestern entrance to Central Park. It sits on about two acres of land and is valued at approximately $1.5 billion. 39 New York City should go and find all the descendants of Seneca Village and pay them what their land is actually worth. I bet the government would be more cautious and fair when using its power of eminent domain if the compensation were ever just. 40\n\nDifferent legal systems treat the concept of private ownership differently. Take, for instance, the initial \"purchase\" of Manhattan Island by the Dutch . In 1626 Peter Minuit, director of New Netherland, reported that he bought Manhattan for 60 guilders (about $24, according to 19th-century historians). It would be too glib and easy to say that the Indigenous people who sold him the land didn't understand private property. As Arizona State law professor Robert Miller makes clear, they likely did have a fully functional concept of property \"exclusivity.\" But we would probably call the land deal a \"lease,\" not a \"purchase.\" In his book Law in American History , University of Virginia law professor G. Edward White makes the case that the Native Lenape were \"not relinquishing the island, but simply welcoming the Dutch as additional occupants.\" It was the colonizers who didn't understand or respect the deal. 12 Unlike private property, eminent domain does flow naturally and inevitably from the concept that ownership exists only insofar as the state is able to secure and defend the territory. If the state needs your land for some public purpose, and you can't raise an army to oppose the state, your land is forfeited. Living in a state that is willing to pay for the private land it needs to take is just a modern invention for property owners who would otherwise get screwed if they happen to live on land the state needs. Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius, whose On the Law of War and Peace from 1625 is one of the first real texts of international law, wrote: \"The property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the state.... But when this is done the state is bound to make good the loss to those who lose their property.\" That's the nice way of saying: \"There wouldn't be a West India Company without these fortifications, but here, take some money and go.\" The Dutch didn't really \"own\" Manhattan in 1626, because they couldn't defend Manhattan in 1626. Indeed, Wall Street is so named because there used to be a defensive freaking wall there. The wall was built by slaves the Dutch also \"bought\" and brought with them to defend the settlement of New Amsterdam from attacks by the Indigenous Americans, the British, or pirates. 13 Now, I would love to tell you what James Madison, author of the Fifth Amendment, meant by \"just compensation.\" But I can't. I can't even tell you why eminent domain is tacked onto this amendment and not some other. I can tell you that Madison's initial proposed language was: \"No person shall be...obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without just compensation.\" Congress changed it to its final version, but I can't tell you why. No record of whatever debate may have occurred exists. No Federalist Paper focuses on this particular topic. 14 What I can tell you is that when white people want your shit, they will take it, and Black people will rarely be justly compensated for the destruction of their wealth. 15 Marking the spot: A protest on Juneteenth in 2020 ended with a gathering at the site where Seneca Village once stood. gathering at the site where Seneca Village once stood. (Frank Franklin II / AP) F ighting against eminent domain has become a bit of a cause célèbre for libertarian forces on the right. They've even given it one of their cool, right-wing names, so that their entire objection can fit on the bumper sticker on somebody's truck. They call eminent domain actions \"takings.\" Get it? The government is \"taking\" your stuff; who could support that, right? 16 Much of the heat on the right is over what constitutes a taking at all. Eminent domain certainly refers to physical takings: You had some land and now you don't. But arguably, eminent domain should also come into play when the government dictates how you are allowed to use your property. These instances are called \"regulatory takings,\" and they happen when, say, the government declares your private property a national historic site and thus prevents you from demolishing it and building a CVS. How much compensation is the government required to give out then? 17 Another large area of contention happens when the government takes only part of your property. Let's say that the government wants to place a few wind turbines on part of your land. The private property owner can still live there, so is it a taking at all? What if the wind turbines are super noisy? What if they \"cause cancer\"? (Author's note: They don't.) What if they're really quiet but super ugly? What is the just compensation for ruining your view? 18 If you know anything about Republicans, you understand why the right-wingers get up for this fight, and you can see why liberals are generally on the side of the government when it comes to eminent domain. We need things like wind turbines and historic sites much more than we need libertarians bitching and moaning about whether they received enough of a vig from the government for their troubles. 19 If I were a Republican, I would spend the next 30 minutes of your life telling you about a 2005 case called Kelo v. City of New London . Conservatives complain about this case more than Pharaoh complained about Yahweh. The case is about a white lady, Susette Kelo, who didn't want to sell her pink house. In a twist to the standard eminent domain case, New London, Conn., wanted to acquire her land to then sell it to a private developer, which created a Supreme Court battle. In a controversial 5-4 decision, the liberal wing of the court, joined by Anthony Kennedy, ruled that taking private property and then selling it to private interests for economic redevelopment was indeed a constitutional use of the government's eminent domain power. 20 Conservatives went nuts. They made a fucking movie about this lady and her stupid house. Parts of the house were moved and \"rededicated\" at a new site, and it's now some kind of monument to the fight against big government overreach. 21 Reluctantly, I agree with the Republicans about this issue. Clarence Thomas, in dissent in Kelo , said that the majority was converting the \"public use\" allowed by the Fifth Amendment into any vague promise of a \"public purpose.\" And, God help me, I think Thomas was right about that. The government should not use its powers of eminent domain to essentially acquire land on the cheap for business interests, just because those businesses promise that there will be some public purpose behind their profit motive. For instance, I don't think the government should be involved in acquiring land to build sports arenas that will be owned by wealthy team owners and used to pump the valuation of their sports franchises into the billions. 22 My problem with Kelo is that centering this issue on a white homeowner and the legal distinction between public \"use\" versus \"purpose\" ignores entire Black and brown communities that have been wiped off the damn map by the government's use of eminent domain. Where's the movie about Seneca Village? Where's the movie about the Black and Latino renters who get crushed every time the local team wants a new stadium? Where's the movie about all the people and communities who were destroyed by former New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses? 23 Yeah, if we're going to talk about eminent domain, we're going to talk about how many of our roads, highways, and beaches were figuratively built on top of the bones of Black and brown people who used to live there. I'm sorry, I just can't get up for this lawyer fight between public use and public purpose, when the government's definition of public use is so often merely \"playthings for white people,\" as if that's an acceptable constitutional definition of the term. 24 \"Little pink house\": Susette Kelo stands outside her home, which became a symbol in 2005 of the abuse of eminent domain. (Spencer Platt / Getty Images) T he first time I heard about eminent domain was in college, where I read Robert Caro's seminal book The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York . Moses is responsible for so much of the way modern cities look and feel, and not just in New York, because his methods were imported and copied throughout the country. Moses was a destroyer of Black and brown communities. And eminent domain is what allowed that asshole to be racist at an industrial scale. 25 If I may summarize one of the greatest modern biographies ever written in two sentences: Robert Moses was a deeply racist man who built highways, bridges, parks, beaches, and even housing projects by bulldozing the hopes, dreams, and often homes of people in his way. His main tactic for acquiring land for his projects was identifying vulnerable minority or immigrant communities, declaring their homes and land \"blighted,\" and then using the government's power of eminent domain to evict people from their homes over their objections and for a fraction of what their communities were actually worth. 26 Declaring a community \"blighted\" or a home \"condemned\" is a favorite trick of the government when it wants to avoid paying just compensation for the land it takes. It's what Moses did, repeatedly, throughout New York City in the 1930s, '40s, '50s, and into the '60s. Moses would target a community, have state assessors declare it a \"slum,\" and acquire the land through eminent domain at cut-rate prices. And it's a method many cities and states would copy under the guise of \"urban renewal.\" 27 Urban renewal laws authorize the state to seize land it has designated blighted and deteriorated in some way. The New York State urban renewal law is codified in Article 15 of New York Consolidated Laws, Section 500. Look at how the law describes the purpose of the policy in Section 501: 28 There exist in many municipalities within this state residential, non-residential, commercial, industrial or vacant areas, and combinations thereof, which are slum or blighted, or which are becoming slum or blighted areas because of substandard, insanitary, deteriorated or deteriorating conditions, factors, and characteristics, with or without tangible physical blight. The existence of such areas constitutes a serious and growing menace, is injurious to the public safety, health, morals and welfare, contributes increasingly to the spread of crime, juvenile delinquency and disease, necessitates excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for all forms of public service and constitutes a negative influence on adjacent properties impairing their economic soundness and stability, thereby threatening the source of public revenues. 29 Moses's domain: Robert Moses studies a map in 1958.

Apparently the resolution allowed the state to back out of the deal but didn't allow the Joneses and the Schermerhorns the same right. I'd point out that of course the Joneses and the Schermerhorns had no right to \"back out\" of the deal, because the state was using its unquestionable sovereign power to force the families into taking the \"deal\" whether they liked it or not, but now I'm just shaking my fist at white judges who have been dead for 150 years. 36 And so, instead of displacing two white families who didn't even use their land as their primary residence, the city went forward with a new plan that included displacing over 200 Black people in Seneca Village who had built up an independent Black community on some of the only land they were allowed to purchase. All of the tricks that would later be deployed against Black communities in the 20th century were used against the people of Seneca Village in the 19th century. The newspapers called their land a \"swamp.\" The media called the people living there \"squatters\" (even though, again, 20 percent of the Black homeowners in all of New York City lived there), and, of course, the papers referred to their community as a \"n***er village.\" 37 The residents of Seneca Village also went to court to object to the government taking their land, but unlike the wealthy white families, they lost in court every time. The landowners were paid an average of $700 per lot. Andrew Williams, that shoe shiner turned landowner who bought the first lots from the Whiteheads, was paid $2,335 for his three lots and house, even though he initially asked for $3,500 in \"just compensation.\" Even when taking his land and destroying the community he helped to found, the state couldn't be bothered to pay the man what he asked for. 38 The Time Warner Center is a relatively recent construction that sits right at the southwestern entrance to Central Park. It sits on about two acres of land and is valued at approximately $1.5 billion. 39 New York City should go and find all the descendants of Seneca Village and pay them what their land is actually worth. I bet the government would be more cautious and fair when using its power of eminent domain if the compensation were ever just. 40\n\nNow, I would love to tell you what James Madison, author of the Fifth Amendment, meant by \"just compensation.\" But I can't. I can't even tell you why eminent domain is tacked onto this amendment and not some other. I can tell you that Madison's initial proposed language was: \"No person shall be...obliged to relinquish his property, where it may be necessary for public use, without just compensation.\" Congress changed it to its final version, but I can't tell you why. No record of whatever debate may have occurred exists. No Federalist Paper focuses on this particular topic. 14 What I can tell you is that when white people want your shit, they will take it, and Black people will rarely be justly compensated for the destruction of their wealth. 15 Marking the spot: A protest on Juneteenth in 2020 ended with a gathering at the site where Seneca Village once stood. gathering at the site where Seneca Village once stood. (Frank Franklin II / AP) F ighting against eminent domain has become a bit of a cause célèbre for libertarian forces on the right. They've even given it one of their cool, right-wing names, so that their entire objection can fit on the bumper sticker on somebody's truck. They call eminent domain actions \"takings.\" Get it? The government is \"taking\" your stuff; who could support that, right? 16 Much of the heat on the right is over what constitutes a taking at all. Eminent domain certainly refers to physical takings: You had some land and now you don't. But arguably, eminent domain should also come into play when the government dictates how you are allowed to use your property. These instances are called \"regulatory takings,\" and they happen when, say, the government declares your private property a national historic site and thus prevents you from demolishing it and building a CVS. How much compensation is the government required to give out then? 17 Another large area of contention happens when the government takes only part of your property. Let's say that the government wants to place a few wind turbines on part of your land. The private property owner can still live there, so is it a taking at all? What if the wind turbines are super noisy? What if they \"cause cancer\"? (Author's note: They don't.) What if they're really quiet but super ugly? What is the just compensation for ruining your view? 18 If you know anything about Republicans, you understand why the right-wingers get up for this fight, and you can see why liberals are generally on the side of the government when it comes to eminent domain. We need things like wind turbines and historic sites much more than we need libertarians bitching and moaning about whether they received enough of a vig from the government for their troubles. 19 If I were a Republican, I would spend the next 30 minutes of your life telling you about a 2005 case called Kelo v. City of New London . Conservatives complain about this case more than Pharaoh complained about Yahweh. The case is about a white lady, Susette Kelo, who didn't want to sell her pink house. In a twist to the standard eminent domain case, New London, Conn., wanted to acquire her land to then sell it to a private developer, which created a Supreme Court battle. In a controversial 5-4 decision, the liberal wing of the court, joined by Anthony Kennedy, ruled that taking private property and then selling it to private interests for economic redevelopment was indeed a constitutional use of the government's eminent domain power. 20 Conservatives went nuts. They made a fucking movie about this lady and her stupid house. Parts of the house were moved and \"rededicated\" at a new site, and it's now some kind of monument to the fight against big government overreach. 21 Reluctantly, I agree with the Republicans about this issue. Clarence Thomas, in dissent in Kelo , said that the majority was converting the \"public use\" allowed by the Fifth Amendment into any vague promise of a \"public purpose.\" And, God help me, I think Thomas was right about that. The government should not use its powers of eminent domain to essentially acquire land on the cheap for business interests, just because those businesses promise that there will be some public purpose behind their profit motive. For instance, I don't think the government should be involved in acquiring land to build sports arenas that will be owned by wealthy team owners and used to pump the valuation of their sports franchises into the billions. 22 My problem with Kelo is that centering this issue on a white homeowner and the legal distinction between public \"use\" versus \"purpose\" ignores entire Black and brown communities that have been wiped off the damn map by the government's use of eminent domain. Where's the movie about Seneca Village? Where's the movie about the Black and Latino renters who get crushed every time the local team wants a new stadium? Where's the movie about all the people and communities who were destroyed by former New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses? 23 Yeah, if we're going to talk about eminent domain, we're going to talk about how many of our roads, highways, and beaches were figuratively built on top of the bones of Black and brown people who used to live there. I'm sorry, I just can't get up for this lawyer fight between public use and public purpose, when the government's definition of public use is so often merely \"playthings for white people,\" as if that's an acceptable constitutional definition of the term. 24 \"Little pink house\": Susette Kelo stands outside her home, which became a symbol in 2005 of the abuse of eminent domain. (Spencer Platt / Getty Images) T he first time I heard about eminent domain was in college, where I read Robert Caro's seminal book The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York . Moses is responsible for so much of the way modern cities look and feel, and not just in New York, because his methods were imported and copied throughout the country. Moses was a destroyer of Black and brown communities. And eminent domain is what allowed that asshole to be racist at an industrial scale. 25 If I may summarize one of the greatest modern biographies ever written in two sentences: Robert Moses was a deeply racist man who built highways, bridges, parks, beaches, and even housing projects by bulldozing the hopes, dreams, and often homes of people in his way. His main tactic for acquiring land for his projects was identifying vulnerable minority or immigrant communities, declaring their homes and land \"blighted,\" and then using the government's power of eminent domain to evict people from their homes over their objections and for a fraction of what their communities were actually worth. 26 Declaring a community \"blighted\" or a home \"condemned\" is a favorite trick of the government when it wants to avoid paying just compensation for the land it takes. It's what Moses did, repeatedly, throughout New York City in the 1930s, '40s, '50s, and into the '60s. Moses would target a community, have state assessors declare it a \"slum,\" and acquire the land through eminent domain at cut-rate prices. And it's a method many cities and states would copy under the guise of \"urban renewal.\" 27 Urban renewal laws authorize the state to seize land it has designated blighted and deteriorated in some way. The New York State urban renewal law is codified in Article 15 of New York Consolidated Laws, Section 500. Look at how the law describes the purpose of the policy in Section 501: 28 There exist in many municipalities within this state residential, non-residential, commercial, industrial or vacant areas, and combinations thereof, which are slum or blighted, or which are becoming slum or blighted areas because of substandard, insanitary, deteriorated or deteriorating conditions, factors, and characteristics, with or without tangible physical blight. The existence of such areas constitutes a serious and growing menace, is injurious to the public safety, health, morals and welfare, contributes increasingly to the spread of crime, juvenile delinquency and disease, necessitates excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for all forms of public service and constitutes a negative influence on adjacent properties impairing their economic soundness and stability, thereby threatening the source of public revenues. 29 Moses's domain: Robert Moses studies a map in 1958. (AP) As Yoda might say, \"Mudhole? Slimy? My home, this is.\" Clearing out \"the slums\" and replacing run-down and dilapidated-looking buildings with fresh, shiny, economically productive buildings and infrastructure sounds like a great plan, unless you are the person being cleared out. Then, not only are you being displaced from your community, your \"just compensation\" becomes slum prices, leaving you only enough money to go and try to find a different slum to live in. The government usually doesn't pay people in so-called blighted communities what their homes are worth, and never pays them what the land will be worth after all the happy-clappy urban renewal takes place. 30 This is why eminent domain so often takes advantage of vulnerable people and communities. The government doesn't actually want to pay a fair price for the land and doesn't want to fight legal battles against well-connected and powerful communities who can protect their property and interests in court. 31 \"Condemnation\" is what happened to Susette Kelo's property, before the government took it. 32 The remains of San Juan Hill , the neighborhood Robert Moses erased to make way for Lincoln Center, seen rising in the background. (Archive Photos / Getty Images) B ut again, this tactic didn't just start happening in 2005, and to white people. We can go all the way back to the creation of Central Park a century and a half earlier and find the same tactics at play. An enormous park measuring 775 acres (today the park is actually 843 acres) in the middle of the island was not actually the first plan for an open green space in New York City. The first suggested site was a parcel of land, about 150 acres, along the East River between what is now 66th Street and 75th Street, known as Jones's Wood. In 1851, the New York State Assembly and Senate both passed resolutions to take the Jones's Wood property through eminent domain. It was happening. 33 More from Mystal The Many Remarkable Black Women Who Could Replace Stephen Breyer Elie Mystal Clarence and Ginni Thomas, the Supreme Court's Unethical \"It\" Couple Elie Mystal But the wealthy white landowners-John Jones's heirs, and another wealthy New York family, the Schermerhorns, whose property was included in some of the proposals for the park-didn't want to sell the land. Understand, neither the Joneses nor the Schermerhorns lived on the property full-time; this was the 1850s, and the Upper East Side might as well have been a Mars colony. The Joneses' and the Schermerhorns' primary residences were downtown, where any self-respecting wealthy New Yorker would live. These people just didn't want to sell their undeveloped \"country\" estates uptown to the city for a public works project. So the families sued New York State to block the state's taking of their land. 34 Did I mention that the Joneses and the Schermerhorns were white? They were white. And since they were white, all of the stuff I said earlier about the foundational principles of state sovereignty that eminent domain rests on, all of the stuff I said about how, legally speaking, the concept of eminent domain is so ingrained in the very conception of property that you scarcely need constitutional language acknowledging it, all of that stuff comes with the caveat of \"unless you are wealthy and white.\" 35 Of course, the Joneses and the Schermerhorns won their lawsuit against the state.

And eminent domain is what allowed that asshole to be racist at an industrial scale. 25 If I may summarize one of the greatest modern biographies ever written in two sentences: Robert Moses was a deeply racist man who built highways, bridges, parks, beaches, and even housing projects by bulldozing the hopes, dreams, and often homes of people in his way. His main tactic for acquiring land for his projects was identifying vulnerable minority or immigrant communities, declaring their homes and land \"blighted,\" and then using the government's power of eminent domain to evict people from their homes over their objections and for a fraction of what their communities were actually worth. 26 Declaring a community \"blighted\" or a home \"condemned\" is a favorite trick of the government when it wants to avoid paying just compensation for the land it takes. It's what Moses did, repeatedly, throughout New York City in the 1930s, '40s, '50s, and into the '60s. Moses would target a community, have state assessors declare it a \"slum,\" and acquire the land through eminent domain at cut-rate prices. And it's a method many cities and states would copy under the guise of \"urban renewal.\" 27 Urban renewal laws authorize the state to seize land it has designated blighted and deteriorated in some way. The New York State urban renewal law is codified in Article 15 of New York Consolidated Laws, Section 500. Look at how the law describes the purpose of the policy in Section 501: 28 There exist in many municipalities within this state residential, non-residential, commercial, industrial or vacant areas, and combinations thereof, which are slum or blighted, or which are becoming slum or blighted areas because of substandard, insanitary, deteriorated or deteriorating conditions, factors, and characteristics, with or without tangible physical blight. The existence of such areas constitutes a serious and growing menace, is injurious to the public safety, health, morals and welfare, contributes increasingly to the spread of crime, juvenile delinquency and disease, necessitates excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for all forms of public service and constitutes a negative influence on adjacent properties impairing their economic soundness and stability, thereby threatening the source of public revenues. 29 Moses's domain: Robert Moses studies a map in 1958. (AP) As Yoda might say, \"Mudhole? Slimy? My home, this is.\" Clearing out \"the slums\" and replacing run-down and dilapidated-looking buildings with fresh, shiny, economically productive buildings and infrastructure sounds like a great plan, unless you are the person being cleared out. Then, not only are you being displaced from your community, your \"just compensation\" becomes slum prices, leaving you only enough money to go and try to find a different slum to live in. The government usually doesn't pay people in so-called blighted communities what their homes are worth, and never pays them what the land will be worth after all the happy-clappy urban renewal takes place. 30 This is why eminent domain so often takes advantage of vulnerable people and communities. The government doesn't actually want to pay a fair price for the land and doesn't want to fight legal battles against well-connected and powerful communities who can protect their property and interests in court. 31 \"Condemnation\" is what happened to Susette Kelo's property, before the government took it. 32 The remains of San Juan Hill , the neighborhood Robert Moses erased to make way for Lincoln Center, seen rising in the background. (Archive Photos / Getty Images) B ut again, this tactic didn't just start happening in 2005, and to white people. We can go all the way back to the creation of Central Park a century and a half earlier and find the same tactics at play. An enormous park measuring 775 acres (today the park is actually 843 acres) in the middle of the island was not actually the first plan for an open green space in New York City. The first suggested site was a parcel of land, about 150 acres, along the East River between what is now 66th Street and 75th Street, known as Jones's Wood. In 1851, the New York State Assembly and Senate both passed resolutions to take the Jones's Wood property through eminent domain. It was happening. 33 More from Mystal The Many Remarkable Black Women Who Could Replace Stephen Breyer Elie Mystal Clarence and Ginni Thomas, the Supreme Court's Unethical \"It\" Couple Elie Mystal But the wealthy white landowners-John Jones's heirs, and another wealthy New York family, the Schermerhorns, whose property was included in some of the proposals for the park-didn't want to sell the land. Understand, neither the Joneses nor the Schermerhorns lived on the property full-time; this was the 1850s, and the Upper East Side might as well have been a Mars colony. The Joneses' and the Schermerhorns' primary residences were downtown, where any self-respecting wealthy New Yorker would live. These people just didn't want to sell their undeveloped \"country\" estates uptown to the city for a public works project. So the families sued New York State to block the state's taking of their land. 34 Did I mention that the Joneses and the Schermerhorns were white? They were white. And since they were white, all of the stuff I said earlier about the foundational principles of state sovereignty that eminent domain rests on, all of the stuff I said about how, legally speaking, the concept of eminent domain is so ingrained in the very conception of property that you scarcely need constitutional language acknowledging it, all of that stuff comes with the caveat of \"unless you are wealthy and white.\" 35 Of course, the Joneses and the Schermerhorns won their lawsuit against the state. Of course they did. A court ruled that the state resolution to acquire the property through eminent domain violated the due process rights of rich white people. Apparently the resolution allowed the state to back out of the deal but didn't allow the Joneses and the Schermerhorns the same right. I'd point out that of course the Joneses and the Schermerhorns had no right to \"back out\" of the deal, because the state was using its unquestionable sovereign power to force the families into taking the \"deal\" whether they liked it or not, but now I'm just shaking my fist at white judges who have been dead for 150 years. 36 And so, instead of displacing two white families who didn't even use their land as their primary residence, the city went forward with a new plan that included displacing over 200 Black people in Seneca Village who had built up an independent Black community on some of the only land they were allowed to purchase. All of the tricks that would later be deployed against Black communities in the 20th century were used against the people of Seneca Village in the 19th century. The newspapers called their land a \"swamp.\" The media called the people living there \"squatters\" (even though, again, 20 percent of the Black homeowners in all of New York City lived there), and, of course, the papers referred to their community as a \"n***er village.\" 37 The residents of Seneca Village also went to court to object to the government taking their land, but unlike the wealthy white families, they lost in court every time. The landowners were paid an average of $700 per lot. Andrew Williams, that shoe shiner turned landowner who bought the first lots from the Whiteheads, was paid $2,335 for his three lots and house, even though he initially asked for $3,500 in \"just compensation.\" Even when taking his land and destroying the community he helped to found, the state couldn't be bothered to pay the man what he asked for. 38 The Time Warner Center is a relatively recent construction that sits right at the southwestern entrance to Central Park. It sits on about two acres of land and is valued at approximately $1.5 billion. 39 New York City should go and find all the descendants of Seneca Village and pay them what their land is actually worth. I bet the government would be more cautious and fair when using its power of eminent domain if the compensation were ever just. 40\n\nMuch of the heat on the right is over what constitutes a taking at all. Eminent domain certainly refers to physical takings: You had some land and now you don't. But arguably, eminent domain should also come into play when the government dictates how you are allowed to use your property. These instances are called \"regulatory takings,\" and they happen when, say, the government declares your private property a national historic site and thus prevents you from demolishing it and building a CVS. How much compensation is the government required to give out then? 17 Another large area of contention happens when the government takes only part of your property. Let's say that the government wants to place a few wind turbines on part of your land. The private property owner can still live there, so is it a taking at all? What if the wind turbines are super noisy? What if they \"cause cancer\"? (Author's note: They don't.) What if they're really quiet but super ugly? What is the just compensation for ruining your view? 18 If you know anything about Republicans, you understand why the right-wingers get up for this fight, and you can see why liberals are generally on the side of the government when it comes to eminent domain. We need things like wind turbines and historic sites much more than we need libertarians bitching and moaning about whether they received enough of a vig from the government for their troubles. 19 If I were a Republican, I would spend the next 30 minutes of your life telling you about a 2005 case called Kelo v. City of New London . Conservatives complain about this case more than Pharaoh complained about Yahweh. The case is about a white lady, Susette Kelo, who didn't want to sell her pink house. In a twist to the standard eminent domain case, New London, Conn., wanted to acquire her land to then sell it to a private developer, which created a Supreme Court battle. In a controversial 5-4 decision, the liberal wing of the court, joined by Anthony Kennedy, ruled that taking private property and then selling it to private interests for economic redevelopment was indeed a constitutional use of the government's eminent domain power. 20 Conservatives went nuts. They made a fucking movie about this lady and her stupid house. Parts of the house were moved and \"rededicated\" at a new site, and it's now some kind of monument to the fight against big government overreach. 21 Reluctantly, I agree with the Republicans about this issue. Clarence Thomas, in dissent in Kelo , said that the majority was converting the \"public use\" allowed by the Fifth Amendment into any vague promise of a \"public purpose.\" And, God help me, I think Thomas was right about that. The government should not use its powers of eminent domain to essentially acquire land on the cheap for business interests, just because those businesses promise that there will be some public purpose behind their profit motive. For instance, I don't think the government should be involved in acquiring land to build sports arenas that will be owned by wealthy team owners and used to pump the valuation of their sports franchises into the billions. 22 My problem with Kelo is that centering this issue on a white homeowner and the legal distinction between public \"use\" versus \"purpose\" ignores entire Black and brown communities that have been wiped off the damn map by the government's use of eminent domain. Where's the movie about Seneca Village? Where's the movie about the Black and Latino renters who get crushed every time the local team wants a new stadium? Where's the movie about all the people and communities who were destroyed by former New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses? 23 Yeah, if we're going to talk about eminent domain, we're going to talk about how many of our roads, highways, and beaches were figuratively built on top of the bones of Black and brown people who used to live there. I'm sorry, I just can't get up for this lawyer fight between public use and public purpose, when the government's definition of public use is so often merely \"playthings for white people,\" as if that's an acceptable constitutional definition of the term. 24 \"Little pink house\": Susette Kelo stands outside her home, which became a symbol in 2005 of the abuse of eminent domain. (Spencer Platt / Getty Images) T he first time I heard about eminent domain was in college, where I read Robert Caro's seminal book The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York .

Where's the movie about all the people and communities who were destroyed by former New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses? 23 Yeah, if we're going to talk about eminent domain, we're going to talk about how many of our roads, highways, and beaches were figuratively built on top of the bones of Black and brown people who used to live there. I'm sorry, I just can't get up for this lawyer fight between public use and public purpose, when the government's definition of public use is so often merely \"playthings for white people,\" as if that's an acceptable constitutional definition of the term. 24 \"Little pink house\": Susette Kelo stands outside her home, which became a symbol in 2005 of the abuse of eminent domain. (Spencer Platt / Getty Images) T he first time I heard about eminent domain was in college, where I read Robert Caro's seminal book The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York . Moses is responsible for so much of the way modern cities look and feel, and not just in New York, because his methods were imported and copied throughout the country. Moses was a destroyer of Black and brown communities. And eminent domain is what allowed that asshole to be racist at an industrial scale. 25 If I may summarize one of the greatest modern biographies ever written in two sentences: Robert Moses was a deeply racist man who built highways, bridges, parks, beaches, and even housing projects by bulldozing the hopes, dreams, and often homes of people in his way. His main tactic for acquiring land for his projects was identifying vulnerable minority or immigrant communities, declaring their homes and land \"blighted,\" and then using the government's power of eminent domain to evict people from their homes over their objections and for a fraction of what their communities were actually worth. 26 Declaring a community \"blighted\" or a home \"condemned\" is a favorite trick of the government when it wants to avoid paying just compensation for the land it takes. It's what Moses did, repeatedly, throughout New York City in the 1930s, '40s, '50s, and into the '60s. Moses would target a community, have state assessors declare it a \"slum,\" and acquire the land through eminent domain at cut-rate prices. And it's a method many cities and states would copy under the guise of \"urban renewal.\" 27 Urban renewal laws authorize the state to seize land it has designated blighted and deteriorated in some way. The New York State urban renewal law is codified in Article 15 of New York Consolidated Laws, Section 500. Look at how the law describes the purpose of the policy in Section 501: 28 There exist in many municipalities within this state residential, non-residential, commercial, industrial or vacant areas, and combinations thereof, which are slum or blighted, or which are becoming slum or blighted areas because of substandard, insanitary, deteriorated or deteriorating conditions, factors, and characteristics, with or without tangible physical blight. The existence of such areas constitutes a serious and growing menace, is injurious to the public safety, health, morals and welfare, contributes increasingly to the spread of crime, juvenile delinquency and disease, necessitates excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for all forms of public service and constitutes a negative influence on adjacent properties impairing their economic soundness and stability, thereby threatening the source of public revenues. 29 Moses's domain: Robert Moses studies a map in 1958. (AP) As Yoda might say, \"Mudhole? Slimy? My home, this is.\" Clearing out \"the slums\" and replacing run-down and dilapidated-looking buildings with fresh, shiny, economically productive buildings and infrastructure sounds like a great plan, unless you are the person being cleared out. Then, not only are you being displaced from your community, your \"just compensation\" becomes slum prices, leaving you only enough money to go and try to find a different slum to live in. The government usually doesn't pay people in so-called blighted communities what their homes are worth, and never pays them what the land will be worth after all the happy-clappy urban renewal takes place. 30 This is why eminent domain so often takes advantage of vulnerable people and communities. The government doesn't actually want to pay a fair price for the land and doesn't want to fight legal battles against well-connected and powerful communities who can protect their property and interests in court. 31 \"Condemnation\" is what happened to Susette Kelo's property, before the government took it. 32 The remains of San Juan Hill , the neighborhood Robert Moses erased to make way for Lincoln Center, seen rising in the background. (Archive Photos / Getty Images) B ut again, this tactic didn't just start happening in 2005, and to white people. We can go all the way back to the creation of Central Park a century and a half earlier and find the same tactics at play. An enormous park measuring 775 acres (today the park is actually 843 acres) in the middle of the island was not actually the first plan for an open green space in New York City. The first suggested site was a parcel of land, about 150 acres, along the East River between what is now 66th Street and 75th Street, known as Jones's Wood. In 1851, the New York State Assembly and Senate both passed resolutions to take the Jones's Wood property through eminent domain. It was happening. 33 More from Mystal The Many Remarkable Black Women Who Could Replace Stephen Breyer Elie Mystal Clarence and Ginni Thomas, the Supreme Court's Unethical \"It\" Couple Elie Mystal But the wealthy white landowners-John Jones's heirs, and another wealthy New York family, the Schermerhorns, whose property was included in some of the proposals for the park-didn't want to sell the land. Understand, neither the Joneses nor the Schermerhorns lived on the property full-time; this was the 1850s, and the Upper East Side might as well have been a Mars colony. The Joneses' and the Schermerhorns' primary residences were downtown, where any self-respecting wealthy New Yorker would live. These people just didn't want to sell their undeveloped \"country\" estates uptown to the city for a public works project. So the families sued New York State to block the state's taking of their land. 34 Did I mention that the Joneses and the Schermerhorns were white? They were white. And since they were white, all of the stuff I said earlier about the foundational principles of state sovereignty that eminent domain rests on, all of the stuff I said about how, legally speaking, the concept of eminent domain is so ingrained in the very conception of property that you scarcely need constitutional language acknowledging it, all of that stuff comes with the caveat of \"unless you are wealthy and white.\" 35 Of course, the Joneses and the Schermerhorns won their lawsuit against the state. Of course they did. A court ruled that the state resolution to acquire the property through eminent domain violated the due process rights of rich white people. Apparently the resolution allowed the state to back out of the deal but didn't allow the Joneses and the Schermerhorns the same right. I'd point out that of course the Joneses and the Schermerhorns had no right to \"back out\" of the deal, because the state was using its unquestionable sovereign power to force the families into taking the \"deal\" whether they liked it or not, but now I'm just shaking my fist at white judges who have been dead for 150 years. 36 And so, instead of displacing two white families who didn't even use their land as their primary residence, the city went forward with a new plan that included displacing over 200 Black people in Seneca Village who had built up an independent Black community on some of the only land they were allowed to purchase. All of the tricks that would later be deployed against Black communities in the 20th century were used against the people of Seneca Village in the 19th century. The newspapers called their land a \"swamp.\" The media called the people living there \"squatters\" (even though, again, 20 percent of the Black homeowners in all of New York City lived there), and, of course, the papers referred to their community as a \"n***er village.\" 37 The residents of Seneca Village also went to court to object to the government taking their land, but unlike the wealthy white families, they lost in court every time. The landowners were paid an average of $700 per lot. Andrew Williams, that shoe shiner turned landowner who bought the first lots from the Whiteheads, was paid $2,335 for his three lots and house, even though he initially asked for $3,500 in \"just compensation.\" Even when taking his land and destroying the community he helped to found, the state couldn't be bothered to pay the man what he asked for. 38 The Time Warner Center is a relatively recent construction that sits right at the southwestern entrance to Central Park. It sits on about two acres of land and is valued at approximately $1.5 billion. 39 New York City should go and find all the descendants of Seneca Village and pay them what their land is actually worth. I bet the government would be more cautious and fair when using its power of eminent domain if the compensation were ever just. 40\n\nIf I were a Republican, I would spend the next 30 minutes of your life telling you about a 2005 case called Kelo v. City of New London . Conservatives complain about this case more than Pharaoh complained about Yahweh. The case is about a white lady, Susette Kelo, who didn't want to sell her pink house. In a twist to the standard eminent domain case, New London, Conn., wanted to acquire her land to then sell it to a private developer, which created a Supreme Court battle. In a controversial 5-4 decision, the liberal wing of the court, joined by Anthony Kennedy, ruled that taking private property and then selling it to private interests for economic redevelopment was indeed a constitutional use of the government's eminent domain power. 20 Conservatives went nuts. They made a fucking movie about this lady and her stupid house. Parts of the house were moved and \"rededicated\" at a new site, and it's now some kind of monument to the fight against big government overreach. 21 Reluctantly, I agree with the Republicans about this issue. Clarence Thomas, in dissent in Kelo , said that the majority was converting the \"public use\" allowed by the Fifth Amendment into any vague promise of a \"public purpose.\" And, God help me, I think Thomas was right about that. The government should not use its powers of eminent domain to essentially acquire land on the cheap for business interests, just because those businesses promise that there will be some public purpose behind their profit motive. For instance, I don't think the government should be involved in acquiring land to build sports arenas that will be owned by wealthy team owners and used to pump the valuation of their sports franchises into the billions. 22 My problem with Kelo is that centering this issue on a white homeowner and the legal distinction between public \"use\" versus \"purpose\" ignores entire Black and brown communities that have been wiped off the damn map by the government's use of eminent domain.

The existence of such areas constitutes a serious and growing menace, is injurious to the public safety, health, morals and welfare, contributes increasingly to the spread of crime, juvenile delinquency and disease, necessitates excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for all forms of public service and constitutes a negative influence on adjacent properties impairing their economic soundness and stability, thereby threatening the source of public revenues. 29 Moses's domain: Robert Moses studies a map in 1958. (AP) As Yoda might say, \"Mudhole? Slimy? My home, this is.\" Clearing out \"the slums\" and replacing run-down and dilapidated-looking buildings with fresh, shiny, economically productive buildings and infrastructure sounds like a great plan, unless you are the person being cleared out. Then, not only are you being displaced from your community, your \"just compensation\" becomes slum prices, leaving you only enough money to go and try to find a different slum to live in. The government usually doesn't pay people in so-called blighted communities what their homes are worth, and never pays them what the land will be worth after all the happy-clappy urban renewal takes place. 30 This is why eminent domain so often takes advantage of vulnerable people and communities. The government doesn't actually want to pay a fair price for the land and doesn't want to fight legal battles against well-connected and powerful communities who can protect their property and interests in court. 31 \"Condemnation\" is what happened to Susette Kelo's property, before the government took it. 32 The remains of San Juan Hill , the neighborhood Robert Moses erased to make way for Lincoln Center, seen rising in the background. (Archive Photos / Getty Images) B ut again, this tactic didn't just start happening in 2005, and to white people. We can go all the way back to the creation of Central Park a century and a half earlier and find the same tactics at play. An enormous park measuring 775 acres (today the park is actually 843 acres) in the middle of the island was not actually the first plan for an open green space in New York City. The first suggested site was a parcel of land, about 150 acres, along the East River between what is now 66th Street and 75th Street, known as Jones's Wood. In 1851, the New York State Assembly and Senate both passed resolutions to take the Jones's Wood property through eminent domain. It was happening. 33 More from Mystal The Many Remarkable Black Women Who Could Replace Stephen Breyer Elie Mystal Clarence and Ginni Thomas, the Supreme Court's Unethical \"It\" Couple Elie Mystal But the wealthy white landowners-John Jones's heirs, and another wealthy New York family, the Schermerhorns, whose property was included in some of the proposals for the park-didn't want to sell the land. Understand, neither the Joneses nor the Schermerhorns lived on the property full-time; this was the 1850s, and the Upper East Side might as well have been a Mars colony. The Joneses' and the Schermerhorns' primary residences were downtown, where any self-respecting wealthy New Yorker would live. These people just didn't want to sell their undeveloped \"country\" estates uptown to the city for a public works project. So the families sued New York State to block the state's taking of their land. 34 Did I mention that the Joneses and the Schermerhorns were white? They were white. And since they were white, all of the stuff I said earlier about the foundational principles of state sovereignty that eminent domain rests on, all of the stuff I said about how, legally speaking, the concept of eminent domain is so ingrained in the very conception of property that you scarcely need constitutional language acknowledging it, all of that stuff comes with the caveat of \"unless you are wealthy and white.\" 35 Of course, the Joneses and the Schermerhorns won their lawsuit against the state. Of course they did. A court ruled that the state resolution to acquire the property through eminent domain violated the due process rights of rich white people. Apparently the resolution allowed the state to back out of the deal but didn't allow the Joneses and the Schermerhorns the same right. I'd point out that of course the Joneses and the Schermerhorns had no right to \"back out\" of the deal, because the state was using its unquestionable sovereign power to force the families into taking the \"deal\" whether they liked it or not, but now I'm just shaking my fist at white judges who have been dead for 150 years. 36 And so, instead of displacing two white families who didn't even use their land as their primary residence, the city went forward with a new plan that included displacing over 200 Black people in Seneca Village who had built up an independent Black community on some of the only land they were allowed to purchase. All of the tricks that would later be deployed against Black communities in the 20th century were used against the people of Seneca Village in the 19th century. The newspapers called their land a \"swamp.\" The media called the people living there \"squatters\" (even though, again, 20 percent of the Black homeowners in all of New York City lived there), and, of course, the papers referred to their community as a \"n***er village.\" 37 The residents of Seneca Village also went to court to object to the government taking their land, but unlike the wealthy white families, they lost in court every time. The landowners were paid an average of $700 per lot. Andrew Williams, that shoe shiner turned landowner who bought the first lots from the Whiteheads, was paid $2,335 for his three lots and house, even though he initially asked for $3,500 in \"just compensation.\" Even when taking his land and destroying the community he helped to found, the state couldn't be bothered to pay the man what he asked for. 38 The Time Warner Center is a relatively recent construction that sits right at the southwestern entrance to Central Park. It sits on about two acres of land and is valued at approximately $1.5 billion. 39 New York City should go and find all the descendants of Seneca Village and pay them what their land is actually worth. I bet the government would be more cautious and fair when using its power of eminent domain if the compensation were ever just. 40\n\nMy problem with Kelo is that centering this issue on a white homeowner and the legal distinction between public \"use\" versus \"purpose\" ignores entire Black and brown communities that have been wiped off the damn map by the government's use of eminent domain. Where's the movie about Seneca Village? Where's the movie about the Black and Latino renters who get crushed every time the local team wants a new stadium? Where's the movie about all the people and communities who were destroyed by former New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses? 23 Yeah, if we're going to talk about eminent domain, we're going to talk about how many of our roads, highways, and beaches were figuratively built on top of the bones of Black and brown people who used to live there. I'm sorry, I just can't get up for this lawyer fight between public use and public purpose, when the government's definition of public use is so often merely \"playthings for white people,\" as if that's an acceptable constitutional definition of the term. 24 \"Little pink house\": Susette Kelo stands outside her home, which became a symbol in 2005 of the abuse of eminent domain. (Spencer Platt / Getty Images) T he first time I heard about eminent domain was in college, where I read Robert Caro's seminal book The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York . Moses is responsible for so much of the way modern cities look and feel, and not just in New York, because his methods were imported and copied throughout the country. Moses was a destroyer of Black and brown communities. And eminent domain is what allowed that asshole to be racist at an industrial scale. 25 If I may summarize one of the greatest modern biographies ever written in two sentences: Robert Moses was a deeply racist man who built highways, bridges, parks, beaches, and even housing projects by bulldozing the hopes, dreams, and often homes of people in his way. His main tactic for acquiring land for his projects was identifying vulnerable minority or immigrant communities, declaring their homes and land \"blighted,\" and then using the government's power of eminent domain to evict people from their homes over their objections and for a fraction of what their communities were actually worth. 26 Declaring a community \"blighted\" or a home \"condemned\" is a favorite trick of the government when it wants to avoid paying just compensation for the land it takes. It's what Moses did, repeatedly, throughout New York City in the 1930s, '40s, '50s, and into the '60s. Moses would target a community, have state assessors declare it a \"slum,\" and acquire the land through eminent domain at cut-rate prices. And it's a method many cities and states would copy under the guise of \"urban renewal.\" 27 Urban renewal laws authorize the state to seize land it has designated blighted and deteriorated in some way. The New York State urban renewal law is codified in Article 15 of New York Consolidated Laws, Section 500. Look at how the law describes the purpose of the policy in Section 501: 28 There exist in many municipalities within this state residential, non-residential, commercial, industrial or vacant areas, and combinations thereof, which are slum or blighted, or which are becoming slum or blighted areas because of substandard, insanitary, deteriorated or deteriorating conditions, factors, and characteristics, with or without tangible physical blight.

Look at how the law describes the purpose of the policy in Section 501: 28 There exist in many municipalities within this state residential, non-residential, commercial, industrial or vacant areas, and combinations thereof, which are slum or blighted, or which are becoming slum or blighted areas because of substandard, insanitary, deteriorated or deteriorating conditions, factors, and characteristics, with or without tangible physical blight. The existence of such areas constitutes a serious and growing menace, is injurious to the public safety, health, morals and welfare, contributes increasingly to the spread of crime, juvenile delinquency and disease, necessitates excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for all forms of public service and constitutes a negative influence on adjacent properties impairing their economic soundness and stability, thereby threatening the source of public revenues. 29 Moses's domain: Robert Moses studies a map in 1958. (AP) As Yoda might say, \"Mudhole? Slimy? My home, this is.\" Clearing out \"the slums\" and replacing run-down and dilapidated-looking buildings with fresh, shiny, economically productive buildings and infrastructure sounds like a great plan, unless you are the person being cleared out. Then, not only are you being displaced from your community, your \"just compensation\" becomes slum prices, leaving you only enough money to go and try to find a different slum to live in. The government usually doesn't pay people in so-called blighted communities what their homes are worth, and never pays them what the land will be worth after all the happy-clappy urban renewal takes place. 30 This is why eminent domain so often takes advantage of vulnerable people and communities. The government doesn't actually want to pay a fair price for the land and doesn't want to fight legal battles against well-connected and powerful communities who can protect their property and interests in court. 31 \"Condemnation\" is what happened to Susette Kelo's property, before the government took it. 32 The remains of San Juan Hill , the neighborhood Robert Moses erased to make way for Lincoln Center, seen rising in the background. (Archive Photos / Getty Images) B ut again, this tactic didn't just start happening in 2005, and to white people. We can go all the way back to the creation of Central Park a century and a half earlier and find the same tactics at play. An enormous park measuring 775 acres (today the park is actually 843 acres) in the middle of the island was not actually the first plan for an open green space in New York City. The first suggested site was a parcel of land, about 150 acres, along the East River between what is now 66th Street and 75th Street, known as Jones's Wood. In 1851, the New York State Assembly and Senate both passed resolutions to take the Jones's Wood property through eminent domain. It was happening. 33 More from Mystal The Many Remarkable Black Women Who Could Replace Stephen Breyer Elie Mystal Clarence and Ginni Thomas, the Supreme Court's Unethical \"It\" Couple Elie Mystal But the wealthy white landowners-John Jones's heirs, and another wealthy New York family, the Schermerhorns, whose property was included in some of the proposals for the park-didn't want to sell the land. Understand, neither the Joneses nor the Schermerhorns lived on the property full-time; this was the 1850s, and the Upper East Side might as well have been a Mars colony. The Joneses' and the Schermerhorns' primary residences were downtown, where any self-respecting wealthy New Yorker would live. These people just didn't want to sell their undeveloped \"country\" estates uptown to the city for a public works project. So the families sued New York State to block the state's taking of their land. 34 Did I mention that the Joneses and the Schermerhorns were white? They were white. And since they were white, all of the stuff I said earlier about the foundational principles of state sovereignty that eminent domain rests on, all of the stuff I said about how, legally speaking, the concept of eminent domain is so ingrained in the very conception of property that you scarcely need constitutional language acknowledging it, all of that stuff comes with the caveat of \"unless you are wealthy and white.\" 35 Of course, the Joneses and the Schermerhorns won their lawsuit against the state. Of course they did. A court ruled that the state resolution to acquire the property through eminent domain violated the due process rights of rich white people. Apparently the resolution allowed the state to back out of the deal but didn't allow the Joneses and the Schermerhorns the same right. I'd point out that of course the Joneses and the Schermerhorns had no right to \"back out\" of the deal, because the state was using its unquestionable sovereign power to force the families into taking the \"deal\" whether they liked it or not, but now I'm just shaking my fist at white judges who have been dead for 150 years. 36 And so, instead of displacing two white families who didn't even use their land as their primary residence, the city went forward with a new plan that included displacing over 200 Black people in Seneca Village who had built up an independent Black community on some of the only land they were allowed to purchase. All of the tricks that would later be deployed against Black communities in the 20th century were used against the people of Seneca Village in the 19th century. The newspapers called their land a \"swamp.\" The media called the people living there \"squatters\" (even though, again, 20 percent of the Black homeowners in all of New York City lived there), and, of course, the papers referred to their community as a \"n***er village.\" 37 The residents of Seneca Village also went to court to object to the government taking their land, but unlike the wealthy white families, they lost in court every time. The landowners were paid an average of $700 per lot. Andrew Williams, that shoe shiner turned landowner who bought the first lots from the Whiteheads, was paid $2,335 for his three lots and house, even though he initially asked for $3,500 in \"just compensation.\" Even when taking his land and destroying the community he helped to found, the state couldn't be bothered to pay the man what he asked for. 38 The Time Warner Center is a relatively recent construction that sits right at the southwestern entrance to Central Park. It sits on about two acres of land and is valued at approximately $1.5 billion. 39 New York City should go and find all the descendants of Seneca Village and pay them what their land is actually worth. I bet the government would be more cautious and fair when using its power of eminent domain if the compensation were ever just. 40\n\nDeclaring a community \"blighted\" or a home \"condemned\" is a favorite trick of the government when it wants to avoid paying just compensation for the land it takes. It's what Moses did, repeatedly, throughout New York City in the 1930s, '40s, '50s, and into the '60s. Moses would target a community, have state assessors declare it a \"slum,\" and acquire the land through eminent domain at cut-rate prices. And it's a method many cities and states would copy under the guise of \"urban renewal.\" 27 Urban renewal laws authorize the state to seize land it has designated blighted and deteriorated in some way.

Understand, neither the Joneses nor the Schermerhorns lived on the property full-time; this was the 1850s, and the Upper East Side might as well have been a Mars colony. The Joneses' and the Schermerhorns' primary residences were downtown, where any self-respecting wealthy New Yorker would live. These people just didn't want to sell their undeveloped \"country\" estates uptown to the city for a public works project. So the families sued New York State to block the state's taking of their land. 34 Did I mention that the Joneses and the Schermerhorns were white? They were white. And since they were white, all of the stuff I said earlier about the foundational principles of state sovereignty that eminent domain rests on, all of the stuff I said about how, legally speaking, the concept of eminent domain is so ingrained in the very conception of property that you scarcely need constitutional language acknowledging it, all of that stuff comes with the caveat of \"unless you are wealthy and white.\" 35 Of course, the Joneses and the Schermerhorns won their lawsuit against the state. Of course they did. A court ruled that the state resolution to acquire the property through eminent domain violated the due process rights of rich white people. Apparently the resolution allowed the state to back out of the deal but didn't allow the Joneses and the Schermerhorns the same right. I'd point out that of course the Joneses and the Schermerhorns had no right to \"back out\" of the deal, because the state was using its unquestionable sovereign power to force the families into taking the \"deal\" whether they liked it or not, but now I'm just shaking my fist at white judges who have been dead for 150 years. 36 And so, instead of displacing two white families who didn't even use their land as their primary residence, the city went forward with a new plan that included displacing over 200 Black people in Seneca Village who had built up an independent Black community on some of the only land they were allowed to purchase. All of the tricks that would later be deployed against Black communities in the 20th century were used against the people of Seneca Village in the 19th century. The newspapers called their land a \"swamp.\" The media called the people living there \"squatters\" (even though, again, 20 percent of the Black homeowners in all of New York City lived there), and, of course, the papers referred to their community as a \"n***er village.\" 37 The residents of Seneca Village also went to court to object to the government taking their land, but unlike the wealthy white families, they lost in court every time. The landowners were paid an average of $700 per lot. Andrew Williams, that shoe shiner turned landowner who bought the first lots from the Whiteheads, was paid $2,335 for his three lots and house, even though he initially asked for $3,500 in \"just compensation.\" Even when taking his land and destroying the community he helped to found, the state couldn't be bothered to pay the man what he asked for. 38 The Time Warner Center is a relatively recent construction that sits right at the southwestern entrance to Central Park. It sits on about two acres of land and is valued at approximately $1.5 billion. 39 New York City should go and find all the descendants of Seneca Village and pay them what their land is actually worth. I bet the government would be more cautious and fair when using its power of eminent domain if the compensation were ever just. 40\n\n\"Condemnation\" is what happened to Susette Kelo's property, before the government took it. 32 The remains of San Juan Hill , the neighborhood Robert Moses erased to make way for Lincoln Center, seen rising in the background.

We can go all the way back to the creation of Central Park a century and a half earlier and find the same tactics at play. An enormous park measuring 775 acres (today the park is actually 843 acres) in the middle of the island was not actually the first plan for an open green space in New York City.

A group of white men shot at young Black Lives Matter protesters on consecutive nights in Minneapolis last weekend, injuring five people. Donald Trump, still a leading Republican presidential candidate, proposed creating a database and ID cards for Muslims, leading even some Republicans to label him as a fascist. White Student Unions are popping up around the country in response to demands that university administrations do more to fight racism on campus. Finally, Robert Dear opened fire at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic last week, killing three people and injuring nine. As a white man, I want to understand what it is about the ideas of \"whiteness\" or \"America\" that's causing white American males to be the country's largest terror threat . Why isn't white violence that is intended to shut down black movements, or male violence intended to intimidate women, considered terrorism by so many? I want to understand why, at this particular moment, white American men seem to be losing their minds. Related Article The Minneapolis Shootings Are the Kind of Violence Meant to Keep Black People in Their Place Mychal Denzel Smith Since the civil-rights movement, the Republican establishment - the big bankers and CEOs that actually run the party - have danced with racists in the white grassroots by conflating racism and fear of the government. Instead of providing all Americans with decent healthcare, education, jobs, or housing, the racist white grassroots and rich establishment agreed that everyone should be on their own - so black people and immigrants don't accidentally get anything good. The \" Southern Strategy \" helped create two national, highly polarized political parties that disagree on every issue, leading to the extreme gridlock that's crippling Washington. From Goldwater to the Tea Party, the far right parlayed white people's fear of blacks and other people of color into an anti-government backlash that gutted the middle class. All of us live with the extreme inequality these politics have generated. Denying healthcare to poor people will keep some black people from getting things, but poverty knows no color. Making college unaffordable to all but the rich will keep some black people off campuses, but it will also burden white families. Ironically, racism and white supremacy has made non-rich white people deal with some of the same issues that people of color have faced for centuries. This is an old truth of white supremacy, as Martin Luther King Jr. reminded us. \"If it may be said of the slavery era that the white man took the world and gave the Negro Jesus,\" King said back in 1965 , \"then it may be said of the Reconstruction era that the southern aristocracy took the world and gave the poor white man Jim Crow.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Now, many white people don't know if they will be able to provide themselves or their families with a decent life. They don't believe the American Dream applies to them or think the government cares about people like them. They don't know if future generations will be better off. And they're not entirely wrong; in an era of stagnating wages and increasing housing, education and healthcare costs, most Americans' quality of life is diminishing, even when the economy grows, because all the growth goes to the top 1 percent. The political institutions through which our society is supposed to deal with these problems have been captured by the same interests that are causing the problems. Democracy-rule of the people, by the people, for the people-is in peril. The emergence of fascism has always depended upon democracy's failure. The growing proto-fascist, white-supremacist movement in the Republican Party is preying upon non-rich white people who are literally dying of despair , turning to drugs and suicide to deal with a reality they can't bear, and a society they believe doesn't care for them. Over the past 15 years, the death rate for white men has actually increased - an unprecedented rise in modern times that's comparable to the emergence of the AIDS epidemic. White people are right that they are under attack - they're just pointing to the wrong culprits. For the wealthy elite who fund the political operatives and media companies that tell white people who to blame for their plight, the race war is a very useful substitute for the class war. White America has not been terrorized by people of color; we have terrorized people of color. What's new in this moment is the Republican establishment's losing control of the grassroots for the first time in the post-civil rights era. Instead of the corporate Republicans winning the white vote with coded racist language, the grassroots outsiders are competing with one another to be more and more openly racist. Trump and Ben Carson are far-right populists rushing to turn non-rich white people's fear and despair into ever-greater inequality by blaming others for their situation. The villainization of Mexicans, black people, and Muslims that's happened over the course of this election season isn't new, but the nakedness of the hatred is fueled by white panic about their diminishing prospects in the face of growing economic and political inequality. White rage at economic inequality and fear of a corrupt political establishment is not the only thing driving the backlash. The movement for black lives is making every American confront how we treat black people and decide if black lives matter to them. Movements create change by forcing people to pick a side: Opponents and supporters are both polarized, and each escalates in their tactics and commitment. In this moment of polarization, those who politically, economically, or emotionally depend upon the domination of black people are forced to cling ever harder to their hatred. The successes of past movements are good indications that the polarization happening across America will be, in sum, a good thing. The mask is slipping and more people are seeing the violence inherent in maintaining white supremacy and empire. The courage and wisdom of this generation of young black leaders has already shifted the scope of what's possible in a very short amount of time. The #4thPrecinctShutdown in Minneapolis was able to win two of their three demands within a week; the Chicago police officer who shot Laquan McDonald has been charged with murder. Protests often work and, right now, despite how bad it often feels, the movement is definitely winning. The mask is slipping and more people are seeing the violence inherent in maintaining white supremacy and empire. But for every cop charged with murder for killing a black child, there is a Darren Wilson. For every city full of young black leaders transforming this country for the better, there is a potential Dylann Roof. The process of ending white supremacy will make this a better country for everyone, but in the struggle it will almost certainly bring more pain to those who already suffer most. White supremacy is a source of constant terror to people of color and is damaging to the humanity and prosperity of people who are considered white. So, what would it take for the sad, angry people clinging to their whiteness to have something else to feel good about? How can other white people hasten the end of an America that depends on violence, exclusion, and domination? I think, as Ta-Nehisi Coates says, that it will take us waking other white people up to the myth of their whiteness. People believe they are white because someone told them they are. Who is white has shifted over time to reflect the political needs of those in power, and will continue to change. Americans have to learn that race is invented, but the experience and rules of racism are all too real. Moving beyond white supremacy will require more of us that \" believe ourselves to be white \" to confront some tragic, simple human truths: Life is short and fragile, each of us has very little control over our fates, and we all belong to the world; it does not belong to us. The myth of white America depends upon denying these basic, shared aspects of our humanity. It means denying the terror we inflict upon others to enable our domination - and seeing every act that opposes our domination as terrorism. The myth will continue to have power until white Americans realize we are connected to the other peoples of this country and this world, that \"whiteness\" is a myth invented for profit, and that America is an imagined political community like any other, and is only good if we make it so. GET THE LATEST NEWS AND ANALYSIS DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX EACH MORNING SIGN UP! I have come to believe the fears of white Americans are really just reflections of the things that white supremacy and empire have done to others. White America has not been terrorized by people of color; we have terrorized people of color. Black wealth is not based on stealing from white people; white wealth is based on stealing from black people. Instead of confronting the reality of our history and what our country has become for most people, too many Americans would rather kill those mourning their dead and send orphans and widows to a hellscape we created - all in order to preserve the myths of whiteness, masculinity, and empire. I have to imagine the white men who commit these egregious acts of terror do so out of a silent, personal fear that the myths of whiteness and masculinity engender in themselves. The dehumanization white supremacists perpetrate on others has to be, in part, a projection of the dehumanization they feel themselves. The sad men that hang out on 4chan plotting the destruction of innocent others don't believe they can be the strong, virile, white male dominators they are prescribed to be. No one who feels good about themselves talks as much as Donald Trump does about how he is a \"winner\" and other people are \"losers.\" No one who is confident of their humanity would deny acceptance to a 5-year-old orphan refugee . And yet, these white, American men are taught they must be silent in considering their fear, because to even admit they feel it would be to undo the myths of whiteness and masculinity they cling to. I can't claim to have answers about how we get more white Americans to treat others as human beings. I do believe that all Americans would be better off if we moved beyond white supremacy and empire, and it's the responsibility of white people to say so. They are myths that rob us all of our humanity, and keep us from uniting against the plutocrats that are stealing our future. I have faith in this generation of leaders of color, and hope they will lead a multi-racial coalition that will uproot white supremacy, once and for all. I hope that white people will follow their lead, as well as join organizations like SURJ that prepare white people to contribute to the struggle against white supremacy. I have to believe that the next task of our movements -not just the movement for black lives but all of our movements - is to put forth a vision of what it means to be an American that's based on a recognition of our shared humanity. In the 21st century, we can't keep living on systems designed for a time before emancipation, electricity, or public education. We have to put forth a vision of what this country and our lives could be like if it actually was designed to work for all its people.\n\nA group of white men shot at young Black Lives Matter protesters on consecutive nights in Minneapolis last weekend, injuring five people. Donald Trump, still a leading Republican presidential candidate, proposed creating a database and ID cards for Muslims, leading even some Republicans to label him as a fascist. White Student Unions are popping up around the country in response to demands that university administrations do more to fight racism on campus. Finally, Robert Dear opened fire at a Colorado Springs Planned Parenthood clinic last week, killing three people and injuring nine. As a white man, I want to understand what it is about the ideas of \"whiteness\" or \"America\" that's causing white American males to be the country's largest terror threat . Why isn't white violence that is intended to shut down black movements, or male violence intended to intimidate women, considered terrorism by so many? I want to understand why, at this particular moment, white American men seem to be losing their minds.

Instead of providing all Americans with decent healthcare, education, jobs, or housing, the racist white grassroots and rich establishment agreed that everyone should be on their own - so black people and immigrants don't accidentally get anything good. The \" Southern Strategy \" helped create two national, highly polarized political parties that disagree on every issue, leading to the extreme gridlock that's crippling Washington. From Goldwater to the Tea Party, the far right parlayed white people's fear of blacks and other people of color into an anti-government backlash that gutted the middle class. All of us live with the extreme inequality these politics have generated. Denying healthcare to poor people will keep some black people from getting things, but poverty knows no color. Making college unaffordable to all but the rich will keep some black people off campuses, but it will also burden white families. Ironically, racism and white supremacy has made non-rich white people deal with some of the same issues that people of color have faced for centuries. This is an old truth of white supremacy, as Martin Luther King Jr. reminded us. \"If it may be said of the slavery era that the white man took the world and gave the Negro Jesus,\" King said back in 1965 , \"then it may be said of the Reconstruction era that the southern aristocracy took the world and gave the poor white man Jim Crow.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Now, many white people don't know if they will be able to provide themselves or their families with a decent life. They don't believe the American Dream applies to them or think the government cares about people like them. They don't know if future generations will be better off. And they're not entirely wrong; in an era of stagnating wages and increasing housing, education and healthcare costs, most Americans' quality of life is diminishing, even when the economy grows, because all the growth goes to the top 1 percent. The political institutions through which our society is supposed to deal with these problems have been captured by the same interests that are causing the problems. Democracy-rule of the people, by the people, for the people-is in peril. The emergence of fascism has always depended upon democracy's failure. The growing proto-fascist, white-supremacist movement in the Republican Party is preying upon non-rich white people who are literally dying of despair , turning to drugs and suicide to deal with a reality they can't bear, and a society they believe doesn't care for them. Over the past 15 years, the death rate for white men has actually increased - an unprecedented rise in modern times that's comparable to the emergence of the AIDS epidemic. White people are right that they are under attack - they're just pointing to the wrong culprits. For the wealthy elite who fund the political operatives and media companies that tell white people who to blame for their plight, the race war is a very useful substitute for the class war. White America has not been terrorized by people of color; we have terrorized people of color.

White supremacy is a source of constant terror to people of color and is damaging to the humanity and prosperity of people who are considered white. So, what would it take for the sad, angry people clinging to their whiteness to have something else to feel good about? How can other white people hasten the end of an America that depends on violence, exclusion, and domination? I think, as Ta-Nehisi Coates says, that it will take us waking other white people up to the myth of their whiteness. People believe they are white because someone told them they are. Who is white has shifted over time to reflect the political needs of those in power, and will continue to change. Americans have to learn that race is invented, but the experience and rules of racism are all too real. Moving beyond white supremacy will require more of us that \" believe ourselves to be white \" to confront some tragic, simple human truths: Life is short and fragile, each of us has very little control over our fates, and we all belong to the world; it does not belong to us. The myth of white America depends upon denying these basic, shared aspects of our humanity. It means denying the terror we inflict upon others to enable our domination - and seeing every act that opposes our domination as terrorism. The myth will continue to have power until white Americans realize we are connected to the other peoples of this country and this world, that \"whiteness\" is a myth invented for profit, and that America is an imagined political community like any other, and is only good if we make it so. GET THE LATEST NEWS AND ANALYSIS DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX EACH MORNING SIGN UP! I have come to believe the fears of white Americans are really just reflections of the things that white supremacy and empire have done to others. White America has not been terrorized by people of color; we have terrorized people of color. Black wealth is not based on stealing from white people; white wealth is based on stealing from black people. Instead of confronting the reality of our history and what our country has become for most people, too many Americans would rather kill those mourning their dead and send orphans and widows to a hellscape we created - all in order to preserve the myths of whiteness, masculinity, and empire. I have to imagine the white men who commit these egregious acts of terror do so out of a silent, personal fear that the myths of whiteness and masculinity engender in themselves. The dehumanization white supremacists perpetrate on others has to be, in part, a projection of the dehumanization they feel themselves. The sad men that hang out on 4chan plotting the destruction of innocent others don't believe they can be the strong, virile, white male dominators they are prescribed to be. No one who feels good about themselves talks as much as Donald Trump does about how he is a \"winner\" and other people are \"losers.\" No one who is confident of their humanity would deny acceptance to a 5-year-old orphan refugee . And yet, these white, American men are taught they must be silent in considering their fear, because to even admit they feel it would be to undo the myths of whiteness and masculinity they cling to. I can't claim to have answers about how we get more white Americans to treat others as human beings. I do believe that all Americans would be better off if we moved beyond white supremacy and empire, and it's the responsibility of white people to say so. They are myths that rob us all of our humanity, and keep us from uniting against the plutocrats that are stealing our future. I have faith in this generation of leaders of color, and hope they will lead a multi-racial coalition that will uproot white supremacy, once and for all. I hope that white people will follow their lead, as well as join organizations like SURJ that prepare white people to contribute to the struggle against white supremacy. I have to believe that the next task of our movements -not just the movement for black lives but all of our movements - is to put forth a vision of what it means to be an American that's based on a recognition of our shared humanity. In the 21st century, we can't keep living on systems designed for a time before emancipation, electricity, or public education. We have to put forth a vision of what this country and our lives could be like if it actually was designed to work for all its people.\n\nMychal Denzel Smith\n\nSince the civil-rights movement, the Republican establishment - the big bankers and CEOs that actually run the party - have danced with racists in the white grassroots by conflating racism and fear of the government. Instead of providing all Americans with decent healthcare, education, jobs, or housing, the racist white grassroots and rich establishment agreed that everyone should be on their own - so black people and immigrants don't accidentally get anything good. The \" Southern Strategy \" helped create two national, highly polarized political parties that disagree on every issue, leading to the extreme gridlock that's crippling Washington. From Goldwater to the Tea Party, the far right parlayed white people's fear of blacks and other people of color into an anti-government backlash that gutted the middle class. All of us live with the extreme inequality these politics have generated. Denying healthcare to poor people will keep some black people from getting things, but poverty knows no color. Making college unaffordable to all but the rich will keep some black people off campuses, but it will also burden white families. Ironically, racism and white supremacy has made non-rich white people deal with some of the same issues that people of color have faced for centuries. This is an old truth of white supremacy, as Martin Luther King Jr. reminded us. \"If it may be said of the slavery era that the white man took the world and gave the Negro Jesus,\" King said back in 1965 , \"then it may be said of the Reconstruction era that the southern aristocracy took the world and gave the poor white man Jim Crow.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Now, many white people don't know if they will be able to provide themselves or their families with a decent life. They don't believe the American Dream applies to them or think the government cares about people like them. They don't know if future generations will be better off. And they're not entirely wrong; in an era of stagnating wages and increasing housing, education and healthcare costs, most Americans' quality of life is diminishing, even when the economy grows, because all the growth goes to the top 1 percent. The political institutions through which our society is supposed to deal with these problems have been captured by the same interests that are causing the problems. Democracy-rule of the people, by the people, for the people-is in peril. The emergence of fascism has always depended upon democracy's failure. The growing proto-fascist, white-supremacist movement in the Republican Party is preying upon non-rich white people who are literally dying of despair , turning to drugs and suicide to deal with a reality they can't bear, and a society they believe doesn't care for them. Over the past 15 years, the death rate for white men has actually increased - an unprecedented rise in modern times that's comparable to the emergence of the AIDS epidemic. White people are right that they are under attack - they're just pointing to the wrong culprits. For the wealthy elite who fund the political operatives and media companies that tell white people who to blame for their plight, the race war is a very useful substitute for the class war. White America has not been terrorized by people of color; we have terrorized people of color. What's new in this moment is the Republican establishment's losing control of the grassroots for the first time in the post-civil rights era. Instead of the corporate Republicans winning the white vote with coded racist language, the grassroots outsiders are competing with one another to be more and more openly racist. Trump and Ben Carson are far-right populists rushing to turn non-rich white people's fear and despair into ever-greater inequality by blaming others for their situation. The villainization of Mexicans, black people, and Muslims that's happened over the course of this election season isn't new, but the nakedness of the hatred is fueled by white panic about their diminishing prospects in the face of growing economic and political inequality. White rage at economic inequality and fear of a corrupt political establishment is not the only thing driving the backlash. The movement for black lives is making every American confront how we treat black people and decide if black lives matter to them. Movements create change by forcing people to pick a side: Opponents and supporters are both polarized, and each escalates in their tactics and commitment. In this moment of polarization, those who politically, economically, or emotionally depend upon the domination of black people are forced to cling ever harder to their hatred. The successes of past movements are good indications that the polarization happening across America will be, in sum, a good thing. The mask is slipping and more people are seeing the violence inherent in maintaining white supremacy and empire. The courage and wisdom of this generation of young black leaders has already shifted the scope of what's possible in a very short amount of time. The #4thPrecinctShutdown in Minneapolis was able to win two of their three demands within a week; the Chicago police officer who shot Laquan McDonald has been charged with murder. Protests often work and, right now, despite how bad it often feels, the movement is definitely winning. The mask is slipping and more people are seeing the violence inherent in maintaining white supremacy and empire. But for every cop charged with murder for killing a black child, there is a Darren Wilson. For every city full of young black leaders transforming this country for the better, there is a potential Dylann Roof.

And they're not entirely wrong; in an era of stagnating wages and increasing housing, education and healthcare costs, most Americans' quality of life is diminishing, even when the economy grows, because all the growth goes to the top 1 percent. The political institutions through which our society is supposed to deal with these problems have been captured by the same interests that are causing the problems. Democracy-rule of the people, by the people, for the people-is in peril. The emergence of fascism has always depended upon democracy's failure. The growing proto-fascist, white-supremacist movement in the Republican Party is preying upon non-rich white people who are literally dying of despair , turning to drugs and suicide to deal with a reality they can't bear, and a society they believe doesn't care for them. Over the past 15 years, the death rate for white men has actually increased - an unprecedented rise in modern times that's comparable to the emergence of the AIDS epidemic. White people are right that they are under attack - they're just pointing to the wrong culprits. For the wealthy elite who fund the political operatives and media companies that tell white people who to blame for their plight, the race war is a very useful substitute for the class war. White America has not been terrorized by people of color; we have terrorized people of color. What's new in this moment is the Republican establishment's losing control of the grassroots for the first time in the post-civil rights era. Instead of the corporate Republicans winning the white vote with coded racist language, the grassroots outsiders are competing with one another to be more and more openly racist. Trump and Ben Carson are far-right populists rushing to turn non-rich white people's fear and despair into ever-greater inequality by blaming others for their situation. The villainization of Mexicans, black people, and Muslims that's happened over the course of this election season isn't new, but the nakedness of the hatred is fueled by white panic about their diminishing prospects in the face of growing economic and political inequality. White rage at economic inequality and fear of a corrupt political establishment is not the only thing driving the backlash. The movement for black lives is making every American confront how we treat black people and decide if black lives matter to them. Movements create change by forcing people to pick a side: Opponents and supporters are both polarized, and each escalates in their tactics and commitment. In this moment of polarization, those who politically, economically, or emotionally depend upon the domination of black people are forced to cling ever harder to their hatred. The successes of past movements are good indications that the polarization happening across America will be, in sum, a good thing. The mask is slipping and more people are seeing the violence inherent in maintaining white supremacy and empire. The courage and wisdom of this generation of young black leaders has already shifted the scope of what's possible in a very short amount of time. The #4thPrecinctShutdown in Minneapolis was able to win two of their three demands within a week; the Chicago police officer who shot Laquan McDonald has been charged with murder. Protests often work and, right now, despite how bad it often feels, the movement is definitely winning. The mask is slipping and more people are seeing the violence inherent in maintaining white supremacy and empire. But for every cop charged with murder for killing a black child, there is a Darren Wilson. For every city full of young black leaders transforming this country for the better, there is a potential Dylann Roof. The process of ending white supremacy will make this a better country for everyone, but in the struggle it will almost certainly bring more pain to those who already suffer most. White supremacy is a source of constant terror to people of color and is damaging to the humanity and prosperity of people who are considered white. So, what would it take for the sad, angry people clinging to their whiteness to have something else to feel good about? How can other white people hasten the end of an America that depends on violence, exclusion, and domination? I think, as Ta-Nehisi Coates says, that it will take us waking other white people up to the myth of their whiteness. People believe they are white because someone told them they are. Who is white has shifted over time to reflect the political needs of those in power, and will continue to change. Americans have to learn that race is invented, but the experience and rules of racism are all too real. Moving beyond white supremacy will require more of us that \" believe ourselves to be white \" to confront some tragic, simple human truths: Life is short and fragile, each of us has very little control over our fates, and we all belong to the world; it does not belong to us. The myth of white America depends upon denying these basic, shared aspects of our humanity. It means denying the terror we inflict upon others to enable our domination - and seeing every act that opposes our domination as terrorism. The myth will continue to have power until white Americans realize we are connected to the other peoples of this country and this world, that \"whiteness\" is a myth invented for profit, and that America is an imagined political community like any other, and is only good if we make it so.

I have come to believe the fears of white Americans are really just reflections of the things that white supremacy and empire have done to others. White America has not been terrorized by people of color; we have terrorized people of color. Black wealth is not based on stealing from white people; white wealth is based on stealing from black people. Instead of confronting the reality of our history and what our country has become for most people, too many Americans would rather kill those mourning their dead and send orphans and widows to a hellscape we created - all in order to preserve the myths of whiteness, masculinity, and empire. I have to imagine the white men who commit these egregious acts of terror do so out of a silent, personal fear that the myths of whiteness and masculinity engender in themselves. The dehumanization white supremacists perpetrate on others has to be, in part, a projection of the dehumanization they feel themselves. The sad men that hang out on 4chan plotting the destruction of innocent others don't believe they can be the strong, virile, white male dominators they are prescribed to be. No one who feels good about themselves talks as much as Donald Trump does about how he is a \"winner\" and other people are \"losers.\" No one who is confident of their humanity would deny acceptance to a 5-year-old orphan refugee . And yet, these white, American men are taught they must be silent in considering their fear, because to even admit they feel it would be to undo the myths of whiteness and masculinity they cling to. I can't claim to have answers about how we get more white Americans to treat others as human beings. I do believe that all Americans would be better off if we moved beyond white supremacy and empire, and it's the responsibility of white people to say so. They are myths that rob us all of our humanity, and keep us from uniting against the plutocrats that are stealing our future. I have faith in this generation of leaders of color, and hope they will lead a multi-racial coalition that will uproot white supremacy, once and for all. I hope that white people will follow their lead, as well as join organizations like SURJ that prepare white people to contribute to the struggle against white supremacy. I have to believe that the next task of our movements -not just the movement for black lives but all of our movements - is to put forth a vision of what it means to be an American that's based on a recognition of our shared humanity. In the 21st century, we can't keep living on systems designed for a time before emancipation, electricity, or public education.

Instead of confronting the reality of our history and what our country has become for most people, too many Americans would rather kill those mourning their dead and send orphans and widows to a hellscape we created - all in order to preserve the myths of whiteness, masculinity, and empire. I have to imagine the white men who commit these egregious acts of terror do so out of a silent, personal fear that the myths of whiteness and masculinity engender in themselves. The dehumanization white supremacists perpetrate on others has to be, in part, a projection of the dehumanization they feel themselves. The sad men that hang out on 4chan plotting the destruction of innocent others don't believe they can be the strong, virile, white male dominators they are prescribed to be. No one who feels good about themselves talks as much as Donald Trump does about how he is a \"winner\" and other people are \"losers.\" No one who is confident of their humanity would deny acceptance to a 5-year-old orphan refugee . And yet, these white, American men are taught they must be silent in considering their fear, because to even admit they feel it would be to undo the myths of whiteness and masculinity they cling to. I can't claim to have answers about how we get more white Americans to treat others as human beings. I do believe that all Americans would be better off if we moved beyond white supremacy and empire, and it's the responsibility of white people to say so. They are myths that rob us all of our humanity, and keep us from uniting against the plutocrats that are stealing our future. I have faith in this generation of leaders of color, and hope they will lead a multi-racial coalition that will uproot white supremacy, once and for all. I hope that white people will follow their lead, as well as join organizations like SURJ that prepare white people to contribute to the struggle against white supremacy. I have to believe that the next task of our movements -not just the movement for black lives but all of our movements - is to put forth a vision of what it means to be an American that's based on a recognition of our shared humanity. In the 21st century, we can't keep living on systems designed for a time before emancipation, electricity, or public education. We have to put forth a vision of what this country and our lives could be like if it actually was designed to work for all its people.\n\nWhite supremacy is a source of constant terror to people of color and is damaging to the humanity and prosperity of people who are considered white. So, what would it take for the sad, angry people clinging to their whiteness to have something else to feel good about? How can other white people hasten the end of an America that depends on violence, exclusion, and domination? I think, as Ta-Nehisi Coates says, that it will take us waking other white people up to the myth of their whiteness. People believe they are white because someone told them they are. Who is white has shifted over time to reflect the political needs of those in power, and will continue to change. Americans have to learn that race is invented, but the experience and rules of racism are all too real. Moving beyond white supremacy will require more of us that \" believe ourselves to be white \" to confront some tragic, simple human truths: Life is short and fragile, each of us has very little control over our fates, and we all belong to the world; it does not belong to us. The myth of white America depends upon denying these basic, shared aspects of our humanity. It means denying the terror we inflict upon others to enable our domination - and seeing every act that opposes our domination as terrorism. The myth will continue to have power until white Americans realize we are connected to the other peoples of this country and this world, that \"whiteness\" is a myth invented for profit, and that America is an imagined political community like any other, and is only good if we make it so.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Some answer with that pioneering sportsman and proponent of \"Muscular Christianity\" Theodore Roosevelt. When I reply that the answer is actually President Johnson, they say \"Oh, Lyndon Johnson.\" But it was actually Andrew Johnson. Almost exactly 150 years ago, in August 1865, two baseball teams called the Washington Nationals and the Brooklyn Atlantics traveled to Washington to meet with President Johnson at the White House. This was when Johnson declared baseball to be \"the National Game.\" Professional baseball was in its early stages, yet Andrew Johnson-hardly a canny politician-knew enough to bathe in its glow. As long as there have been professional sports, there have been presidents attempting to use them to burnish their own credibility. That is exactly why pro sports teams should reassess adherence to this long-standing ritual and refuse to visit President-Elect Trump in the White House. We have not had this many outspoken political athletes-centrally on the question of anti-racism-at any point since the 1960s. A collective refusal to normalize this president is a critical part of resisting Trump's agenda of hatred and division. It's very telling to see which sports figures are supporting Trump. They are a coterie of embittered and discredited people like the 86-year-old swindler Don King , the 76-year-old rape-apologist/bully Bob Knight , and professional Twitter-Troll Curt Schilling . Fittingly, Trump has already told one political athlete to just shut up and play. He responded to Colin Kaepernick's anthem protests by saying, \"Maybe he should find a country that works better for him. Let him try. It won't happen.\" Whether or not one agrees with Kaepernick's politics, an attack on him is an attack on any athlete who believes that playing a sport doesn't negate their right to political opinions. There is an alternative to normalizing Donald Trump, hinted at by Cleveland Cavalier Richard Jefferson. Before his team visited 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on November 10, he posted a message on social media saying, \"Words cannot express the honor I feel being the last team to visit the White House tomorrow.\" We can only hope that is the case. Sports is used to wash political leaders of sin through the presence of athletic glory. To visit the White House under a Donald Trump presidency is to normalize a presidency that is anything but normal. It's to perfume an administration that loudly celebrates torture, a Muslim registry, environmental catastrophe, bigotry, and kicking people off of their healthcare, condemning them to death. The only proper response is resistance. San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich put this perfectly when he said the week after the elections : I'm just sick to my stomach. Not basically because the Republicans won or anything, but the disgusting tenor and tone and all the comments that have been xenophobic, homophobic, racist, misogynistic.... The fact that people can just gloss that over and start talking about the transition team, and we're all gonna be Kumbaya now and try to make the country good without talking about about any of those things.... That's disgusting.... I'm a rich white guy, and I'm sick to my stomach thinking about it. I can't imagine being a Muslim right now, or a woman, or an African-American, a Hispanic, a handicapped person, how disenfranchised they might feel. And for anyone in those groups that voted for him, it's just beyond my comprehension how they ignore all that. And so, my final conclusion is, my big fear is we are Rome. The sports world has shown in the last year that it is developing a new kind of consciousness. The best way to extend that in the months ahead is for no team to ever grace this White House with its presence. No one is required to visit; it is not written in any rule book or collective-bargaining agreement. Athletes have a choice, and the choice should be to just say \"no\" to going to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, unless it's with a picket sign in their hand.\n\nAlmost exactly 150 years ago, in August 1865, two baseball teams called the Washington Nationals and the Brooklyn Atlantics traveled to Washington to meet with President Johnson at the White House.

The sports world has shown in the last year that it is developing a new kind of consciousness. The best way to extend that in the months ahead is for no team to ever grace this White House with its presence. No one is required to visit; it is not written in any rule book or collective-bargaining agreement. Athletes have a choice, and the choice should be to just say \"no\" to going to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, unless it's with a picket sign in their hand.\n\nIt's very telling to see which sports figures are supporting Trump. They are a coterie of embittered and discredited people like the 86-year-old swindler Don King , the 76-year-old rape-apologist/bully Bob Knight , and professional Twitter-Troll Curt Schilling . Fittingly, Trump has already told one political athlete to just shut up and play. He responded to Colin Kaepernick's anthem protests by saying, \"Maybe he should find a country that works better for him. Let him try. It won't happen.\" Whether or not one agrees with Kaepernick's politics, an attack on him is an attack on any athlete who believes that playing a sport doesn't negate their right to political opinions. There is an alternative to normalizing Donald Trump, hinted at by Cleveland Cavalier Richard Jefferson. Before his team visited 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on November 10, he posted a message on social media saying, \"Words cannot express the honor I feel being the last team to visit the White House tomorrow.\" We can only hope that is the case. Sports is used to wash political leaders of sin through the presence of athletic glory. To visit the White House under a Donald Trump presidency is to normalize a presidency that is anything but normal. It's to perfume an administration that loudly celebrates torture, a Muslim registry, environmental catastrophe, bigotry, and kicking people off of their healthcare, condemning them to death. The only proper response is resistance. San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich put this perfectly when he said the week after the elections : I'm just sick to my stomach. Not basically because the Republicans won or anything, but the disgusting tenor and tone and all the comments that have been xenophobic, homophobic, racist, misogynistic.... The fact that people can just gloss that over and start talking about the transition team, and we're all gonna be Kumbaya now and try to make the country good without talking about about any of those things.... That's disgusting.... I'm a rich white guy, and I'm sick to my stomach thinking about it. I can't imagine being a Muslim right now, or a woman, or an African-American, a Hispanic, a handicapped person, how disenfranchised they might feel.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

(AP.) A lot of what I hope to be doing with this blog I fear might verge on pedantry. Too much of what we observe today on the right we act as if started the day before yesterday. Always, we need to set the clock back further-as a political necessity. We have to establish deeper provenances. Or else we just reinvent, and reinvent and reinvent the wheel. Or, in this case, reinvent the assault rifle. Some of the best coverage and reflection on December 14-the day of the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary-has come from the outstanding folks at Josh Marshall's Talking Points Memo. And part of the mix over at TPM is its reprinting of e-mails from ordinary readers, offering marvelous worm's-eye views and analyses of the issues of the day. Sometimes, however, the worm's-eye view only views what the worm's eye views. On December 15, as the nature of the fearsome arsenal took inside that first grade classroom-the Bushmaster XM-15, the 10mm Glock SF and 9mm SIG Sauer handgun-was becoming apparent, but before, I think, it had been established that the mother he stole the guns from before murdering her may have been a \"full-on\" prepper, arming for Armageddon, TPM printed this interesting e-mail from a reader identified as SS : I was raised with guns. More to the point, my childhood was steeped in gun lore.... I bring this up to establish my bona-fides. The gun culture that we have today in the U.S. is not the gun culture, so to speak, that I remember from my youth. It's too simple to say that it's \"sick\"; it's more accurately an absurd fetishization. I suppose that the American Gunfighter, in all of his avatars, is inescapably fetishistic, but (to my point) somewhere along the way-maybe in, uh, 1994?-we crossed over into Something Else.... I can't remember seeing a semi-automatic weapon of any kind at a shooting range until the mid-1980s. Even through the early 1990s, I don't remember the idea of \"personal defense\" being a decisive factor in gun ownership. The reverse is true today: I have college-educated friends-all of whom, interestingly, came to guns in their adult lives-for whom gun ownership is unquestionably (and irreducibly) an issue of personal defense. For whom the semi-automatic rifle or pistol-with its matte-black finish, laser site, flashlight mount, and other \"tactical\" accoutrements-effectively circumscribe what's meant by the word \"gun.\" At least one of these friends has what some folks-e.g., my fiancee, along with most of my non-gun-owning friends-might regard as an obsessive fixation on guns; a kind of paraphilia that (in its appetite for all things tactical) seems not a little bit creepy.

It has what I take to be a very specific use-case, but it's used-liberally-by gun owners outside of the military, outside of law enforcement, outside (if you'll indulge me) of any conceivable reality-based community: these folks talk in terms of \"tactical\" weapons, \"tactical\" scenarios, \"tactical applications,\" and so on. It's the lingua franca of gun shops, gun ranges, gun forums and gun-oriented YouTube videos. (My god, you should see what's out there on YouTube!) Which begs my question: in precisely which \"tactical\" scenarios do all of these lunatics imagine that they're going to use their matte-black, suppressor-fitted, flashlight-ready tactical weapons? They tend to speak of the \"tactical\" as if it were a fait accompli; as a kind of apodeictic fact: as something that everyone-their customers, interlocutors, fellow forum members, or YouTube viewers-experiences on a regular basis, in everyday life. They tend to speak of the tactical as reality. An interesting perspective, and I don't question the accuracy of SS 's observations about his own experience. I do want to argue, however, that the culture he's talking about-the one in which ordinary folk fancy themselves gunslinging avengers, rehearsing for the inevitable \"tactical\" scenario to come-goes back much further. It goes back at least as far as 1967, a time when there were no YouTube videos to document it-in Detroit, for example, where, as I wrote in Nixonland , that year's historic riots touched off preparations among blacks and whites both for something approaching a race war: A local black nationalist minister, Albert Cleage, observed to a reporter that the shooting ranges were packed and the city was way behind in processing gun registrations. \"So naturally, any black man who can get ahold of a gun is getting hold of it.\" A flyer circulated in white neighborhoods: \"Are YOU READY NOW to PREPARE YOURSELF for the NEXT ONE? Or will you be forced to stand helplessly by because you were UN-prepared to defend your home and neighborhood against bands of armed terrorists who will murder the men and rape the women?\" At an outfit called Breakthrough...organized workshops in VFW and Knights of Columbus meeting halls with representatives of the National Rifle Association, who suggested each family stockpile two hundred rounds of ammunition. Ah, yes, the NRA. More on that later, but for now-continuing from Nixonland : The NRA, once a hobby club for sportsman, was becoming a new kind of organization altogether. Its magazine, American Rifleman, had a new column, \"The Armed Citizen,\" which ran glowing accounts of of vigilantes. Connecticut senator Thomas Dodd, a conservative, had a bill pending to limit the sale of firearms through the mail. It had once seemed uncontroversial. Now white and black would-be vigilantes agreed the Dodd bill was a prelude to the confiscation of all firearms. Guns & Ammo called the bills supporters \"criminal-coddling do-gooders, borderline psychotics, as well as Communists and leftists who want to lead us into the one-world welfare state.\" Sound familiar, kiddies? There's nothing new under the wingnut sun. In any event, one of those supporters was Massachusetts' young junior senator, Edward Moore Kennedy, whom the NRA's American Rifleman said was following the \"Communist line\" for trying to outlaw the method by which his brother's assassin had obtained the murder weapon. The tactical turn was well on its way. Much of this information comes from a 1968 Esquire article by Garry Willls that he expanded into a marvelous book of reportage, The Second Civil War: Arming for Armageddon , and from a contemporary Time article you can read here if you're a subscriber; sadly for history buffs and students, Time 's archives used to be, but are no longer, free.) A bit more water would have to flow under the bridge before the transformation of the NRA into a de facto organization by, of and for for aspirant vigilantes would become complete. One historical transformation that contributed: the tactical turn on the left-among white revolutionaries and black power militants-had to die out. It began in earnest in 1966, when Black Panthers began patrolling the streets of the Sunshine State with guns. As I put it in Nixonland : Here was one of the things that made these young men remarkable: beneath their berets and leather jackets, behind their bandoliers, they were also naively earnest. They believed implicitly in the majesty of the law. Revolutionaries in an only-in-America kind of way, they perceived themselves as a fully functioning ghetto constabulatory, apparently suprised when the response of the police-whom they called an \"army of occupation\"-was to wish them dead. \"What are you doing with the guns?\" a patrolman would ask them, a little afraid. 'What are you doing with your gun?\" Huey Newton would shoot back, and pull out one of the law books he always carried with him as other stood by with cameras and tape recorders. (Yes again: nothing new-except the cellphone technology-under the sun.) Huey would step out of his car and snap a live round into his chamber: California law only outlawed the carrying of loaded weapons inside a motor vehicle. Things shifted, of course, when the Panthers started patrolling rich white neighborhoods, including the one where a right-wing supporter of Ronald Reagan in the state assembly, Don Mulford, lived. When the assembly debated Mulford's subsequent bill to ban the carrying of loaded firearms in public places, Panthers strolled onto the floor of the state assembly fully armed. The Mulford Act passed right quick after that-and, ironically, one of the nation's first high-profile gun control laws was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan. (We'll see how ironic in my next post.) Another 1960s scene of left-wing vigilante culture to contemplate: the time a pretty female revolutionary, a former Quaker who had once won a Decency Award from the Kiwanis Club, testified at the Chicago Seven trial about her practice shooting an M1 semiautomatic rifle. Why? the prosecution asked. \"After Chicago I changed from being a pacifist to the realization that we had to defend ourselves. A nonviolent revolution was impossible.\" She spoke, in other words, of the tactical as reality. That left-wing world, of course, is long past. And once the gun nuts were mostly on the right, however, their long march to Capitol Hill hegemony began. In my next post, I'll explain that process, and introduce an antihero into the story, who got involved in this business long before a lot of us knew, a little bit under the radar-long before, that is to say, he became the fortieth president of the United States. Colorado movie theater shooter James Holmes was able to kill twelve people and injure fifty-eight more with an assault rifle in July. George Zornick argues that a few key gun control regulations could have prevented the tragedy.\n\nA lot of what I hope to be doing with this blog I fear might verge on pedantry.

Some of the best coverage and reflection on December 14-the day of the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary-has come from the outstanding folks at Josh Marshall's Talking Points Memo. And part of the mix over at TPM is its reprinting of e-mails from ordinary readers, offering marvelous worm's-eye views and analyses of the issues of the day. Sometimes, however, the worm's-eye view only views what the worm's eye views. On December 15, as the nature of the fearsome arsenal took inside that first grade classroom-the Bushmaster XM-15, the 10mm Glock SF and 9mm SIG Sauer handgun-was becoming apparent, but before, I think, it had been established that the mother he stole the guns from before murdering her may have been a \"full-on\" prepper, arming for Armageddon, TPM printed this interesting e-mail from a reader identified as SS : I was raised with guns. More to the point, my childhood was steeped in gun lore.... I bring this up to establish my bona-fides. The gun culture that we have today in the U.S. is not the gun culture, so to speak, that I remember from my youth. It's too simple to say that it's \"sick\"; it's more accurately an absurd fetishization. I suppose that the American Gunfighter, in all of his avatars, is inescapably fetishistic, but (to my point) somewhere along the way-maybe in, uh, 1994?-we crossed over into Something Else.... I can't remember seeing a semi-automatic weapon of any kind at a shooting range until the mid-1980s. Even through the early 1990s, I don't remember the idea of \"personal defense\" being a decisive factor in gun ownership. The reverse is true today: I have college-educated friends-all of whom, interestingly, came to guns in their adult lives-for whom gun ownership is unquestionably (and irreducibly) an issue of personal defense. For whom the semi-automatic rifle or pistol-with its matte-black finish, laser site, flashlight mount, and other \"tactical\" accoutrements-effectively circumscribe what's meant by the word \"gun.\" At least one of these friends has what some folks-e.g., my fiancee, along with most of my non-gun-owning friends-might regard as an obsessive fixation on guns; a kind of paraphilia that (in its appetite for all things tactical) seems not a little bit creepy.

It has what I take to be a very specific use-case, but it's used-liberally-by gun owners outside of the military, outside of law enforcement, outside (if you'll indulge me) of any conceivable reality-based community: these folks talk in terms of \"tactical\" weapons, \"tactical\" scenarios, \"tactical applications,\" and so on. It's the lingua franca of gun shops, gun ranges, gun forums and gun-oriented YouTube videos. (My god, you should see what's out there on YouTube!) Which begs my question: in precisely which \"tactical\" scenarios do all of these lunatics imagine that they're going to use their matte-black, suppressor-fitted, flashlight-ready tactical weapons? They tend to speak of the \"tactical\" as if it were a fait accompli; as a kind of apodeictic fact: as something that everyone-their customers, interlocutors, fellow forum members, or YouTube viewers-experiences on a regular basis, in everyday life. They tend to speak of the tactical as reality. An interesting perspective, and I don't question the accuracy of SS 's observations about his own experience. I do want to argue, however, that the culture he's talking about-the one in which ordinary folk fancy themselves gunslinging avengers, rehearsing for the inevitable \"tactical\" scenario to come-goes back much further. It goes back at least as far as 1967, a time when there were no YouTube videos to document it-in Detroit, for example, where, as I wrote in Nixonland , that year's historic riots touched off preparations among blacks and whites both for something approaching a race war: A local black nationalist minister, Albert Cleage, observed to a reporter that the shooting ranges were packed and the city was way behind in processing gun registrations. \"So naturally, any black man who can get ahold of a gun is getting hold of it.\" A flyer circulated in white neighborhoods: \"Are YOU READY NOW to PREPARE YOURSELF for the NEXT ONE? Or will you be forced to stand helplessly by because you were UN-prepared to defend your home and neighborhood against bands of armed terrorists who will murder the men and rape the women?\" At an outfit called Breakthrough...organized workshops in VFW and Knights of Columbus meeting halls with representatives of the National Rifle Association, who suggested each family stockpile two hundred rounds of ammunition. Ah, yes, the NRA. More on that later, but for now-continuing from Nixonland : The NRA, once a hobby club for sportsman, was becoming a new kind of organization altogether. Its magazine, American Rifleman, had a new column, \"The Armed Citizen,\" which ran glowing accounts of of vigilantes. Connecticut senator Thomas Dodd, a conservative, had a bill pending to limit the sale of firearms through the mail. It had once seemed uncontroversial. Now white and black would-be vigilantes agreed the Dodd bill was a prelude to the confiscation of all firearms. Guns & Ammo called the bills supporters \"criminal-coddling do-gooders, borderline psychotics, as well as Communists and leftists who want to lead us into the one-world welfare state.\" Sound familiar, kiddies? There's nothing new under the wingnut sun. In any event, one of those supporters was Massachusetts' young junior senator, Edward Moore Kennedy, whom the NRA's American Rifleman said was following the \"Communist line\" for trying to outlaw the method by which his brother's assassin had obtained the murder weapon. The tactical turn was well on its way. Much of this information comes from a 1968 Esquire article by Garry Willls that he expanded into a marvelous book of reportage, The Second Civil War: Arming for Armageddon , and from a contemporary Time article you can read here if you're a subscriber; sadly for history buffs and students, Time 's archives used to be, but are no longer, free.) A bit more water would have to flow under the bridge before the transformation of the NRA into a de facto organization by, of and for for aspirant vigilantes would become complete. One historical transformation that contributed: the tactical turn on the left-among white revolutionaries and black power militants-had to die out. It began in earnest in 1966, when Black Panthers began patrolling the streets of the Sunshine State with guns. As I put it in Nixonland : Here was one of the things that made these young men remarkable: beneath their berets and leather jackets, behind their bandoliers, they were also naively earnest. They believed implicitly in the majesty of the law. Revolutionaries in an only-in-America kind of way, they perceived themselves as a fully functioning ghetto constabulatory, apparently suprised when the response of the police-whom they called an \"army of occupation\"-was to wish them dead. \"What are you doing with the guns?\" a patrolman would ask them, a little afraid. 'What are you doing with your gun?\" Huey Newton would shoot back, and pull out one of the law books he always carried with him as other stood by with cameras and tape recorders. (Yes again: nothing new-except the cellphone technology-under the sun.) Huey would step out of his car and snap a live round into his chamber: California law only outlawed the carrying of loaded weapons inside a motor vehicle. Things shifted, of course, when the Panthers started patrolling rich white neighborhoods, including the one where a right-wing supporter of Ronald Reagan in the state assembly, Don Mulford, lived. When the assembly debated Mulford's subsequent bill to ban the carrying of loaded firearms in public places, Panthers strolled onto the floor of the state assembly fully armed. The Mulford Act passed right quick after that-and, ironically, one of the nation's first high-profile gun control laws was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan. (We'll see how ironic in my next post.) Another 1960s scene of left-wing vigilante culture to contemplate: the time a pretty female revolutionary, a former Quaker who had once won a Decency Award from the Kiwanis Club, testified at the Chicago Seven trial about her practice shooting an M1 semiautomatic rifle. Why? the prosecution asked. \"After Chicago I changed from being a pacifist to the realization that we had to defend ourselves. A nonviolent revolution was impossible.\" She spoke, in other words, of the tactical as reality. That left-wing world, of course, is long past. And once the gun nuts were mostly on the right, however, their long march to Capitol Hill hegemony began. In my next post, I'll explain that process, and introduce an antihero into the story, who got involved in this business long before a lot of us knew, a little bit under the radar-long before, that is to say, he became the fortieth president of the United States. Colorado movie theater shooter James Holmes was able to kill twelve people and injure fifty-eight more with an assault rifle in July.

Activate your online access\n\nIllustration by Tim Robinson.\n\nIn 1931, historian James Truslow Adams published The Epic of America , a one-volume history of the country. At more than 400 pages, it was a formidable volume, but Adams's lyrical prose and insistence on putting everyday people at the center of his narrative drew readers in. They took inspiration from his idea of an \"American dream,\" a phrase he coined for the book and intended as its original title. As Adams saw it, the American dream-the notion that all who lived in the United States would be able to pursue their ambitions \"regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position\"-wasn't empty talk. It had shaped the country's past, and it might well shape its future. Adams wasn't the only one trying to cram the national narrative between two covers; it was a \"crowded field,\" he noted. Writing single-volume overviews of US history was once a venerable tradition, and such masters of the craft as Samuel Eliot Morison, Charles and Mary Beard, and Carl Degler offered their own additions to it. Many have faded with time, but one-Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States , published in 1980-has not. Zinn's history was bleak, a story of the tyranny of the powerful and of the popular movements that fought back. But with the country still smarting from Watergate and the rise of Ronald Reagan portending a new stratification of wealth, the book's themes suited the times. For many readers, it appeared that the mask had finally slipped, that history had been revealed as a violent struggle between the elites and the masses. Books in Review This America: The Case for the Nation By Jill Lepore Buy this book These Truths: A History of the United States By Jill Lepore Buy this book Zinn sought to provide a defiant riposte to the traditional flag-and-freedom histories, but his book has entered the canon. Like The Catcher in the Rye , it's a they're-all-phonies book that, despite itself, now appears regularly on high school syllabi. Though decades old, A People's History still cracks Amazon's list of the 50 best-selling history titles. Stanford University's Sam Wineburg, an expert on history education, says that it \"has arguably had a greater influence on how Americans understand their past than any other single book.\" Yet Zinn's book, perhaps the most successful single-volume history of the United States, also drove a stake through the heart of the enterprise. Seeing the country as divided between oppressors and oppressed, he made little room for common cause, for shared dreams, for even a common history. Indeed, after Zinn the once-crowded field grew bare. It's not just that no subsequent single-volume history has penetrated the national psyche the way Adams's and Zinn's did; it's also that, textbooks aside, few major US historians have attempted the feat. There are still one-volume histories being written but not, by and large, by scholars who profess a lifelong expertise in the subject. At least this was the case until Jill Lepore set out to \"rekindle a lost tradition\" with her nearly 1,000-page tome These Truths: A History of the United States, published in 2018. A Harvard professor, she won the Bancroft Prize, one of the most prestigious awards in the field, for her first book, The Name of War . The last 10 winners whose ages I could determine won the Bancroft, on average, in their late 50s; Lepore won it at 33 and has been virtually unstoppable ever since. Her colleagues in Harvard's history department have written an average of three scholarly books apiece; she has written 11. She's also cofounded a journal, coauthored a novel, and served on the staff of The New Yorker , for which she has written more than 100 pieces on topics ranging from Frankenstein to management theory. What is most impressive is that, in this white heat of research and writing, her work has been, well, conspicuously and reliably good.

Her fans attest to weeping over These Truths , and I'll confess to feeling a prelachrymal lump in my throat more than once while reading it. The story of Thomas Jefferson and his enslaved consort Sally Hemings isn't news. Yet reading Lepore's rendition of it, in which the tragedy of slavery cries out with an almost unbearable poignancy, is like watching a virtuoso pianist set to work on the \"Moonlight\" Sonata. You've heard the piece a thousand times; you just never quite appreciated how rich it was. But what do these deftly narrated stories add up to? Lepore is coy about announcing a thesis. Her flavorless title, These Truths , does less to guide the reader than Zinn's pugnacious A People's History of the United States or Adams's intended, evocative The American Dream . She is fascinated by political discourse, questions of inclusion, and communication technologies, yet it is only with her follow-up book-a short volume bearing the (similarly bland) title This America -that we clearly see how they connect. In the new book, Lepore shows her hand, revealing the political commitments that impelled her to write These Truths and that shape her worldview and approach to history. Current Issue View our current issue This America announces its intentions on the very first page. It is, she writes, an argument for \"the enduring importance of the United States and of American civic ideals.\" Those words may sound tepid, but they are, for Lepore, a declaration of a multifront war. Against scholars who have become too enamored with far-reaching global histories of capitalism and empire or too tightly focused on subnational identity groups, Lepore sternly redirects attention to the nation, a single people united by common experience. Against the \"postmodernism\" that she says has \"suffused\" politics-a Fox News right crying \"fake news\" and a millennial left that, she claims, locates epistemic authority in personal identity-Lepore stands for the reasonableness of the center. She's for free speech, civil debate, democratic processes, and love of country. Like Zinn, Lepore has written a soup-to-nuts history of the country. But unlike Zinn, she doesn't regard it as an us-versus-them story. Instead, she likens the nation to a ship that is barely still afloat. As liberalism's enemies pull up the planking to light \"bonfires of rage,\" patriots must mend the listing vessel before it tilts into the \"doom-black sea.\" Her history is itself intended as an act of repair. In the face of the forces rending the United States, Lepore depicts it as a unitary society with a distinct and laudable set of civic ideals, one whose past can be intelligibly told as a single story.

Randall Kennedy Zadie Smith's Turn to Short Fiction Rumaan Alam Jonathan Safran Foer and the Limits of Liberal Climate Politics Kate Aronoff S ingle stories are unfashionable at present. Historians today are relentless pluralizers, far more inclined to write the histories of modernities than the history of modernity. They have good reason(s). The more the field grows-new research, new perspectives-the harder it becomes for writers to agree on a central narrative. Two tendencies in particular have turned US history into a forest of tangled branches. The first is diversification: As their ranks have grown more heterogeneous, historians have consciously sought to offer accounts that aren't narrated solely from the implicit vantage of well-off white men. The second is globalization: The acceleration of flows of ideas, people, and things across borders in recent decades has called into question what \"the United States\" even means and whether its history can be hived off and told apart from that of the rest of the world. With regard to history's diversification, Lepore is warmly receptive. Having written a biography of Jane Franklin, Benjamin Franklin's lesser-known sister, Lepore is practiced at opening up the past so that it is not just the story of presidents and generals. On this score, These Truths excels. The American Revolution, for Lepore, stars not only George Washington but also Harry Washington, who toiled in slavery on the founder's plantation. Harry Washington escaped twice, fought with the British in the Revolution (while \"wearing a white sash stitched with the motto 'Liberty to Slaves'\"), and sailed for Sierra Leone, where he led his own revolt against the colonial government. Similarly, Lepore's version of the civil rights movement features, alongside Martin Luther King Jr., Pauli Murray, the brilliant intellectual and tactician whose contributions were likely kept quiet because Murray, born with female genitalia, identified as male. One of the great achievements of These Truths , in fact, is how tightly it weaves the Harry Washingtons and Pauli Murrays into its tapestry. Lepore includes them not dutifully but eagerly and to great effect. And by taking both Harry Washington and George Washington seriously at the same time, she compellingly demonstrates that writing an inclusive history needn't require splitting the past into separate histories \"divided by race, sex, or class,\" as Lepore contends many of her colleagues do. Related Article Eric Hobsbawm's Many Lefts David Marcus The second change that has fractured national narratives-globalization-is a more complicated story. Living with porous borders has led historians to recognize that the past isn't served up neatly in national containers. Borders, they argue, have never been as fixed and straightforward as maps suggest-and events have a way of spilling over them anyway. It's for this reason that historians increasingly study empires, borderlands, diasporas, oceans, trade networks, climatic zones, and other transnational entities rather than countries, as they used to all do. This is where Lepore draws the line: \"This world is a world of nations,\" she insists. These Truths is thus a resolutely national history, concerned with what takes place inside US borders, not beyond them. Lepore recognizes diversity within those boundary lines-the nation contains many kinds and colors-but she nevertheless consistently interprets that diversity as part of a shared national heritage. There is something admirably inclusive about Lepore's vision of the country as a diverse nation, but there is something restricting about it, too. After These Truths appeared, historian Christine DeLucia and other critics noticed that Lepore had made little room in her story for Native Americans, especially in the latter half. She acknowledged this and has added material to the paperback edition. Yet from reading This America , it's easy to see why indigenous peoples initially played a small role in her story. These Truths is the history of a nation, which Lepore defines as a \"political community\" that joins people \"as if they were a family.\" Native Americans, who have often defined themselves (and been defined in federal law) as nations apart from the United States, do not easily fit within her frame. They have been and continue to be an integral part of the country, but they haven't uniformly sought membership in the US nation, in what she calls the \"community of belonging and commitment.\" In This America , Lepore reckons with the presence of tribal nations within the United States. \"The struggle for native nationhood,\" she writes, helps to \"constitute the nation in much the same way that debates over the Constitution constitute the nation. They challenge the nation to live up to its ideals.\" This is fine as far as it goes, but notice what she has done in making such an assertion: To force indigenous demands for sovereignty into the frame of US national history, she's reinterpreted them as internal dissent, as part of a rich debate about how to achieve shared national goals. She's turned a country containing multiple nations into a single diverse nation. The problem is that seeing the \"struggle for native nationhood\" as a bid to help the US nation \"live up to its ideals\"-Lepore likens it to the civil rights movement-is to miss the point. Overseas territories are another blind spot, another part of the country that doesn't fit Lepore's nation-centered approach. By 1940, about 19 million people lived in the United States' colonies, meaning that one-eighth of the US population lived not in the States but in the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, American Samoa, or the US Virgin Islands. Yet major events in the country's colonial history, such as the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy or the Puerto Rican nationalist uprising of 1950 (which included an assassination attempt on Harry Truman), don't merit mention in These Truths . The Philippine War, which might have killed more US nationals than the American Civil War, appears briefly, but in Lepore's telling, it matters more for how it reflected and affected race relations in North America than for what it did to the Philippines. Lepore's national frame consistently directs her readers' gaze inward; it's the history of a \"we.\" She rightly has an inclusive understanding of that \"we,\" but she exhibits little interest in anything outside of it. The Vietnam War, which split the nation, consumes Lepore's attention. The Korean War, which didn't, she barely mentions, even though it permanently divided the Korean Peninsula and may have taken as many Asian lives as the Vietnam War did. Lepore writes ably and critically about the George W. Bush administration's Global War on Terrorism, yet she is more concerned with how the use of torture violated long-standing norms and tarnished national morals than she is with the far more consequential destabilization of the Middle East. Such far-off consequences of US actions are beyond Lepore's remit. In writing These Truths , she confined herself to \"what, in my view, a people constituted as a nation in the early twenty-first century need to know about their own past.\" That sounds sensible. But given that the nation in question is also an empire-with Native American reservations, overseas territories, and hundreds of military bases spread across the planet-perhaps its members should also know a little about the other peoples and pasts this empire has engrossed. They, too, are US history. T here's a reason Lepore doubles down on the nation-on the \"we\"-and it's not that she's ignorant of other approaches. While her colleagues are embarking on their free-form jazz odysseys, decentering the nation by writing books about oceans, most readers still see the world in terms of nations, and they want history written accordingly. \"They can get it from scholars or they can get it from demagogues, but get it they will,\" Lepore warns. She has a point. \"Serious historians,\" as Lepore calls them, are reluctant to deliver single-volume national histories or accounts of the powerful men and wars that shaped the country, but that hasn't stopped the less serious. \"America's bestselling historian,\" according to his publisher, is not a learned professor but former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. His wildly popular Killing series ( Killing Lincoln , Killing Kennedy , Killing Reagan , etc.), coauthored with Martin Dugard, offers national history in its familiar Father's Day form, just with more gore and less accuracy. Joining O'Reilly and Dugard atop the New York Times best-seller list are Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen, authors of the counter-Zinnian A Patriot's History of the United States . Schweikart can be found these days on Twitter, offering edifying thoughts about the \"DemoKKKrats.\" Driving the demagogues out of the Barnes & Noble will require more than just taking back the nation as an object of serious historical inquiry. Lepore also sees a need to show that object in a more flattering light. Whereas many of her colleagues narrate US history as a tragedy and a chronicle of oppression, Lepore sets out to capture a fuller range of feeling. Her version features \"a great deal of anguish,\" she admits, but it also contains \"decency and hope,\" \"prosperity and ambition,\" \"invention and beauty.\" Lepore's relatively upbeat tone is more than a sensibility; it's a politics. The Bill O'Reillys of the bookshelf, she insists in This America , have not only taken control of the national story but also claimed for themselves the mantle of patriotism. Lepore wants to take it back for liberals. O'Reilly and his ilk are, in her view, best described not as patriots but as nationalists using the flag as a cloak for their illiberal agendas. True patriots, those who cherish the liberal values of the country, must stand and be counted. Lepore's distinction-\"patriotism is animated by love, nationalism by hatred\"-is not one that holds up well under scrutiny, but her point is clear enough. She hopes that she can tell US history in an inclusive way, staring the cruelties of the past full in the face yet coming out of it with her faith in the country intact. This determination not to cede love of country to the nationalists supplies Lepore with a creed. \"The United States,\" she insists, \"is a nation founded on a deeply moral commitment to human dignity\" and to the proposition that \"all of us are equal.\" What's noteworthy here is not Lepore's celebration of dignity and equality; it's her insistence that such values lie at the core of the United States and always have. But that claim, essential to her patriotism, is hard to square with history. We now have a much better understanding of how central patriarchy, the Indian Wars, and slavery were to the country's founding, and Lepore denies none of this. (She writes that George Washington attended the Constitutional Convention wearing \"dentures made from ivory and from nine teeth pulled from the mouths of his slaves.\") Yet her faith is dauntless. \"Notwithstanding the agony and hypocrisy of the nation's past,\" she insists, \"these truths endure.\" T hese truths endure . Lepore's devotion to the country's core values is a major part of This America . She twice quotes historian Michael Kazin's point that radicals and reformers succeed in the United States only when they appeal to what he calls \"the national belief system.\" Lepore has little patience for those who fail to heed Kazin's advice, for the reformers and radicals who see that the national belief system as an impediment to equality rather than an instrument for achieving it. In These Truths , this comes out particularly clearly in Lepore's treatment of the Black Power movement, which she narrates through the figure of Stokely Carmichael. He began his career with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, as someone for whom political action meant registering voters. But by 1966 he had given up on reforms secured within the existing frame of US politics. \"The reality is that this nation, from top to bottom, is racist,\" he wrote in The New York Review of Books . \"We won't fight to save the present society.\" Lepore regards this position as reckless. She explains that his star wasn't the only one rising; this was also an era when a newly emboldened right emerged. When Carmichael received an invitation in 1966 to speak at the University of California, Berkeley, a California gubernatorial candidate named Ronald Reagan seized on it as a chance to bolster his own campaign. \"We cannot have the university campus used as a base from which to foment riots,\" Reagan declared. Predictably, Carmichael refused to back down, and in so doing, he \"played right into Reagan's hands,\" Lepore laments. The Republican candidate used Carmichael's speech as a wedge issue and won the election handily, triumphing in 55 out of California's 58 counties. It was, she writes with palpable irritation, \"a victory of conservatives over liberals.\" Lepore's pairing of Carmichael and Reagan is telling. Other historians charting the rise of the right have invoked such structural and economic factors as white flight to the suburbs and the rise of corporate-funded think tanks. Her narrative stresses what she views as the ill-advised intransigence of the left. \"With each new form of public protest, Reagan's political capital grew,\" she explains. As campus activists \"descended into disenchantment and a profound alienation from the idea of America itself,\" Republicans fed off that disenchantment. Conservatism surged, she writes, when liberalism faltered because \"the idea of identity replaced the idea of equality.\" We are now risking imminent collapse, Lepore insists. \"The nation has been coming apart.\" One horseman of the apocalypse is the right-wing radio host Alex Jones, who consumes so much of her attention that a reader unfamiliar with history might conclude from These Truths that his arrival in politics was more momentous than the Korean War. Certainly, Jones is a perfect villain for Lepore: Not only is he malicious, but he openly scorns any shared national project. But other illiberal horsemen stalk the land as well. Lepore sounds the alarm over \"left identity politics,\" particularly the campus-based \"alt-left\" (here she uses a Breitbart -favored pejorative), which she regards as comparable to the alt-right. She decries the left's \"meaningless outrage\" and \"sanctimonious accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.\" As an illustration, she describes a Twitter squabble. \"After fourteen people were killed in a terrorist attack on a gay nightclub in San Bernardino, California,\" she writes, \"the alt-left spent its energies in the aftermath of this tragedy attacking one another for breaches of the rules of 'intersectionality,' which involve intricate, identity-based hierarchies of suffering and virtue.\" Twitter users, she continues, responded to the news by angrily correcting newscasters who described the attack as the worst massacre in US history (that would be Wounded Knee, they insisted) and arguing about whether it was ableist to blame the shooting on mental illness. This is a caricature and an uncharacteristically mean one for Lepore, who typically treats her subjects with sympathy. Her account comes secondhand from Angela Nagle's Kill All Normies , and Lepore's garbling of it-conflating the attack on the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino with the mass shooting at Pulse in Orlando, Florida-strongly suggests that she hasn't read the offending tweets herself. I have. They seem far more calm and reasoned in context, and I saw no evidence that they consumed the \"energies\" of the left or set off cascading wokeness competitions. What is more, in reducing the younger left to these tweets, Lepore overlooks its bold environmental and economic agendas. At a time when progressive millennials are achieving extraordinary political success pushing programs like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, Lepore sees them as largely feckless, more likely to sink the ship than steer it. What young leftists fail to recognize, she continues, is how fragile the nation has become. In the decade before the Civil War, New York Senator William Seward warned of an \"irrepressible conflict\" brewing. Lepore quotes him when describing the sharpening of political knives that has been ongoing since the Reagan administration: The 2016 election \"nearly rent the nation in two,\" she writes. Holding it together will require repudiating extremism, affirming core values, and grabbing tight hold of the nation. \"Whether nations can remain liberal,\" she counsels, \"actually depends on the recovery of the many ways of understanding what it means to belong to a nation, and even to love a nation, the place, the people, and the idea itself.\" T he \"irrepressible conflict\" of which Seward warned killed hundreds of thousands, yet it also ended slavery. The war's two faces illustrate the big question at the center of Lepore's view of US history. For her, the United States has professed democratic equality from the start. There is no shortage of what she calls \"hypocrisy\"-the failure to live up to announced values-in its past. But progress has only ever been achieved by affirming the nation and those core values. That is the liberal view, and Lepore isn't alone in seeing things that way. Yet radicals tend to have a different understanding. In their view, the United States-a settler empire carved out of Native lands by rich white men, many of whom enslaved others-was not particularly egalitarian in its origins. If it's a better society today, this is because activists made seemingly unrealistic demands and fought for them. Stark conflict has been essential to progress, and the times of greatest national division-the 1860s, the 1960s and '70s-have also been times of major progressive victories like the abolition of slavery and the establishment of reproductive rights. For a radical, this is not the time to mend rifts or make compromises. It's a time of crisis-and when it comes to the threat of global warming, an existential one. It's also a rare chance to achieve root-and-branch change with regard to the environment, the economy, gender, sexuality, and race. If what is needed is an overhaul rather than an adjustment, then the ideals and methods of 18th century men-\"these truths\"-may not be the best guides. Lepore doesn't disavow radical aims, so her case for nation-centered histories and liberal patriotism is tactical. Global solidarities and widened horizons are fine to contemplate, but there's a reason that books about the nation sell best. To reject the nation is to give up on reaching an audience, on making a difference. Similarly, in her view, radical intentions are laudable, but radical political programs that condemn the nation backfire and inadvertently aid the enemy. In the end, she argues, it is liberals, not radicals, who can deliver progressive change. They do so using the most powerful tool within reach: the nation. The problem is that Lepore is preaching this liberal gospel in increasingly radical times. The Trump presidency and the climate crisis have raised sharp challenges to her worldview. She finds herself in the awkward position of espousing patriotism at a moment of cruel nationalism, of explaining why radicalism doesn't work at just the time radicals on all sides are gaining clout, and of insisting that the nation is the most relevant geographical unit while storms, droughts, and heat waves make a mockery of political borders. In the face of such challenges, Lepore stands firm: The nation and its founding values are a shared heritage, and we must hold fast to them. The epic history she has written from this position is an important one, further evidence (if any were needed) of her prodigious powers. Yet it's hard not to wonder, as the evidence mounts daily that the old rules no longer apply, if the ground that Lepore is digging her heels into isn't an ice shelf, melting beneath her feet.\n\nAdams wasn't the only one trying to cram the national narrative between two covers; it was a \"crowded field,\" he noted. Writing single-volume overviews of US history was once a venerable tradition, and such masters of the craft as Samuel Eliot Morison, Charles and Mary Beard, and Carl Degler offered their own additions to it. Many have faded with time, but one-Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States , published in 1980-has not. Zinn's history was bleak, a story of the tyranny of the powerful and of the popular movements that fought back. But with the country still smarting from Watergate and the rise of Ronald Reagan portending a new stratification of wealth, the book's themes suited the times. For many readers, it appeared that the mask had finally slipped, that history had been revealed as a violent struggle between the elites and the masses. Books in Review This America: The Case for the Nation By Jill Lepore Buy this book These Truths: A History of the United States By Jill Lepore Buy this book Zinn sought to provide a defiant riposte to the traditional flag-and-freedom histories, but his book has entered the canon. Like The Catcher in the Rye , it's a they're-all-phonies book that, despite itself, now appears regularly on high school syllabi. Though decades old, A People's History still cracks Amazon's list of the 50 best-selling history titles. Stanford University's Sam Wineburg, an expert on history education, says that it \"has arguably had a greater influence on how Americans understand their past than any other single book.\" Yet Zinn's book, perhaps the most successful single-volume history of the United States, also drove a stake through the heart of the enterprise. Seeing the country as divided between oppressors and oppressed, he made little room for common cause, for shared dreams, for even a common history. Indeed, after Zinn the once-crowded field grew bare. It's not just that no subsequent single-volume history has penetrated the national psyche the way Adams's and Zinn's did; it's also that, textbooks aside, few major US historians have attempted the feat. There are still one-volume histories being written but not, by and large, by scholars who profess a lifelong expertise in the subject. At least this was the case until Jill Lepore set out to \"rekindle a lost tradition\" with her nearly 1,000-page tome These Truths: A History of the United States, published in 2018. A Harvard professor, she won the Bancroft Prize, one of the most prestigious awards in the field, for her first book, The Name of War . The last 10 winners whose ages I could determine won the Bancroft, on average, in their late 50s; Lepore won it at 33 and has been virtually unstoppable ever since. Her colleagues in Harvard's history department have written an average of three scholarly books apiece; she has written 11. She's also cofounded a journal, coauthored a novel, and served on the staff of The New Yorker , for which she has written more than 100 pieces on topics ranging from Frankenstein to management theory. What is most impressive is that, in this white heat of research and writing, her work has been, well, conspicuously and reliably good.

Her fans attest to weeping over These Truths , and I'll confess to feeling a prelachrymal lump in my throat more than once while reading it. The story of Thomas Jefferson and his enslaved consort Sally Hemings isn't news. Yet reading Lepore's rendition of it, in which the tragedy of slavery cries out with an almost unbearable poignancy, is like watching a virtuoso pianist set to work on the \"Moonlight\" Sonata. You've heard the piece a thousand times; you just never quite appreciated how rich it was. But what do these deftly narrated stories add up to? Lepore is coy about announcing a thesis. Her flavorless title, These Truths , does less to guide the reader than Zinn's pugnacious A People's History of the United States or Adams's intended, evocative The American Dream . She is fascinated by political discourse, questions of inclusion, and communication technologies, yet it is only with her follow-up book-a short volume bearing the (similarly bland) title This America -that we clearly see how they connect. In the new book, Lepore shows her hand, revealing the political commitments that impelled her to write These Truths and that shape her worldview and approach to history. Current Issue View our current issue This America announces its intentions on the very first page. It is, she writes, an argument for \"the enduring importance of the United States and of American civic ideals.\" Those words may sound tepid, but they are, for Lepore, a declaration of a multifront war. Against scholars who have become too enamored with far-reaching global histories of capitalism and empire or too tightly focused on subnational identity groups, Lepore sternly redirects attention to the nation, a single people united by common experience. Against the \"postmodernism\" that she says has \"suffused\" politics-a Fox News right crying \"fake news\" and a millennial left that, she claims, locates epistemic authority in personal identity-Lepore stands for the reasonableness of the center. She's for free speech, civil debate, democratic processes, and love of country. Like Zinn, Lepore has written a soup-to-nuts history of the country. But unlike Zinn, she doesn't regard it as an us-versus-them story. Instead, she likens the nation to a ship that is barely still afloat. As liberalism's enemies pull up the planking to light \"bonfires of rage,\" patriots must mend the listing vessel before it tilts into the \"doom-black sea.\" Her history is itself intended as an act of repair. In the face of the forces rending the United States, Lepore depicts it as a unitary society with a distinct and laudable set of civic ideals, one whose past can be intelligibly told as a single story.

Randall Kennedy Zadie Smith's Turn to Short Fiction Rumaan Alam Jonathan Safran Foer and the Limits of Liberal Climate Politics Kate Aronoff S ingle stories are unfashionable at present. Historians today are relentless pluralizers, far more inclined to write the histories of modernities than the history of modernity. They have good reason(s). The more the field grows-new research, new perspectives-the harder it becomes for writers to agree on a central narrative. Two tendencies in particular have turned US history into a forest of tangled branches. The first is diversification: As their ranks have grown more heterogeneous, historians have consciously sought to offer accounts that aren't narrated solely from the implicit vantage of well-off white men. The second is globalization: The acceleration of flows of ideas, people, and things across borders in recent decades has called into question what \"the United States\" even means and whether its history can be hived off and told apart from that of the rest of the world. With regard to history's diversification, Lepore is warmly receptive. Having written a biography of Jane Franklin, Benjamin Franklin's lesser-known sister, Lepore is practiced at opening up the past so that it is not just the story of presidents and generals. On this score, These Truths excels. The American Revolution, for Lepore, stars not only George Washington but also Harry Washington, who toiled in slavery on the founder's plantation. Harry Washington escaped twice, fought with the British in the Revolution (while \"wearing a white sash stitched with the motto 'Liberty to Slaves'\"), and sailed for Sierra Leone, where he led his own revolt against the colonial government. Similarly, Lepore's version of the civil rights movement features, alongside Martin Luther King Jr., Pauli Murray, the brilliant intellectual and tactician whose contributions were likely kept quiet because Murray, born with female genitalia, identified as male. One of the great achievements of These Truths , in fact, is how tightly it weaves the Harry Washingtons and Pauli Murrays into its tapestry. Lepore includes them not dutifully but eagerly and to great effect. And by taking both Harry Washington and George Washington seriously at the same time, she compellingly demonstrates that writing an inclusive history needn't require splitting the past into separate histories \"divided by race, sex, or class,\" as Lepore contends many of her colleagues do. Related Article Eric Hobsbawm's Many Lefts David Marcus The second change that has fractured national narratives-globalization-is a more complicated story. Living with porous borders has led historians to recognize that the past isn't served up neatly in national containers. Borders, they argue, have never been as fixed and straightforward as maps suggest-and events have a way of spilling over them anyway. It's for this reason that historians increasingly study empires, borderlands, diasporas, oceans, trade networks, climatic zones, and other transnational entities rather than countries, as they used to all do. This is where Lepore draws the line: \"This world is a world of nations,\" she insists. These Truths is thus a resolutely national history, concerned with what takes place inside US borders, not beyond them. Lepore recognizes diversity within those boundary lines-the nation contains many kinds and colors-but she nevertheless consistently interprets that diversity as part of a shared national heritage. There is something admirably inclusive about Lepore's vision of the country as a diverse nation, but there is something restricting about it, too. After These Truths appeared, historian Christine DeLucia and other critics noticed that Lepore had made little room in her story for Native Americans, especially in the latter half. She acknowledged this and has added material to the paperback edition. Yet from reading This America , it's easy to see why indigenous peoples initially played a small role in her story. These Truths is the history of a nation, which Lepore defines as a \"political community\" that joins people \"as if they were a family.\" Native Americans, who have often defined themselves (and been defined in federal law) as nations apart from the United States, do not easily fit within her frame. They have been and continue to be an integral part of the country, but they haven't uniformly sought membership in the US nation, in what she calls the \"community of belonging and commitment.\" In This America , Lepore reckons with the presence of tribal nations within the United States. \"The struggle for native nationhood,\" she writes, helps to \"constitute the nation in much the same way that debates over the Constitution constitute the nation. They challenge the nation to live up to its ideals.\" This is fine as far as it goes, but notice what she has done in making such an assertion: To force indigenous demands for sovereignty into the frame of US national history, she's reinterpreted them as internal dissent, as part of a rich debate about how to achieve shared national goals. She's turned a country containing multiple nations into a single diverse nation. The problem is that seeing the \"struggle for native nationhood\" as a bid to help the US nation \"live up to its ideals\"-Lepore likens it to the civil rights movement-is to miss the point. Overseas territories are another blind spot, another part of the country that doesn't fit Lepore's nation-centered approach. By 1940, about 19 million people lived in the United States' colonies, meaning that one-eighth of the US population lived not in the States but in the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, American Samoa, or the US Virgin Islands. Yet major events in the country's colonial history, such as the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy or the Puerto Rican nationalist uprising of 1950 (which included an assassination attempt on Harry Truman), don't merit mention in These Truths . The Philippine War, which might have killed more US nationals than the American Civil War, appears briefly, but in Lepore's telling, it matters more for how it reflected and affected race relations in North America than for what it did to the Philippines. Lepore's national frame consistently directs her readers' gaze inward; it's the history of a \"we.\" She rightly has an inclusive understanding of that \"we,\" but she exhibits little interest in anything outside of it. The Vietnam War, which split the nation, consumes Lepore's attention. The Korean War, which didn't, she barely mentions, even though it permanently divided the Korean Peninsula and may have taken as many Asian lives as the Vietnam War did. Lepore writes ably and critically about the George W. Bush administration's Global War on Terrorism, yet she is more concerned with how the use of torture violated long-standing norms and tarnished national morals than she is with the far more consequential destabilization of the Middle East. Such far-off consequences of US actions are beyond Lepore's remit. In writing These Truths , she confined herself to \"what, in my view, a people constituted as a nation in the early twenty-first century need to know about their own past.\" That sounds sensible. But given that the nation in question is also an empire-with Native American reservations, overseas territories, and hundreds of military bases spread across the planet-perhaps its members should also know a little about the other peoples and pasts this empire has engrossed. They, too, are US history. T here's a reason Lepore doubles down on the nation-on the \"we\"-and it's not that she's ignorant of other approaches. While her colleagues are embarking on their free-form jazz odysseys, decentering the nation by writing books about oceans, most readers still see the world in terms of nations, and they want history written accordingly. \"They can get it from scholars or they can get it from demagogues, but get it they will,\" Lepore warns. She has a point. \"Serious historians,\" as Lepore calls them, are reluctant to deliver single-volume national histories or accounts of the powerful men and wars that shaped the country, but that hasn't stopped the less serious. \"America's bestselling historian,\" according to his publisher, is not a learned professor but former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. His wildly popular Killing series ( Killing Lincoln , Killing Kennedy , Killing Reagan , etc.), coauthored with Martin Dugard, offers national history in its familiar Father's Day form, just with more gore and less accuracy. Joining O'Reilly and Dugard atop the New York Times best-seller list are Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen, authors of the counter-Zinnian A Patriot's History of the United States . Schweikart can be found these days on Twitter, offering edifying thoughts about the \"DemoKKKrats.\" Driving the demagogues out of the Barnes & Noble will require more than just taking back the nation as an object of serious historical inquiry. Lepore also sees a need to show that object in a more flattering light. Whereas many of her colleagues narrate US history as a tragedy and a chronicle of oppression, Lepore sets out to capture a fuller range of feeling. Her version features \"a great deal of anguish,\" she admits, but it also contains \"decency and hope,\" \"prosperity and ambition,\" \"invention and beauty.\" Lepore's relatively upbeat tone is more than a sensibility; it's a politics. The Bill O'Reillys of the bookshelf, she insists in This America , have not only taken control of the national story but also claimed for themselves the mantle of patriotism. Lepore wants to take it back for liberals. O'Reilly and his ilk are, in her view, best described not as patriots but as nationalists using the flag as a cloak for their illiberal agendas. True patriots, those who cherish the liberal values of the country, must stand and be counted. Lepore's distinction-\"patriotism is animated by love, nationalism by hatred\"-is not one that holds up well under scrutiny, but her point is clear enough. She hopes that she can tell US history in an inclusive way, staring the cruelties of the past full in the face yet coming out of it with her faith in the country intact. This determination not to cede love of country to the nationalists supplies Lepore with a creed. \"The United States,\" she insists, \"is a nation founded on a deeply moral commitment to human dignity\" and to the proposition that \"all of us are equal.\" What's noteworthy here is not Lepore's celebration of dignity and equality; it's her insistence that such values lie at the core of the United States and always have. But that claim, essential to her patriotism, is hard to square with history. We now have a much better understanding of how central patriarchy, the Indian Wars, and slavery were to the country's founding, and Lepore denies none of this. (She writes that George Washington attended the Constitutional Convention wearing \"dentures made from ivory and from nine teeth pulled from the mouths of his slaves.\") Yet her faith is dauntless. \"Notwithstanding the agony and hypocrisy of the nation's past,\" she insists, \"these truths endure.\" T hese truths endure .

She finds herself in the awkward position of espousing patriotism at a moment of cruel nationalism, of explaining why radicalism doesn't work at just the time radicals on all sides are gaining clout, and of insisting that the nation is the most relevant geographical unit while storms, droughts, and heat waves make a mockery of political borders. In the face of such challenges, Lepore stands firm: The nation and its founding values are a shared heritage, and we must hold fast to them. The epic history she has written from this position is an important one, further evidence (if any were needed) of her prodigious powers.

Like The Catcher in the Rye , it's a they're-all-phonies book that, despite itself, now appears regularly on high school syllabi. Though decades old, A People's History still cracks Amazon's list of the 50 best-selling history titles. Stanford University's Sam Wineburg, an expert on history education, says that it \"has arguably had a greater influence on how Americans understand their past than any other single book.\" Yet Zinn's book, perhaps the most successful single-volume history of the United States, also drove a stake through the heart of the enterprise. Seeing the country as divided between oppressors and oppressed, he made little room for common cause, for shared dreams, for even a common history. Indeed, after Zinn the once-crowded field grew bare. It's not just that no subsequent single-volume history has penetrated the national psyche the way Adams's and Zinn's did; it's also that, textbooks aside, few major US historians have attempted the feat. There are still one-volume histories being written but not, by and large, by scholars who profess a lifelong expertise in the subject. At least this was the case until Jill Lepore set out to \"rekindle a lost tradition\" with her nearly 1,000-page tome These Truths: A History of the United States, published in 2018. A Harvard professor, she won the Bancroft Prize, one of the most prestigious awards in the field, for her first book, The Name of War . The last 10 winners whose ages I could determine won the Bancroft, on average, in their late 50s; Lepore won it at 33 and has been virtually unstoppable ever since. Her colleagues in Harvard's history department have written an average of three scholarly books apiece; she has written 11. She's also cofounded a journal, coauthored a novel, and served on the staff of The New Yorker , for which she has written more than 100 pieces on topics ranging from Frankenstein to management theory. What is most impressive is that, in this white heat of research and writing, her work has been, well, conspicuously and reliably good.

Historians today are relentless pluralizers, far more inclined to write the histories of modernities than the history of modernity. They have good reason(s). The more the field grows-new research, new perspectives-the harder it becomes for writers to agree on a central narrative. Two tendencies in particular have turned US history into a forest of tangled branches. The first is diversification: As their ranks have grown more heterogeneous, historians have consciously sought to offer accounts that aren't narrated solely from the implicit vantage of well-off white men. The second is globalization: The acceleration of flows of ideas, people, and things across borders in recent decades has called into question what \"the United States\" even means and whether its history can be hived off and told apart from that of the rest of the world. With regard to history's diversification, Lepore is warmly receptive. Having written a biography of Jane Franklin, Benjamin Franklin's lesser-known sister, Lepore is practiced at opening up the past so that it is not just the story of presidents and generals. On this score, These Truths excels. The American Revolution, for Lepore, stars not only George Washington but also Harry Washington, who toiled in slavery on the founder's plantation. Harry Washington escaped twice, fought with the British in the Revolution (while \"wearing a white sash stitched with the motto 'Liberty to Slaves'\"), and sailed for Sierra Leone, where he led his own revolt against the colonial government. Similarly, Lepore's version of the civil rights movement features, alongside Martin Luther King Jr., Pauli Murray, the brilliant intellectual and tactician whose contributions were likely kept quiet because Murray, born with female genitalia, identified as male. One of the great achievements of These Truths , in fact, is how tightly it weaves the Harry Washingtons and Pauli Murrays into its tapestry. Lepore includes them not dutifully but eagerly and to great effect. And by taking both Harry Washington and George Washington seriously at the same time, she compellingly demonstrates that writing an inclusive history needn't require splitting the past into separate histories \"divided by race, sex, or class,\" as Lepore contends many of her colleagues do. Related Article Eric Hobsbawm's Many Lefts David Marcus The second change that has fractured national narratives-globalization-is a more complicated story. Living with porous borders has led historians to recognize that the past isn't served up neatly in national containers. Borders, they argue, have never been as fixed and straightforward as maps suggest-and events have a way of spilling over them anyway. It's for this reason that historians increasingly study empires, borderlands, diasporas, oceans, trade networks, climatic zones, and other transnational entities rather than countries, as they used to all do. This is where Lepore draws the line: \"This world is a world of nations,\" she insists. These Truths is thus a resolutely national history, concerned with what takes place inside US borders, not beyond them. Lepore recognizes diversity within those boundary lines-the nation contains many kinds and colors-but she nevertheless consistently interprets that diversity as part of a shared national heritage. There is something admirably inclusive about Lepore's vision of the country as a diverse nation, but there is something restricting about it, too. After These Truths appeared, historian Christine DeLucia and other critics noticed that Lepore had made little room in her story for Native Americans, especially in the latter half. She acknowledged this and has added material to the paperback edition. Yet from reading This America , it's easy to see why indigenous peoples initially played a small role in her story. These Truths is the history of a nation, which Lepore defines as a \"political community\" that joins people \"as if they were a family.\" Native Americans, who have often defined themselves (and been defined in federal law) as nations apart from the United States, do not easily fit within her frame. They have been and continue to be an integral part of the country, but they haven't uniformly sought membership in the US nation, in what she calls the \"community of belonging and commitment.\" In This America , Lepore reckons with the presence of tribal nations within the United States. \"The struggle for native nationhood,\" she writes, helps to \"constitute the nation in much the same way that debates over the Constitution constitute the nation. They challenge the nation to live up to its ideals.\" This is fine as far as it goes, but notice what she has done in making such an assertion: To force indigenous demands for sovereignty into the frame of US national history, she's reinterpreted them as internal dissent, as part of a rich debate about how to achieve shared national goals. She's turned a country containing multiple nations into a single diverse nation. The problem is that seeing the \"struggle for native nationhood\" as a bid to help the US nation \"live up to its ideals\"-Lepore likens it to the civil rights movement-is to miss the point. Overseas territories are another blind spot, another part of the country that doesn't fit Lepore's nation-centered approach. By 1940, about 19 million people lived in the United States' colonies, meaning that one-eighth of the US population lived not in the States but in the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, American Samoa, or the US Virgin Islands. Yet major events in the country's colonial history, such as the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy or the Puerto Rican nationalist uprising of 1950 (which included an assassination attempt on Harry Truman), don't merit mention in These Truths . The Philippine War, which might have killed more US nationals than the American Civil War, appears briefly, but in Lepore's telling, it matters more for how it reflected and affected race relations in North America than for what it did to the Philippines. Lepore's national frame consistently directs her readers' gaze inward; it's the history of a \"we.\" She rightly has an inclusive understanding of that \"we,\" but she exhibits little interest in anything outside of it. The Vietnam War, which split the nation, consumes Lepore's attention. The Korean War, which didn't, she barely mentions, even though it permanently divided the Korean Peninsula and may have taken as many Asian lives as the Vietnam War did. Lepore writes ably and critically about the George W. Bush administration's Global War on Terrorism, yet she is more concerned with how the use of torture violated long-standing norms and tarnished national morals than she is with the far more consequential destabilization of the Middle East. Such far-off consequences of US actions are beyond Lepore's remit. In writing These Truths , she confined herself to \"what, in my view, a people constituted as a nation in the early twenty-first century need to know about their own past.\" That sounds sensible. But given that the nation in question is also an empire-with Native American reservations, overseas territories, and hundreds of military bases spread across the planet-perhaps its members should also know a little about the other peoples and pasts this empire has engrossed. They, too, are US history. T here's a reason Lepore doubles down on the nation-on the \"we\"-and it's not that she's ignorant of other approaches. While her colleagues are embarking on their free-form jazz odysseys, decentering the nation by writing books about oceans, most readers still see the world in terms of nations, and they want history written accordingly. \"They can get it from scholars or they can get it from demagogues, but get it they will,\" Lepore warns. She has a point. \"Serious historians,\" as Lepore calls them, are reluctant to deliver single-volume national histories or accounts of the powerful men and wars that shaped the country, but that hasn't stopped the less serious. \"America's bestselling historian,\" according to his publisher, is not a learned professor but former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. His wildly popular Killing series ( Killing Lincoln , Killing Kennedy , Killing Reagan , etc.), coauthored with Martin Dugard, offers national history in its familiar Father's Day form, just with more gore and less accuracy. Joining O'Reilly and Dugard atop the New York Times best-seller list are Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen, authors of the counter-Zinnian A Patriot's History of the United States . Schweikart can be found these days on Twitter, offering edifying thoughts about the \"DemoKKKrats.\" Driving the demagogues out of the Barnes & Noble will require more than just taking back the nation as an object of serious historical inquiry. Lepore also sees a need to show that object in a more flattering light. Whereas many of her colleagues narrate US history as a tragedy and a chronicle of oppression, Lepore sets out to capture a fuller range of feeling. Her version features \"a great deal of anguish,\" she admits, but it also contains \"decency and hope,\" \"prosperity and ambition,\" \"invention and beauty.\" Lepore's relatively upbeat tone is more than a sensibility; it's a politics. The Bill O'Reillys of the bookshelf, she insists in This America , have not only taken control of the national story but also claimed for themselves the mantle of patriotism. Lepore wants to take it back for liberals. O'Reilly and his ilk are, in her view, best described not as patriots but as nationalists using the flag as a cloak for their illiberal agendas. True patriots, those who cherish the liberal values of the country, must stand and be counted. Lepore's distinction-\"patriotism is animated by love, nationalism by hatred\"-is not one that holds up well under scrutiny, but her point is clear enough. She hopes that she can tell US history in an inclusive way, staring the cruelties of the past full in the face yet coming out of it with her faith in the country intact. This determination not to cede love of country to the nationalists supplies Lepore with a creed. \"The United States,\" she insists, \"is a nation founded on a deeply moral commitment to human dignity\" and to the proposition that \"all of us are equal.\" What's noteworthy here is not Lepore's celebration of dignity and equality; it's her insistence that such values lie at the core of the United States and always have. But that claim, essential to her patriotism, is hard to square with history. We now have a much better understanding of how central patriarchy, the Indian Wars, and slavery were to the country's founding, and Lepore denies none of this. (She writes that George Washington attended the Constitutional Convention wearing \"dentures made from ivory and from nine teeth pulled from the mouths of his slaves.\") Yet her faith is dauntless. \"Notwithstanding the agony and hypocrisy of the nation's past,\" she insists, \"these truths endure.\" T hese truths endure . Lepore's devotion to the country's core values is a major part of This America . She twice quotes historian Michael Kazin's point that radicals and reformers succeed in the United States only when they appeal to what he calls \"the national belief system.\" Lepore has little patience for those who fail to heed Kazin's advice, for the reformers and radicals who see that the national belief system as an impediment to equality rather than an instrument for achieving it. In These Truths , this comes out particularly clearly in Lepore's treatment of the Black Power movement, which she narrates through the figure of Stokely Carmichael. He began his career with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, as someone for whom political action meant registering voters. But by 1966 he had given up on reforms secured within the existing frame of US politics. \"The reality is that this nation, from top to bottom, is racist,\" he wrote in The New York Review of Books . \"We won't fight to save the present society.\" Lepore regards this position as reckless. She explains that his star wasn't the only one rising; this was also an era when a newly emboldened right emerged. When Carmichael received an invitation in 1966 to speak at the University of California, Berkeley, a California gubernatorial candidate named Ronald Reagan seized on it as a chance to bolster his own campaign. \"We cannot have the university campus used as a base from which to foment riots,\" Reagan declared. Predictably, Carmichael refused to back down, and in so doing, he \"played right into Reagan's hands,\" Lepore laments. The Republican candidate used Carmichael's speech as a wedge issue and won the election handily, triumphing in 55 out of California's 58 counties. It was, she writes with palpable irritation, \"a victory of conservatives over liberals.\" Lepore's pairing of Carmichael and Reagan is telling. Other historians charting the rise of the right have invoked such structural and economic factors as white flight to the suburbs and the rise of corporate-funded think tanks. Her narrative stresses what she views as the ill-advised intransigence of the left. \"With each new form of public protest, Reagan's political capital grew,\" she explains. As campus activists \"descended into disenchantment and a profound alienation from the idea of America itself,\" Republicans fed off that disenchantment. Conservatism surged, she writes, when liberalism faltered because \"the idea of identity replaced the idea of equality.\" We are now risking imminent collapse, Lepore insists. \"The nation has been coming apart.\" One horseman of the apocalypse is the right-wing radio host Alex Jones, who consumes so much of her attention that a reader unfamiliar with history might conclude from These Truths that his arrival in politics was more momentous than the Korean War. Certainly, Jones is a perfect villain for Lepore: Not only is he malicious, but he openly scorns any shared national project. But other illiberal horsemen stalk the land as well. Lepore sounds the alarm over \"left identity politics,\" particularly the campus-based \"alt-left\" (here she uses a Breitbart -favored pejorative), which she regards as comparable to the alt-right. She decries the left's \"meaningless outrage\" and \"sanctimonious accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.\" As an illustration, she describes a Twitter squabble. \"After fourteen people were killed in a terrorist attack on a gay nightclub in San Bernardino, California,\" she writes, \"the alt-left spent its energies in the aftermath of this tragedy attacking one another for breaches of the rules of 'intersectionality,' which involve intricate, identity-based hierarchies of suffering and virtue.\" Twitter users, she continues, responded to the news by angrily correcting newscasters who described the attack as the worst massacre in US history (that would be Wounded Knee, they insisted) and arguing about whether it was ableist to blame the shooting on mental illness. This is a caricature and an uncharacteristically mean one for Lepore, who typically treats her subjects with sympathy. Her account comes secondhand from Angela Nagle's Kill All Normies , and Lepore's garbling of it-conflating the attack on the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino with the mass shooting at Pulse in Orlando, Florida-strongly suggests that she hasn't read the offending tweets herself. I have. They seem far more calm and reasoned in context, and I saw no evidence that they consumed the \"energies\" of the left or set off cascading wokeness competitions. What is more, in reducing the younger left to these tweets, Lepore overlooks its bold environmental and economic agendas. At a time when progressive millennials are achieving extraordinary political success pushing programs like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, Lepore sees them as largely feckless, more likely to sink the ship than steer it. What young leftists fail to recognize, she continues, is how fragile the nation has become. In the decade before the Civil War, New York Senator William Seward warned of an \"irrepressible conflict\" brewing. Lepore quotes him when describing the sharpening of political knives that has been ongoing since the Reagan administration: The 2016 election \"nearly rent the nation in two,\" she writes. Holding it together will require repudiating extremism, affirming core values, and grabbing tight hold of the nation. \"Whether nations can remain liberal,\" she counsels, \"actually depends on the recovery of the many ways of understanding what it means to belong to a nation, and even to love a nation, the place, the people, and the idea itself.\" T he \"irrepressible conflict\" of which Seward warned killed hundreds of thousands, yet it also ended slavery. The war's two faces illustrate the big question at the center of Lepore's view of US history. For her, the United States has professed democratic equality from the start. There is no shortage of what she calls \"hypocrisy\"-the failure to live up to announced values-in its past. But progress has only ever been achieved by affirming the nation and those core values. That is the liberal view, and Lepore isn't alone in seeing things that way. Yet radicals tend to have a different understanding. In their view, the United States-a settler empire carved out of Native lands by rich white men, many of whom enslaved others-was not particularly egalitarian in its origins. If it's a better society today, this is because activists made seemingly unrealistic demands and fought for them. Stark conflict has been essential to progress, and the times of greatest national division-the 1860s, the 1960s and '70s-have also been times of major progressive victories like the abolition of slavery and the establishment of reproductive rights. For a radical, this is not the time to mend rifts or make compromises. It's a time of crisis-and when it comes to the threat of global warming, an existential one. It's also a rare chance to achieve root-and-branch change with regard to the environment, the economy, gender, sexuality, and race. If what is needed is an overhaul rather than an adjustment, then the ideals and methods of 18th century men-\"these truths\"-may not be the best guides. Lepore doesn't disavow radical aims, so her case for nation-centered histories and liberal patriotism is tactical. Global solidarities and widened horizons are fine to contemplate, but there's a reason that books about the nation sell best. To reject the nation is to give up on reaching an audience, on making a difference. Similarly, in her view, radical intentions are laudable, but radical political programs that condemn the nation backfire and inadvertently aid the enemy. In the end, she argues, it is liberals, not radicals, who can deliver progressive change. They do so using the most powerful tool within reach: the nation. The problem is that Lepore is preaching this liberal gospel in increasingly radical times. The Trump presidency and the climate crisis have raised sharp challenges to her worldview. She finds herself in the awkward position of espousing patriotism at a moment of cruel nationalism, of explaining why radicalism doesn't work at just the time radicals on all sides are gaining clout, and of insisting that the nation is the most relevant geographical unit while storms, droughts, and heat waves make a mockery of political borders. In the face of such challenges, Lepore stands firm: The nation and its founding values are a shared heritage, and we must hold fast to them.

After These Truths appeared, historian Christine DeLucia and other critics noticed that Lepore had made little room in her story for Native Americans, especially in the latter half. She acknowledged this and has added material to the paperback edition. Yet from reading This America , it's easy to see why indigenous peoples initially played a small role in her story. These Truths is the history of a nation, which Lepore defines as a \"political community\" that joins people \"as if they were a family.\" Native Americans, who have often defined themselves (and been defined in federal law) as nations apart from the United States, do not easily fit within her frame. They have been and continue to be an integral part of the country, but they haven't uniformly sought membership in the US nation, in what she calls the \"community of belonging and commitment.\" In This America , Lepore reckons with the presence of tribal nations within the United States. \"The struggle for native nationhood,\" she writes, helps to \"constitute the nation in much the same way that debates over the Constitution constitute the nation. They challenge the nation to live up to its ideals.\" This is fine as far as it goes, but notice what she has done in making such an assertion: To force indigenous demands for sovereignty into the frame of US national history, she's reinterpreted them as internal dissent, as part of a rich debate about how to achieve shared national goals. She's turned a country containing multiple nations into a single diverse nation. The problem is that seeing the \"struggle for native nationhood\" as a bid to help the US nation \"live up to its ideals\"-Lepore likens it to the civil rights movement-is to miss the point. Overseas territories are another blind spot, another part of the country that doesn't fit Lepore's nation-centered approach. By 1940, about 19 million people lived in the United States' colonies, meaning that one-eighth of the US population lived not in the States but in the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, American Samoa, or the US Virgin Islands. Yet major events in the country's colonial history, such as the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy or the Puerto Rican nationalist uprising of 1950 (which included an assassination attempt on Harry Truman), don't merit mention in These Truths . The Philippine War, which might have killed more US nationals than the American Civil War, appears briefly, but in Lepore's telling, it matters more for how it reflected and affected race relations in North America than for what it did to the Philippines. Lepore's national frame consistently directs her readers' gaze inward; it's the history of a \"we.\" She rightly has an inclusive understanding of that \"we,\" but she exhibits little interest in anything outside of it. The Vietnam War, which split the nation, consumes Lepore's attention. The Korean War, which didn't, she barely mentions, even though it permanently divided the Korean Peninsula and may have taken as many Asian lives as the Vietnam War did. Lepore writes ably and critically about the George W. Bush administration's Global War on Terrorism, yet she is more concerned with how the use of torture violated long-standing norms and tarnished national morals than she is with the far more consequential destabilization of the Middle East. Such far-off consequences of US actions are beyond Lepore's remit. In writing These Truths , she confined herself to \"what, in my view, a people constituted as a nation in the early twenty-first century need to know about their own past.\" That sounds sensible. But given that the nation in question is also an empire-with Native American reservations, overseas territories, and hundreds of military bases spread across the planet-perhaps its members should also know a little about the other peoples and pasts this empire has engrossed. They, too, are US history. T here's a reason Lepore doubles down on the nation-on the \"we\"-and it's not that she's ignorant of other approaches. While her colleagues are embarking on their free-form jazz odysseys, decentering the nation by writing books about oceans, most readers still see the world in terms of nations, and they want history written accordingly. \"They can get it from scholars or they can get it from demagogues, but get it they will,\" Lepore warns. She has a point. \"Serious historians,\" as Lepore calls them, are reluctant to deliver single-volume national histories or accounts of the powerful men and wars that shaped the country, but that hasn't stopped the less serious. \"America's bestselling historian,\" according to his publisher, is not a learned professor but former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. His wildly popular Killing series ( Killing Lincoln , Killing Kennedy , Killing Reagan , etc.), coauthored with Martin Dugard, offers national history in its familiar Father's Day form, just with more gore and less accuracy. Joining O'Reilly and Dugard atop the New York Times best-seller list are Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen, authors of the counter-Zinnian A Patriot's History of the United States . Schweikart can be found these days on Twitter, offering edifying thoughts about the \"DemoKKKrats.\" Driving the demagogues out of the Barnes & Noble will require more than just taking back the nation as an object of serious historical inquiry. Lepore also sees a need to show that object in a more flattering light. Whereas many of her colleagues narrate US history as a tragedy and a chronicle of oppression, Lepore sets out to capture a fuller range of feeling. Her version features \"a great deal of anguish,\" she admits, but it also contains \"decency and hope,\" \"prosperity and ambition,\" \"invention and beauty.\" Lepore's relatively upbeat tone is more than a sensibility; it's a politics. The Bill O'Reillys of the bookshelf, she insists in This America , have not only taken control of the national story but also claimed for themselves the mantle of patriotism. Lepore wants to take it back for liberals. O'Reilly and his ilk are, in her view, best described not as patriots but as nationalists using the flag as a cloak for their illiberal agendas. True patriots, those who cherish the liberal values of the country, must stand and be counted. Lepore's distinction-\"patriotism is animated by love, nationalism by hatred\"-is not one that holds up well under scrutiny, but her point is clear enough. She hopes that she can tell US history in an inclusive way, staring the cruelties of the past full in the face yet coming out of it with her faith in the country intact. This determination not to cede love of country to the nationalists supplies Lepore with a creed. \"The United States,\" she insists, \"is a nation founded on a deeply moral commitment to human dignity\" and to the proposition that \"all of us are equal.\" What's noteworthy here is not Lepore's celebration of dignity and equality; it's her insistence that such values lie at the core of the United States and always have. But that claim, essential to her patriotism, is hard to square with history. We now have a much better understanding of how central patriarchy, the Indian Wars, and slavery were to the country's founding, and Lepore denies none of this. (She writes that George Washington attended the Constitutional Convention wearing \"dentures made from ivory and from nine teeth pulled from the mouths of his slaves.\") Yet her faith is dauntless. \"Notwithstanding the agony and hypocrisy of the nation's past,\" she insists, \"these truths endure.\" T hese truths endure . Lepore's devotion to the country's core values is a major part of This America . She twice quotes historian Michael Kazin's point that radicals and reformers succeed in the United States only when they appeal to what he calls \"the national belief system.\" Lepore has little patience for those who fail to heed Kazin's advice, for the reformers and radicals who see that the national belief system as an impediment to equality rather than an instrument for achieving it. In These Truths , this comes out particularly clearly in Lepore's treatment of the Black Power movement, which she narrates through the figure of Stokely Carmichael. He began his career with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, as someone for whom political action meant registering voters. But by 1966 he had given up on reforms secured within the existing frame of US politics. \"The reality is that this nation, from top to bottom, is racist,\" he wrote in The New York Review of Books . \"We won't fight to save the present society.\" Lepore regards this position as reckless. She explains that his star wasn't the only one rising; this was also an era when a newly emboldened right emerged. When Carmichael received an invitation in 1966 to speak at the University of California, Berkeley, a California gubernatorial candidate named Ronald Reagan seized on it as a chance to bolster his own campaign. \"We cannot have the university campus used as a base from which to foment riots,\" Reagan declared. Predictably, Carmichael refused to back down, and in so doing, he \"played right into Reagan's hands,\" Lepore laments. The Republican candidate used Carmichael's speech as a wedge issue and won the election handily, triumphing in 55 out of California's 58 counties. It was, she writes with palpable irritation, \"a victory of conservatives over liberals.\" Lepore's pairing of Carmichael and Reagan is telling. Other historians charting the rise of the right have invoked such structural and economic factors as white flight to the suburbs and the rise of corporate-funded think tanks. Her narrative stresses what she views as the ill-advised intransigence of the left. \"With each new form of public protest, Reagan's political capital grew,\" she explains. As campus activists \"descended into disenchantment and a profound alienation from the idea of America itself,\" Republicans fed off that disenchantment. Conservatism surged, she writes, when liberalism faltered because \"the idea of identity replaced the idea of equality.\" We are now risking imminent collapse, Lepore insists. \"The nation has been coming apart.\" One horseman of the apocalypse is the right-wing radio host Alex Jones, who consumes so much of her attention that a reader unfamiliar with history might conclude from These Truths that his arrival in politics was more momentous than the Korean War. Certainly, Jones is a perfect villain for Lepore: Not only is he malicious, but he openly scorns any shared national project. But other illiberal horsemen stalk the land as well. Lepore sounds the alarm over \"left identity politics,\" particularly the campus-based \"alt-left\" (here she uses a Breitbart -favored pejorative), which she regards as comparable to the alt-right. She decries the left's \"meaningless outrage\" and \"sanctimonious accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.\" As an illustration, she describes a Twitter squabble. \"After fourteen people were killed in a terrorist attack on a gay nightclub in San Bernardino, California,\" she writes, \"the alt-left spent its energies in the aftermath of this tragedy attacking one another for breaches of the rules of 'intersectionality,' which involve intricate, identity-based hierarchies of suffering and virtue.\" Twitter users, she continues, responded to the news by angrily correcting newscasters who described the attack as the worst massacre in US history (that would be Wounded Knee, they insisted) and arguing about whether it was ableist to blame the shooting on mental illness. This is a caricature and an uncharacteristically mean one for Lepore, who typically treats her subjects with sympathy. Her account comes secondhand from Angela Nagle's Kill All Normies , and Lepore's garbling of it-conflating the attack on the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino with the mass shooting at Pulse in Orlando, Florida-strongly suggests that she hasn't read the offending tweets herself. I have. They seem far more calm and reasoned in context, and I saw no evidence that they consumed the \"energies\" of the left or set off cascading wokeness competitions. What is more, in reducing the younger left to these tweets, Lepore overlooks its bold environmental and economic agendas. At a time when progressive millennials are achieving extraordinary political success pushing programs like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, Lepore sees them as largely feckless, more likely to sink the ship than steer it. What young leftists fail to recognize, she continues, is how fragile the nation has become. In the decade before the Civil War, New York Senator William Seward warned of an \"irrepressible conflict\" brewing. Lepore quotes him when describing the sharpening of political knives that has been ongoing since the Reagan administration: The 2016 election \"nearly rent the nation in two,\" she writes. Holding it together will require repudiating extremism, affirming core values, and grabbing tight hold of the nation. \"Whether nations can remain liberal,\" she counsels, \"actually depends on the recovery of the many ways of understanding what it means to belong to a nation, and even to love a nation, the place, the people, and the idea itself.\" T he \"irrepressible conflict\" of which Seward warned killed hundreds of thousands, yet it also ended slavery. The war's two faces illustrate the big question at the center of Lepore's view of US history. For her, the United States has professed democratic equality from the start. There is no shortage of what she calls \"hypocrisy\"-the failure to live up to announced values-in its past. But progress has only ever been achieved by affirming the nation and those core values. That is the liberal view, and Lepore isn't alone in seeing things that way. Yet radicals tend to have a different understanding. In their view, the United States-a settler empire carved out of Native lands by rich white men, many of whom enslaved others-was not particularly egalitarian in its origins. If it's a better society today, this is because activists made seemingly unrealistic demands and fought for them. Stark conflict has been essential to progress, and the times of greatest national division-the 1860s, the 1960s and '70s-have also been times of major progressive victories like the abolition of slavery and the establishment of reproductive rights. For a radical, this is not the time to mend rifts or make compromises. It's a time of crisis-and when it comes to the threat of global warming, an existential one. It's also a rare chance to achieve root-and-branch change with regard to the environment, the economy, gender, sexuality, and race. If what is needed is an overhaul rather than an adjustment, then the ideals and methods of 18th century men-\"these truths\"-may not be the best guides. Lepore doesn't disavow radical aims, so her case for nation-centered histories and liberal patriotism is tactical. Global solidarities and widened horizons are fine to contemplate, but there's a reason that books about the nation sell best. To reject the nation is to give up on reaching an audience, on making a difference. Similarly, in her view, radical intentions are laudable, but radical political programs that condemn the nation backfire and inadvertently aid the enemy. In the end, she argues, it is liberals, not radicals, who can deliver progressive change. They do so using the most powerful tool within reach: the nation. The problem is that Lepore is preaching this liberal gospel in increasingly radical times. The Trump presidency and the climate crisis have raised sharp challenges to her worldview. She finds herself in the awkward position of espousing patriotism at a moment of cruel nationalism, of explaining why radicalism doesn't work at just the time radicals on all sides are gaining clout, and of insisting that the nation is the most relevant geographical unit while storms, droughts, and heat waves make a mockery of political borders. In the face of such challenges, Lepore stands firm: The nation and its founding values are a shared heritage, and we must hold fast to them. The epic history she has written from this position is an important one, further evidence (if any were needed) of her prodigious powers. Yet it's hard not to wonder, as the evidence mounts daily that the old rules no longer apply, if the ground that Lepore is digging her heels into isn't an ice shelf, melting beneath her feet.\n\nAt least this was the case until Jill Lepore set out to \"rekindle a lost tradition\" with her nearly 1,000-page tome These Truths: A History of the United States, published in 2018. A Harvard professor, she won the Bancroft Prize, one of the most prestigious awards in the field, for her first book, The Name of War . The last 10 winners whose ages I could determine won the Bancroft, on average, in their late 50s; Lepore won it at 33 and has been virtually unstoppable ever since. Her colleagues in Harvard's history department have written an average of three scholarly books apiece; she has written 11. She's also cofounded a journal, coauthored a novel, and served on the staff of The New Yorker , for which she has written more than 100 pieces on topics ranging from Frankenstein to management theory. What is most impressive is that, in this white heat of research and writing, her work has been, well, conspicuously and reliably good.

Her fans attest to weeping over These Truths , and I'll confess to feeling a prelachrymal lump in my throat more than once while reading it. The story of Thomas Jefferson and his enslaved consort Sally Hemings isn't news. Yet reading Lepore's rendition of it, in which the tragedy of slavery cries out with an almost unbearable poignancy, is like watching a virtuoso pianist set to work on the \"Moonlight\" Sonata. You've heard the piece a thousand times; you just never quite appreciated how rich it was. But what do these deftly narrated stories add up to? Lepore is coy about announcing a thesis. Her flavorless title, These Truths , does less to guide the reader than Zinn's pugnacious A People's History of the United States or Adams's intended, evocative The American Dream . She is fascinated by political discourse, questions of inclusion, and communication technologies, yet it is only with her follow-up book-a short volume bearing the (similarly bland) title This America -that we clearly see how they connect. In the new book, Lepore shows her hand, revealing the political commitments that impelled her to write These Truths and that shape her worldview and approach to history. Current Issue View our current issue This America announces its intentions on the very first page. It is, she writes, an argument for \"the enduring importance of the United States and of American civic ideals.\" Those words may sound tepid, but they are, for Lepore, a declaration of a multifront war. Against scholars who have become too enamored with far-reaching global histories of capitalism and empire or too tightly focused on subnational identity groups, Lepore sternly redirects attention to the nation, a single people united by common experience. Against the \"postmodernism\" that she says has \"suffused\" politics-a Fox News right crying \"fake news\" and a millennial left that, she claims, locates epistemic authority in personal identity-Lepore stands for the reasonableness of the center. She's for free speech, civil debate, democratic processes, and love of country. Like Zinn, Lepore has written a soup-to-nuts history of the country. But unlike Zinn, she doesn't regard it as an us-versus-them story. Instead, she likens the nation to a ship that is barely still afloat. As liberalism's enemies pull up the planking to light \"bonfires of rage,\" patriots must mend the listing vessel before it tilts into the \"doom-black sea.\" Her history is itself intended as an act of repair. In the face of the forces rending the United States, Lepore depicts it as a unitary society with a distinct and laudable set of civic ideals, one whose past can be intelligibly told as a single story.

Randall Kennedy Zadie Smith's Turn to Short Fiction Rumaan Alam Jonathan Safran Foer and the Limits of Liberal Climate Politics Kate Aronoff S ingle stories are unfashionable at present. Historians today are relentless pluralizers, far more inclined to write the histories of modernities than the history of modernity. They have good reason(s). The more the field grows-new research, new perspectives-the harder it becomes for writers to agree on a central narrative. Two tendencies in particular have turned US history into a forest of tangled branches. The first is diversification: As their ranks have grown more heterogeneous, historians have consciously sought to offer accounts that aren't narrated solely from the implicit vantage of well-off white men. The second is globalization: The acceleration of flows of ideas, people, and things across borders in recent decades has called into question what \"the United States\" even means and whether its history can be hived off and told apart from that of the rest of the world. With regard to history's diversification, Lepore is warmly receptive. Having written a biography of Jane Franklin, Benjamin Franklin's lesser-known sister, Lepore is practiced at opening up the past so that it is not just the story of presidents and generals. On this score, These Truths excels. The American Revolution, for Lepore, stars not only George Washington but also Harry Washington, who toiled in slavery on the founder's plantation. Harry Washington escaped twice, fought with the British in the Revolution (while \"wearing a white sash stitched with the motto 'Liberty to Slaves'\"), and sailed for Sierra Leone, where he led his own revolt against the colonial government. Similarly, Lepore's version of the civil rights movement features, alongside Martin Luther King Jr., Pauli Murray, the brilliant intellectual and tactician whose contributions were likely kept quiet because Murray, born with female genitalia, identified as male. One of the great achievements of These Truths , in fact, is how tightly it weaves the Harry Washingtons and Pauli Murrays into its tapestry. Lepore includes them not dutifully but eagerly and to great effect. And by taking both Harry Washington and George Washington seriously at the same time, she compellingly demonstrates that writing an inclusive history needn't require splitting the past into separate histories \"divided by race, sex, or class,\" as Lepore contends many of her colleagues do. Related Article Eric Hobsbawm's Many Lefts David Marcus The second change that has fractured national narratives-globalization-is a more complicated story. Living with porous borders has led historians to recognize that the past isn't served up neatly in national containers. Borders, they argue, have never been as fixed and straightforward as maps suggest-and events have a way of spilling over them anyway. It's for this reason that historians increasingly study empires, borderlands, diasporas, oceans, trade networks, climatic zones, and other transnational entities rather than countries, as they used to all do. This is where Lepore draws the line: \"This world is a world of nations,\" she insists. These Truths is thus a resolutely national history, concerned with what takes place inside US borders, not beyond them. Lepore recognizes diversity within those boundary lines-the nation contains many kinds and colors-but she nevertheless consistently interprets that diversity as part of a shared national heritage. There is something admirably inclusive about Lepore's vision of the country as a diverse nation, but there is something restricting about it, too.

Her account comes secondhand from Angela Nagle's Kill All Normies , and Lepore's garbling of it-conflating the attack on the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino with the mass shooting at Pulse in Orlando, Florida-strongly suggests that she hasn't read the offending tweets herself. I have. They seem far more calm and reasoned in context, and I saw no evidence that they consumed the \"energies\" of the left or set off cascading wokeness competitions. What is more, in reducing the younger left to these tweets, Lepore overlooks its bold environmental and economic agendas. At a time when progressive millennials are achieving extraordinary political success pushing programs like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, Lepore sees them as largely feckless, more likely to sink the ship than steer it. What young leftists fail to recognize, she continues, is how fragile the nation has become. In the decade before the Civil War, New York Senator William Seward warned of an \"irrepressible conflict\" brewing. Lepore quotes him when describing the sharpening of political knives that has been ongoing since the Reagan administration: The 2016 election \"nearly rent the nation in two,\" she writes. Holding it together will require repudiating extremism, affirming core values, and grabbing tight hold of the nation. \"Whether nations can remain liberal,\" she counsels, \"actually depends on the recovery of the many ways of understanding what it means to belong to a nation, and even to love a nation, the place, the people, and the idea itself.\" T he \"irrepressible conflict\" of which Seward warned killed hundreds of thousands, yet it also ended slavery. The war's two faces illustrate the big question at the center of Lepore's view of US history. For her, the United States has professed democratic equality from the start. There is no shortage of what she calls \"hypocrisy\"-the failure to live up to announced values-in its past. But progress has only ever been achieved by affirming the nation and those core values. That is the liberal view, and Lepore isn't alone in seeing things that way. Yet radicals tend to have a different understanding. In their view, the United States-a settler empire carved out of Native lands by rich white men, many of whom enslaved others-was not particularly egalitarian in its origins. If it's a better society today, this is because activists made seemingly unrealistic demands and fought for them. Stark conflict has been essential to progress, and the times of greatest national division-the 1860s, the 1960s and '70s-have also been times of major progressive victories like the abolition of slavery and the establishment of reproductive rights. For a radical, this is not the time to mend rifts or make compromises. It's a time of crisis-and when it comes to the threat of global warming, an existential one. It's also a rare chance to achieve root-and-branch change with regard to the environment, the economy, gender, sexuality, and race. If what is needed is an overhaul rather than an adjustment, then the ideals and methods of 18th century men-\"these truths\"-may not be the best guides. Lepore doesn't disavow radical aims, so her case for nation-centered histories and liberal patriotism is tactical. Global solidarities and widened horizons are fine to contemplate, but there's a reason that books about the nation sell best. To reject the nation is to give up on reaching an audience, on making a difference. Similarly, in her view, radical intentions are laudable, but radical political programs that condemn the nation backfire and inadvertently aid the enemy. In the end, she argues, it is liberals, not radicals, who can deliver progressive change. They do so using the most powerful tool within reach: the nation. The problem is that Lepore is preaching this liberal gospel in increasingly radical times. The Trump presidency and the climate crisis have raised sharp challenges to her worldview. She finds herself in the awkward position of espousing patriotism at a moment of cruel nationalism, of explaining why radicalism doesn't work at just the time radicals on all sides are gaining clout, and of insisting that the nation is the most relevant geographical unit while storms, droughts, and heat waves make a mockery of political borders. In the face of such challenges, Lepore stands firm: The nation and its founding values are a shared heritage, and we must hold fast to them. The epic history she has written from this position is an important one, further evidence (if any were needed) of her prodigious powers. Yet it's hard not to wonder, as the evidence mounts daily that the old rules no longer apply, if the ground that Lepore is digging her heels into isn't an ice shelf, melting beneath her feet.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nIt's been good, above all, because she is a superb storyteller. Her fans attest to weeping over These Truths , and I'll confess to feeling a prelachrymal lump in my throat more than once while reading it. The story of Thomas Jefferson and his enslaved consort Sally Hemings isn't news. Yet reading Lepore's rendition of it, in which the tragedy of slavery cries out with an almost unbearable poignancy, is like watching a virtuoso pianist set to work on the \"Moonlight\" Sonata. You've heard the piece a thousand times; you just never quite appreciated how rich it was. But what do these deftly narrated stories add up to? Lepore is coy about announcing a thesis. Her flavorless title, These Truths , does less to guide the reader than Zinn's pugnacious A People's History of the United States or Adams's intended, evocative The American Dream . She is fascinated by political discourse, questions of inclusion, and communication technologies, yet it is only with her follow-up book-a short volume bearing the (similarly bland) title This America -that we clearly see how they connect. In the new book, Lepore shows her hand, revealing the political commitments that impelled her to write These Truths and that shape her worldview and approach to history. Current Issue View our current issue This America announces its intentions on the very first page. It is, she writes, an argument for \"the enduring importance of the United States and of American civic ideals.\" Those words may sound tepid, but they are, for Lepore, a declaration of a multifront war. Against scholars who have become too enamored with far-reaching global histories of capitalism and empire or too tightly focused on subnational identity groups, Lepore sternly redirects attention to the nation, a single people united by common experience. Against the \"postmodernism\" that she says has \"suffused\" politics-a Fox News right crying \"fake news\" and a millennial left that, she claims, locates epistemic authority in personal identity-Lepore stands for the reasonableness of the center. She's for free speech, civil debate, democratic processes, and love of country. Like Zinn, Lepore has written a soup-to-nuts history of the country. But unlike Zinn, she doesn't regard it as an us-versus-them story. Instead, she likens the nation to a ship that is barely still afloat. As liberalism's enemies pull up the planking to light \"bonfires of rage,\" patriots must mend the listing vessel before it tilts into the \"doom-black sea.\" Her history is itself intended as an act of repair. In the face of the forces rending the United States, Lepore depicts it as a unitary society with a distinct and laudable set of civic ideals, one whose past can be intelligibly told as a single story.

Randall Kennedy Zadie Smith's Turn to Short Fiction Rumaan Alam Jonathan Safran Foer and the Limits of Liberal Climate Politics Kate Aronoff S ingle stories are unfashionable at present. Historians today are relentless pluralizers, far more inclined to write the histories of modernities than the history of modernity. They have good reason(s). The more the field grows-new research, new perspectives-the harder it becomes for writers to agree on a central narrative. Two tendencies in particular have turned US history into a forest of tangled branches. The first is diversification: As their ranks have grown more heterogeneous, historians have consciously sought to offer accounts that aren't narrated solely from the implicit vantage of well-off white men. The second is globalization: The acceleration of flows of ideas, people, and things across borders in recent decades has called into question what \"the United States\" even means and whether its history can be hived off and told apart from that of the rest of the world. With regard to history's diversification, Lepore is warmly receptive. Having written a biography of Jane Franklin, Benjamin Franklin's lesser-known sister, Lepore is practiced at opening up the past so that it is not just the story of presidents and generals. On this score, These Truths excels. The American Revolution, for Lepore, stars not only George Washington but also Harry Washington, who toiled in slavery on the founder's plantation. Harry Washington escaped twice, fought with the British in the Revolution (while \"wearing a white sash stitched with the motto 'Liberty to Slaves'\"), and sailed for Sierra Leone, where he led his own revolt against the colonial government. Similarly, Lepore's version of the civil rights movement features, alongside Martin Luther King Jr., Pauli Murray, the brilliant intellectual and tactician whose contributions were likely kept quiet because Murray, born with female genitalia, identified as male. One of the great achievements of These Truths , in fact, is how tightly it weaves the Harry Washingtons and Pauli Murrays into its tapestry. Lepore includes them not dutifully but eagerly and to great effect. And by taking both Harry Washington and George Washington seriously at the same time, she compellingly demonstrates that writing an inclusive history needn't require splitting the past into separate histories \"divided by race, sex, or class,\" as Lepore contends many of her colleagues do. Related Article Eric Hobsbawm's Many Lefts David Marcus The second change that has fractured national narratives-globalization-is a more complicated story. Living with porous borders has led historians to recognize that the past isn't served up neatly in national containers. Borders, they argue, have never been as fixed and straightforward as maps suggest-and events have a way of spilling over them anyway. It's for this reason that historians increasingly study empires, borderlands, diasporas, oceans, trade networks, climatic zones, and other transnational entities rather than countries, as they used to all do. This is where Lepore draws the line: \"This world is a world of nations,\" she insists. These Truths is thus a resolutely national history, concerned with what takes place inside US borders, not beyond them. Lepore recognizes diversity within those boundary lines-the nation contains many kinds and colors-but she nevertheless consistently interprets that diversity as part of a shared national heritage. There is something admirably inclusive about Lepore's vision of the country as a diverse nation, but there is something restricting about it, too. After These Truths appeared, historian Christine DeLucia and other critics noticed that Lepore had made little room in her story for Native Americans, especially in the latter half. She acknowledged this and has added material to the paperback edition. Yet from reading This America , it's easy to see why indigenous peoples initially played a small role in her story. These Truths is the history of a nation, which Lepore defines as a \"political community\" that joins people \"as if they were a family.\" Native Americans, who have often defined themselves (and been defined in federal law) as nations apart from the United States, do not easily fit within her frame. They have been and continue to be an integral part of the country, but they haven't uniformly sought membership in the US nation, in what she calls the \"community of belonging and commitment.\" In This America , Lepore reckons with the presence of tribal nations within the United States. \"The struggle for native nationhood,\" she writes, helps to \"constitute the nation in much the same way that debates over the Constitution constitute the nation. They challenge the nation to live up to its ideals.\" This is fine as far as it goes, but notice what she has done in making such an assertion: To force indigenous demands for sovereignty into the frame of US national history, she's reinterpreted them as internal dissent, as part of a rich debate about how to achieve shared national goals. She's turned a country containing multiple nations into a single diverse nation. The problem is that seeing the \"struggle for native nationhood\" as a bid to help the US nation \"live up to its ideals\"-Lepore likens it to the civil rights movement-is to miss the point. Overseas territories are another blind spot, another part of the country that doesn't fit Lepore's nation-centered approach. By 1940, about 19 million people lived in the United States' colonies, meaning that one-eighth of the US population lived not in the States but in the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, American Samoa, or the US Virgin Islands. Yet major events in the country's colonial history, such as the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy or the Puerto Rican nationalist uprising of 1950 (which included an assassination attempt on Harry Truman), don't merit mention in These Truths . The Philippine War, which might have killed more US nationals than the American Civil War, appears briefly, but in Lepore's telling, it matters more for how it reflected and affected race relations in North America than for what it did to the Philippines. Lepore's national frame consistently directs her readers' gaze inward; it's the history of a \"we.\" She rightly has an inclusive understanding of that \"we,\" but she exhibits little interest in anything outside of it. The Vietnam War, which split the nation, consumes Lepore's attention. The Korean War, which didn't, she barely mentions, even though it permanently divided the Korean Peninsula and may have taken as many Asian lives as the Vietnam War did. Lepore writes ably and critically about the George W. Bush administration's Global War on Terrorism, yet she is more concerned with how the use of torture violated long-standing norms and tarnished national morals than she is with the far more consequential destabilization of the Middle East. Such far-off consequences of US actions are beyond Lepore's remit. In writing These Truths , she confined herself to \"what, in my view, a people constituted as a nation in the early twenty-first century need to know about their own past.\" That sounds sensible. But given that the nation in question is also an empire-with Native American reservations, overseas territories, and hundreds of military bases spread across the planet-perhaps its members should also know a little about the other peoples and pasts this empire has engrossed. They, too, are US history. T here's a reason Lepore doubles down on the nation-on the \"we\"-and it's not that she's ignorant of other approaches. While her colleagues are embarking on their free-form jazz odysseys, decentering the nation by writing books about oceans, most readers still see the world in terms of nations, and they want history written accordingly. \"They can get it from scholars or they can get it from demagogues, but get it they will,\" Lepore warns. She has a point. \"Serious historians,\" as Lepore calls them, are reluctant to deliver single-volume national histories or accounts of the powerful men and wars that shaped the country, but that hasn't stopped the less serious. \"America's bestselling historian,\" according to his publisher, is not a learned professor but former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. His wildly popular Killing series ( Killing Lincoln , Killing Kennedy , Killing Reagan , etc.), coauthored with Martin Dugard, offers national history in its familiar Father's Day form, just with more gore and less accuracy. Joining O'Reilly and Dugard atop the New York Times best-seller list are Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen, authors of the counter-Zinnian A Patriot's History of the United States . Schweikart can be found these days on Twitter, offering edifying thoughts about the \"DemoKKKrats.\" Driving the demagogues out of the Barnes & Noble will require more than just taking back the nation as an object of serious historical inquiry. Lepore also sees a need to show that object in a more flattering light. Whereas many of her colleagues narrate US history as a tragedy and a chronicle of oppression, Lepore sets out to capture a fuller range of feeling. Her version features \"a great deal of anguish,\" she admits, but it also contains \"decency and hope,\" \"prosperity and ambition,\" \"invention and beauty.\" Lepore's relatively upbeat tone is more than a sensibility; it's a politics. The Bill O'Reillys of the bookshelf, she insists in This America , have not only taken control of the national story but also claimed for themselves the mantle of patriotism. Lepore wants to take it back for liberals. O'Reilly and his ilk are, in her view, best described not as patriots but as nationalists using the flag as a cloak for their illiberal agendas. True patriots, those who cherish the liberal values of the country, must stand and be counted. Lepore's distinction-\"patriotism is animated by love, nationalism by hatred\"-is not one that holds up well under scrutiny, but her point is clear enough. She hopes that she can tell US history in an inclusive way, staring the cruelties of the past full in the face yet coming out of it with her faith in the country intact. This determination not to cede love of country to the nationalists supplies Lepore with a creed. \"The United States,\" she insists, \"is a nation founded on a deeply moral commitment to human dignity\" and to the proposition that \"all of us are equal.\" What's noteworthy here is not Lepore's celebration of dignity and equality; it's her insistence that such values lie at the core of the United States and always have. But that claim, essential to her patriotism, is hard to square with history. We now have a much better understanding of how central patriarchy, the Indian Wars, and slavery were to the country's founding, and Lepore denies none of this. (She writes that George Washington attended the Constitutional Convention wearing \"dentures made from ivory and from nine teeth pulled from the mouths of his slaves.\") Yet her faith is dauntless. \"Notwithstanding the agony and hypocrisy of the nation's past,\" she insists, \"these truths endure.\" T hese truths endure . Lepore's devotion to the country's core values is a major part of This America . She twice quotes historian Michael Kazin's point that radicals and reformers succeed in the United States only when they appeal to what he calls \"the national belief system.\" Lepore has little patience for those who fail to heed Kazin's advice, for the reformers and radicals who see that the national belief system as an impediment to equality rather than an instrument for achieving it. In These Truths , this comes out particularly clearly in Lepore's treatment of the Black Power movement, which she narrates through the figure of Stokely Carmichael. He began his career with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, as someone for whom political action meant registering voters. But by 1966 he had given up on reforms secured within the existing frame of US politics. \"The reality is that this nation, from top to bottom, is racist,\" he wrote in The New York Review of Books . \"We won't fight to save the present society.\" Lepore regards this position as reckless. She explains that his star wasn't the only one rising; this was also an era when a newly emboldened right emerged. When Carmichael received an invitation in 1966 to speak at the University of California, Berkeley, a California gubernatorial candidate named Ronald Reagan seized on it as a chance to bolster his own campaign. \"We cannot have the university campus used as a base from which to foment riots,\" Reagan declared. Predictably, Carmichael refused to back down, and in so doing, he \"played right into Reagan's hands,\" Lepore laments. The Republican candidate used Carmichael's speech as a wedge issue and won the election handily, triumphing in 55 out of California's 58 counties. It was, she writes with palpable irritation, \"a victory of conservatives over liberals.\" Lepore's pairing of Carmichael and Reagan is telling. Other historians charting the rise of the right have invoked such structural and economic factors as white flight to the suburbs and the rise of corporate-funded think tanks. Her narrative stresses what she views as the ill-advised intransigence of the left. \"With each new form of public protest, Reagan's political capital grew,\" she explains. As campus activists \"descended into disenchantment and a profound alienation from the idea of America itself,\" Republicans fed off that disenchantment. Conservatism surged, she writes, when liberalism faltered because \"the idea of identity replaced the idea of equality.\" We are now risking imminent collapse, Lepore insists. \"The nation has been coming apart.\" One horseman of the apocalypse is the right-wing radio host Alex Jones, who consumes so much of her attention that a reader unfamiliar with history might conclude from These Truths that his arrival in politics was more momentous than the Korean War. Certainly, Jones is a perfect villain for Lepore: Not only is he malicious, but he openly scorns any shared national project. But other illiberal horsemen stalk the land as well. Lepore sounds the alarm over \"left identity politics,\" particularly the campus-based \"alt-left\" (here she uses a Breitbart -favored pejorative), which she regards as comparable to the alt-right. She decries the left's \"meaningless outrage\" and \"sanctimonious accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.\" As an illustration, she describes a Twitter squabble. \"After fourteen people were killed in a terrorist attack on a gay nightclub in San Bernardino, California,\" she writes, \"the alt-left spent its energies in the aftermath of this tragedy attacking one another for breaches of the rules of 'intersectionality,' which involve intricate, identity-based hierarchies of suffering and virtue.\" Twitter users, she continues, responded to the news by angrily correcting newscasters who described the attack as the worst massacre in US history (that would be Wounded Knee, they insisted) and arguing about whether it was ableist to blame the shooting on mental illness.

The Philippine War, which might have killed more US nationals than the American Civil War, appears briefly, but in Lepore's telling, it matters more for how it reflected and affected race relations in North America than for what it did to the Philippines. Lepore's national frame consistently directs her readers' gaze inward; it's the history of a \"we.\" She rightly has an inclusive understanding of that \"we,\" but she exhibits little interest in anything outside of it. The Vietnam War, which split the nation, consumes Lepore's attention. The Korean War, which didn't, she barely mentions, even though it permanently divided the Korean Peninsula and may have taken as many Asian lives as the Vietnam War did. Lepore writes ably and critically about the George W. Bush administration's Global War on Terrorism, yet she is more concerned with how the use of torture violated long-standing norms and tarnished national morals than she is with the far more consequential destabilization of the Middle East. Such far-off consequences of US actions are beyond Lepore's remit. In writing These Truths , she confined herself to \"what, in my view, a people constituted as a nation in the early twenty-first century need to know about their own past.\" That sounds sensible. But given that the nation in question is also an empire-with Native American reservations, overseas territories, and hundreds of military bases spread across the planet-perhaps its members should also know a little about the other peoples and pasts this empire has engrossed. They, too, are US history. T here's a reason Lepore doubles down on the nation-on the \"we\"-and it's not that she's ignorant of other approaches. While her colleagues are embarking on their free-form jazz odysseys, decentering the nation by writing books about oceans, most readers still see the world in terms of nations, and they want history written accordingly. \"They can get it from scholars or they can get it from demagogues, but get it they will,\" Lepore warns. She has a point. \"Serious historians,\" as Lepore calls them, are reluctant to deliver single-volume national histories or accounts of the powerful men and wars that shaped the country, but that hasn't stopped the less serious. \"America's bestselling historian,\" according to his publisher, is not a learned professor but former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. His wildly popular Killing series ( Killing Lincoln , Killing Kennedy , Killing Reagan , etc.), coauthored with Martin Dugard, offers national history in its familiar Father's Day form, just with more gore and less accuracy. Joining O'Reilly and Dugard atop the New York Times best-seller list are Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen, authors of the counter-Zinnian A Patriot's History of the United States . Schweikart can be found these days on Twitter, offering edifying thoughts about the \"DemoKKKrats.\" Driving the demagogues out of the Barnes & Noble will require more than just taking back the nation as an object of serious historical inquiry. Lepore also sees a need to show that object in a more flattering light. Whereas many of her colleagues narrate US history as a tragedy and a chronicle of oppression, Lepore sets out to capture a fuller range of feeling. Her version features \"a great deal of anguish,\" she admits, but it also contains \"decency and hope,\" \"prosperity and ambition,\" \"invention and beauty.\" Lepore's relatively upbeat tone is more than a sensibility; it's a politics. The Bill O'Reillys of the bookshelf, she insists in This America , have not only taken control of the national story but also claimed for themselves the mantle of patriotism. Lepore wants to take it back for liberals. O'Reilly and his ilk are, in her view, best described not as patriots but as nationalists using the flag as a cloak for their illiberal agendas. True patriots, those who cherish the liberal values of the country, must stand and be counted. Lepore's distinction-\"patriotism is animated by love, nationalism by hatred\"-is not one that holds up well under scrutiny, but her point is clear enough. She hopes that she can tell US history in an inclusive way, staring the cruelties of the past full in the face yet coming out of it with her faith in the country intact. This determination not to cede love of country to the nationalists supplies Lepore with a creed. \"The United States,\" she insists, \"is a nation founded on a deeply moral commitment to human dignity\" and to the proposition that \"all of us are equal.\" What's noteworthy here is not Lepore's celebration of dignity and equality; it's her insistence that such values lie at the core of the United States and always have. But that claim, essential to her patriotism, is hard to square with history. We now have a much better understanding of how central patriarchy, the Indian Wars, and slavery were to the country's founding, and Lepore denies none of this. (She writes that George Washington attended the Constitutional Convention wearing \"dentures made from ivory and from nine teeth pulled from the mouths of his slaves.\") Yet her faith is dauntless. \"Notwithstanding the agony and hypocrisy of the nation's past,\" she insists, \"these truths endure.\" T hese truths endure . Lepore's devotion to the country's core values is a major part of This America . She twice quotes historian Michael Kazin's point that radicals and reformers succeed in the United States only when they appeal to what he calls \"the national belief system.\" Lepore has little patience for those who fail to heed Kazin's advice, for the reformers and radicals who see that the national belief system as an impediment to equality rather than an instrument for achieving it. In These Truths , this comes out particularly clearly in Lepore's treatment of the Black Power movement, which she narrates through the figure of Stokely Carmichael. He began his career with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, as someone for whom political action meant registering voters. But by 1966 he had given up on reforms secured within the existing frame of US politics. \"The reality is that this nation, from top to bottom, is racist,\" he wrote in The New York Review of Books . \"We won't fight to save the present society.\" Lepore regards this position as reckless. She explains that his star wasn't the only one rising; this was also an era when a newly emboldened right emerged. When Carmichael received an invitation in 1966 to speak at the University of California, Berkeley, a California gubernatorial candidate named Ronald Reagan seized on it as a chance to bolster his own campaign. \"We cannot have the university campus used as a base from which to foment riots,\" Reagan declared. Predictably, Carmichael refused to back down, and in so doing, he \"played right into Reagan's hands,\" Lepore laments. The Republican candidate used Carmichael's speech as a wedge issue and won the election handily, triumphing in 55 out of California's 58 counties. It was, she writes with palpable irritation, \"a victory of conservatives over liberals.\" Lepore's pairing of Carmichael and Reagan is telling. Other historians charting the rise of the right have invoked such structural and economic factors as white flight to the suburbs and the rise of corporate-funded think tanks. Her narrative stresses what she views as the ill-advised intransigence of the left. \"With each new form of public protest, Reagan's political capital grew,\" she explains. As campus activists \"descended into disenchantment and a profound alienation from the idea of America itself,\" Republicans fed off that disenchantment. Conservatism surged, she writes, when liberalism faltered because \"the idea of identity replaced the idea of equality.\" We are now risking imminent collapse, Lepore insists. \"The nation has been coming apart.\" One horseman of the apocalypse is the right-wing radio host Alex Jones, who consumes so much of her attention that a reader unfamiliar with history might conclude from These Truths that his arrival in politics was more momentous than the Korean War. Certainly, Jones is a perfect villain for Lepore: Not only is he malicious, but he openly scorns any shared national project. But other illiberal horsemen stalk the land as well. Lepore sounds the alarm over \"left identity politics,\" particularly the campus-based \"alt-left\" (here she uses a Breitbart -favored pejorative), which she regards as comparable to the alt-right. She decries the left's \"meaningless outrage\" and \"sanctimonious accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.\" As an illustration, she describes a Twitter squabble. \"After fourteen people were killed in a terrorist attack on a gay nightclub in San Bernardino, California,\" she writes, \"the alt-left spent its energies in the aftermath of this tragedy attacking one another for breaches of the rules of 'intersectionality,' which involve intricate, identity-based hierarchies of suffering and virtue.\" Twitter users, she continues, responded to the news by angrily correcting newscasters who described the attack as the worst massacre in US history (that would be Wounded Knee, they insisted) and arguing about whether it was ableist to blame the shooting on mental illness. This is a caricature and an uncharacteristically mean one for Lepore, who typically treats her subjects with sympathy. Her account comes secondhand from Angela Nagle's Kill All Normies , and Lepore's garbling of it-conflating the attack on the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino with the mass shooting at Pulse in Orlando, Florida-strongly suggests that she hasn't read the offending tweets herself. I have. They seem far more calm and reasoned in context, and I saw no evidence that they consumed the \"energies\" of the left or set off cascading wokeness competitions. What is more, in reducing the younger left to these tweets, Lepore overlooks its bold environmental and economic agendas. At a time when progressive millennials are achieving extraordinary political success pushing programs like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, Lepore sees them as largely feckless, more likely to sink the ship than steer it. What young leftists fail to recognize, she continues, is how fragile the nation has become. In the decade before the Civil War, New York Senator William Seward warned of an \"irrepressible conflict\" brewing. Lepore quotes him when describing the sharpening of political knives that has been ongoing since the Reagan administration: The 2016 election \"nearly rent the nation in two,\" she writes. Holding it together will require repudiating extremism, affirming core values, and grabbing tight hold of the nation. \"Whether nations can remain liberal,\" she counsels, \"actually depends on the recovery of the many ways of understanding what it means to belong to a nation, and even to love a nation, the place, the people, and the idea itself.\" T he \"irrepressible conflict\" of which Seward warned killed hundreds of thousands, yet it also ended slavery. The war's two faces illustrate the big question at the center of Lepore's view of US history. For her, the United States has professed democratic equality from the start. There is no shortage of what she calls \"hypocrisy\"-the failure to live up to announced values-in its past. But progress has only ever been achieved by affirming the nation and those core values. That is the liberal view, and Lepore isn't alone in seeing things that way. Yet radicals tend to have a different understanding. In their view, the United States-a settler empire carved out of Native lands by rich white men, many of whom enslaved others-was not particularly egalitarian in its origins. If it's a better society today, this is because activists made seemingly unrealistic demands and fought for them. Stark conflict has been essential to progress, and the times of greatest national division-the 1860s, the 1960s and '70s-have also been times of major progressive victories like the abolition of slavery and the establishment of reproductive rights. For a radical, this is not the time to mend rifts or make compromises. It's a time of crisis-and when it comes to the threat of global warming, an existential one. It's also a rare chance to achieve root-and-branch change with regard to the environment, the economy, gender, sexuality, and race. If what is needed is an overhaul rather than an adjustment, then the ideals and methods of 18th century men-\"these truths\"-may not be the best guides. Lepore doesn't disavow radical aims, so her case for nation-centered histories and liberal patriotism is tactical. Global solidarities and widened horizons are fine to contemplate, but there's a reason that books about the nation sell best. To reject the nation is to give up on reaching an audience, on making a difference. Similarly, in her view, radical intentions are laudable, but radical political programs that condemn the nation backfire and inadvertently aid the enemy. In the end, she argues, it is liberals, not radicals, who can deliver progressive change. They do so using the most powerful tool within reach: the nation. The problem is that Lepore is preaching this liberal gospel in increasingly radical times. The Trump presidency and the climate crisis have raised sharp challenges to her worldview. She finds herself in the awkward position of espousing patriotism at a moment of cruel nationalism, of explaining why radicalism doesn't work at just the time radicals on all sides are gaining clout, and of insisting that the nation is the most relevant geographical unit while storms, droughts, and heat waves make a mockery of political borders. In the face of such challenges, Lepore stands firm: The nation and its founding values are a shared heritage, and we must hold fast to them. The epic history she has written from this position is an important one, further evidence (if any were needed) of her prodigious powers. Yet it's hard not to wonder, as the evidence mounts daily that the old rules no longer apply, if the ground that Lepore is digging her heels into isn't an ice shelf, melting beneath her feet.\n\nThis America announces its intentions on the very first page. It is, she writes, an argument for \"the enduring importance of the United States and of American civic ideals.\" Those words may sound tepid, but they are, for Lepore, a declaration of a multifront war. Against scholars who have become too enamored with far-reaching global histories of capitalism and empire or too tightly focused on subnational identity groups, Lepore sternly redirects attention to the nation, a single people united by common experience. Against the \"postmodernism\" that she says has \"suffused\" politics-a Fox News right crying \"fake news\" and a millennial left that, she claims, locates epistemic authority in personal identity-Lepore stands for the reasonableness of the center. She's for free speech, civil debate, democratic processes, and love of country. Like Zinn, Lepore has written a soup-to-nuts history of the country. But unlike Zinn, she doesn't regard it as an us-versus-them story. Instead, she likens the nation to a ship that is barely still afloat. As liberalism's enemies pull up the planking to light \"bonfires of rage,\" patriots must mend the listing vessel before it tilts into the \"doom-black sea.\" Her history is itself intended as an act of repair. In the face of the forces rending the United States, Lepore depicts it as a unitary society with a distinct and laudable set of civic ideals, one whose past can be intelligibly told as a single story.

Randall Kennedy Zadie Smith's Turn to Short Fiction Rumaan Alam Jonathan Safran Foer and the Limits of Liberal Climate Politics Kate Aronoff S ingle stories are unfashionable at present. Historians today are relentless pluralizers, far more inclined to write the histories of modernities than the history of modernity. They have good reason(s). The more the field grows-new research, new perspectives-the harder it becomes for writers to agree on a central narrative. Two tendencies in particular have turned US history into a forest of tangled branches. The first is diversification: As their ranks have grown more heterogeneous, historians have consciously sought to offer accounts that aren't narrated solely from the implicit vantage of well-off white men. The second is globalization: The acceleration of flows of ideas, people, and things across borders in recent decades has called into question what \"the United States\" even means and whether its history can be hived off and told apart from that of the rest of the world. With regard to history's diversification, Lepore is warmly receptive. Having written a biography of Jane Franklin, Benjamin Franklin's lesser-known sister, Lepore is practiced at opening up the past so that it is not just the story of presidents and generals. On this score, These Truths excels. The American Revolution, for Lepore, stars not only George Washington but also Harry Washington, who toiled in slavery on the founder's plantation. Harry Washington escaped twice, fought with the British in the Revolution (while \"wearing a white sash stitched with the motto 'Liberty to Slaves'\"), and sailed for Sierra Leone, where he led his own revolt against the colonial government. Similarly, Lepore's version of the civil rights movement features, alongside Martin Luther King Jr., Pauli Murray, the brilliant intellectual and tactician whose contributions were likely kept quiet because Murray, born with female genitalia, identified as male. One of the great achievements of These Truths , in fact, is how tightly it weaves the Harry Washingtons and Pauli Murrays into its tapestry. Lepore includes them not dutifully but eagerly and to great effect. And by taking both Harry Washington and George Washington seriously at the same time, she compellingly demonstrates that writing an inclusive history needn't require splitting the past into separate histories \"divided by race, sex, or class,\" as Lepore contends many of her colleagues do. Related Article Eric Hobsbawm's Many Lefts David Marcus The second change that has fractured national narratives-globalization-is a more complicated story. Living with porous borders has led historians to recognize that the past isn't served up neatly in national containers. Borders, they argue, have never been as fixed and straightforward as maps suggest-and events have a way of spilling over them anyway. It's for this reason that historians increasingly study empires, borderlands, diasporas, oceans, trade networks, climatic zones, and other transnational entities rather than countries, as they used to all do. This is where Lepore draws the line: \"This world is a world of nations,\" she insists. These Truths is thus a resolutely national history, concerned with what takes place inside US borders, not beyond them. Lepore recognizes diversity within those boundary lines-the nation contains many kinds and colors-but she nevertheless consistently interprets that diversity as part of a shared national heritage. There is something admirably inclusive about Lepore's vision of the country as a diverse nation, but there is something restricting about it, too. After These Truths appeared, historian Christine DeLucia and other critics noticed that Lepore had made little room in her story for Native Americans, especially in the latter half. She acknowledged this and has added material to the paperback edition. Yet from reading This America , it's easy to see why indigenous peoples initially played a small role in her story. These Truths is the history of a nation, which Lepore defines as a \"political community\" that joins people \"as if they were a family.\" Native Americans, who have often defined themselves (and been defined in federal law) as nations apart from the United States, do not easily fit within her frame. They have been and continue to be an integral part of the country, but they haven't uniformly sought membership in the US nation, in what she calls the \"community of belonging and commitment.\" In This America , Lepore reckons with the presence of tribal nations within the United States. \"The struggle for native nationhood,\" she writes, helps to \"constitute the nation in much the same way that debates over the Constitution constitute the nation. They challenge the nation to live up to its ideals.\" This is fine as far as it goes, but notice what she has done in making such an assertion: To force indigenous demands for sovereignty into the frame of US national history, she's reinterpreted them as internal dissent, as part of a rich debate about how to achieve shared national goals. She's turned a country containing multiple nations into a single diverse nation. The problem is that seeing the \"struggle for native nationhood\" as a bid to help the US nation \"live up to its ideals\"-Lepore likens it to the civil rights movement-is to miss the point. Overseas territories are another blind spot, another part of the country that doesn't fit Lepore's nation-centered approach. By 1940, about 19 million people lived in the United States' colonies, meaning that one-eighth of the US population lived not in the States but in the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, American Samoa, or the US Virgin Islands. Yet major events in the country's colonial history, such as the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy or the Puerto Rican nationalist uprising of 1950 (which included an assassination attempt on Harry Truman), don't merit mention in These Truths . The Philippine War, which might have killed more US nationals than the American Civil War, appears briefly, but in Lepore's telling, it matters more for how it reflected and affected race relations in North America than for what it did to the Philippines. Lepore's national frame consistently directs her readers' gaze inward; it's the history of a \"we.\" She rightly has an inclusive understanding of that \"we,\" but she exhibits little interest in anything outside of it. The Vietnam War, which split the nation, consumes Lepore's attention. The Korean War, which didn't, she barely mentions, even though it permanently divided the Korean Peninsula and may have taken as many Asian lives as the Vietnam War did.

Historians today are relentless pluralizers, far more inclined to write the histories of modernities than the history of modernity. They have good reason(s). The more the field grows-new research, new perspectives-the harder it becomes for writers to agree on a central narrative. Two tendencies in particular have turned US history into a forest of tangled branches. The first is diversification: As their ranks have grown more heterogeneous, historians have consciously sought to offer accounts that aren't narrated solely from the implicit vantage of well-off white men. The second is globalization: The acceleration of flows of ideas, people, and things across borders in recent decades has called into question what \"the United States\" even means and whether its history can be hived off and told apart from that of the rest of the world. With regard to history's diversification, Lepore is warmly receptive. Having written a biography of Jane Franklin, Benjamin Franklin's lesser-known sister, Lepore is practiced at opening up the past so that it is not just the story of presidents and generals. On this score, These Truths excels. The American Revolution, for Lepore, stars not only George Washington but also Harry Washington, who toiled in slavery on the founder's plantation. Harry Washington escaped twice, fought with the British in the Revolution (while \"wearing a white sash stitched with the motto 'Liberty to Slaves'\"), and sailed for Sierra Leone, where he led his own revolt against the colonial government. Similarly, Lepore's version of the civil rights movement features, alongside Martin Luther King Jr., Pauli Murray, the brilliant intellectual and tactician whose contributions were likely kept quiet because Murray, born with female genitalia, identified as male. One of the great achievements of These Truths , in fact, is how tightly it weaves the Harry Washingtons and Pauli Murrays into its tapestry. Lepore includes them not dutifully but eagerly and to great effect. And by taking both Harry Washington and George Washington seriously at the same time, she compellingly demonstrates that writing an inclusive history needn't require splitting the past into separate histories \"divided by race, sex, or class,\" as Lepore contends many of her colleagues do. Related Article Eric Hobsbawm's Many Lefts David Marcus The second change that has fractured national narratives-globalization-is a more complicated story. Living with porous borders has led historians to recognize that the past isn't served up neatly in national containers. Borders, they argue, have never been as fixed and straightforward as maps suggest-and events have a way of spilling over them anyway. It's for this reason that historians increasingly study empires, borderlands, diasporas, oceans, trade networks, climatic zones, and other transnational entities rather than countries, as they used to all do. This is where Lepore draws the line: \"This world is a world of nations,\" she insists. These Truths is thus a resolutely national history, concerned with what takes place inside US borders, not beyond them. Lepore recognizes diversity within those boundary lines-the nation contains many kinds and colors-but she nevertheless consistently interprets that diversity as part of a shared national heritage. There is something admirably inclusive about Lepore's vision of the country as a diverse nation, but there is something restricting about it, too. After These Truths appeared, historian Christine DeLucia and other critics noticed that Lepore had made little room in her story for Native Americans, especially in the latter half. She acknowledged this and has added material to the paperback edition. Yet from reading This America , it's easy to see why indigenous peoples initially played a small role in her story. These Truths is the history of a nation, which Lepore defines as a \"political community\" that joins people \"as if they were a family.\" Native Americans, who have often defined themselves (and been defined in federal law) as nations apart from the United States, do not easily fit within her frame. They have been and continue to be an integral part of the country, but they haven't uniformly sought membership in the US nation, in what she calls the \"community of belonging and commitment.\" In This America , Lepore reckons with the presence of tribal nations within the United States. \"The struggle for native nationhood,\" she writes, helps to \"constitute the nation in much the same way that debates over the Constitution constitute the nation. They challenge the nation to live up to its ideals.\" This is fine as far as it goes, but notice what she has done in making such an assertion: To force indigenous demands for sovereignty into the frame of US national history, she's reinterpreted them as internal dissent, as part of a rich debate about how to achieve shared national goals. She's turned a country containing multiple nations into a single diverse nation. The problem is that seeing the \"struggle for native nationhood\" as a bid to help the US nation \"live up to its ideals\"-Lepore likens it to the civil rights movement-is to miss the point. Overseas territories are another blind spot, another part of the country that doesn't fit Lepore's nation-centered approach. By 1940, about 19 million people lived in the United States' colonies, meaning that one-eighth of the US population lived not in the States but in the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, American Samoa, or the US Virgin Islands. Yet major events in the country's colonial history, such as the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy or the Puerto Rican nationalist uprising of 1950 (which included an assassination attempt on Harry Truman), don't merit mention in These Truths . The Philippine War, which might have killed more US nationals than the American Civil War, appears briefly, but in Lepore's telling, it matters more for how it reflected and affected race relations in North America than for what it did to the Philippines. Lepore's national frame consistently directs her readers' gaze inward; it's the history of a \"we.\" She rightly has an inclusive understanding of that \"we,\" but she exhibits little interest in anything outside of it. The Vietnam War, which split the nation, consumes Lepore's attention. The Korean War, which didn't, she barely mentions, even though it permanently divided the Korean Peninsula and may have taken as many Asian lives as the Vietnam War did. Lepore writes ably and critically about the George W. Bush administration's Global War on Terrorism, yet she is more concerned with how the use of torture violated long-standing norms and tarnished national morals than she is with the far more consequential destabilization of the Middle East. Such far-off consequences of US actions are beyond Lepore's remit. In writing These Truths , she confined herself to \"what, in my view, a people constituted as a nation in the early twenty-first century need to know about their own past.\" That sounds sensible. But given that the nation in question is also an empire-with Native American reservations, overseas territories, and hundreds of military bases spread across the planet-perhaps its members should also know a little about the other peoples and pasts this empire has engrossed. They, too, are US history. T here's a reason Lepore doubles down on the nation-on the \"we\"-and it's not that she's ignorant of other approaches. While her colleagues are embarking on their free-form jazz odysseys, decentering the nation by writing books about oceans, most readers still see the world in terms of nations, and they want history written accordingly. \"They can get it from scholars or they can get it from demagogues, but get it they will,\" Lepore warns. She has a point. \"Serious historians,\" as Lepore calls them, are reluctant to deliver single-volume national histories or accounts of the powerful men and wars that shaped the country, but that hasn't stopped the less serious. \"America's bestselling historian,\" according to his publisher, is not a learned professor but former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. His wildly popular Killing series ( Killing Lincoln , Killing Kennedy , Killing Reagan , etc.), coauthored with Martin Dugard, offers national history in its familiar Father's Day form, just with more gore and less accuracy. Joining O'Reilly and Dugard atop the New York Times best-seller list are Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen, authors of the counter-Zinnian A Patriot's History of the United States . Schweikart can be found these days on Twitter, offering edifying thoughts about the \"DemoKKKrats.\" Driving the demagogues out of the Barnes & Noble will require more than just taking back the nation as an object of serious historical inquiry. Lepore also sees a need to show that object in a more flattering light. Whereas many of her colleagues narrate US history as a tragedy and a chronicle of oppression, Lepore sets out to capture a fuller range of feeling. Her version features \"a great deal of anguish,\" she admits, but it also contains \"decency and hope,\" \"prosperity and ambition,\" \"invention and beauty.\" Lepore's relatively upbeat tone is more than a sensibility; it's a politics. The Bill O'Reillys of the bookshelf, she insists in This America , have not only taken control of the national story but also claimed for themselves the mantle of patriotism. Lepore wants to take it back for liberals. O'Reilly and his ilk are, in her view, best described not as patriots but as nationalists using the flag as a cloak for their illiberal agendas. True patriots, those who cherish the liberal values of the country, must stand and be counted. Lepore's distinction-\"patriotism is animated by love, nationalism by hatred\"-is not one that holds up well under scrutiny, but her point is clear enough. She hopes that she can tell US history in an inclusive way, staring the cruelties of the past full in the face yet coming out of it with her faith in the country intact. This determination not to cede love of country to the nationalists supplies Lepore with a creed. \"The United States,\" she insists, \"is a nation founded on a deeply moral commitment to human dignity\" and to the proposition that \"all of us are equal.\" What's noteworthy here is not Lepore's celebration of dignity and equality; it's her insistence that such values lie at the core of the United States and always have. But that claim, essential to her patriotism, is hard to square with history. We now have a much better understanding of how central patriarchy, the Indian Wars, and slavery were to the country's founding, and Lepore denies none of this. (She writes that George Washington attended the Constitutional Convention wearing \"dentures made from ivory and from nine teeth pulled from the mouths of his slaves.\") Yet her faith is dauntless. \"Notwithstanding the agony and hypocrisy of the nation's past,\" she insists, \"these truths endure.\" T hese truths endure . Lepore's devotion to the country's core values is a major part of This America . She twice quotes historian Michael Kazin's point that radicals and reformers succeed in the United States only when they appeal to what he calls \"the national belief system.\" Lepore has little patience for those who fail to heed Kazin's advice, for the reformers and radicals who see that the national belief system as an impediment to equality rather than an instrument for achieving it. In These Truths , this comes out particularly clearly in Lepore's treatment of the Black Power movement, which she narrates through the figure of Stokely Carmichael. He began his career with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, as someone for whom political action meant registering voters. But by 1966 he had given up on reforms secured within the existing frame of US politics. \"The reality is that this nation, from top to bottom, is racist,\" he wrote in The New York Review of Books . \"We won't fight to save the present society.\" Lepore regards this position as reckless. She explains that his star wasn't the only one rising; this was also an era when a newly emboldened right emerged. When Carmichael received an invitation in 1966 to speak at the University of California, Berkeley, a California gubernatorial candidate named Ronald Reagan seized on it as a chance to bolster his own campaign. \"We cannot have the university campus used as a base from which to foment riots,\" Reagan declared. Predictably, Carmichael refused to back down, and in so doing, he \"played right into Reagan's hands,\" Lepore laments. The Republican candidate used Carmichael's speech as a wedge issue and won the election handily, triumphing in 55 out of California's 58 counties. It was, she writes with palpable irritation, \"a victory of conservatives over liberals.\" Lepore's pairing of Carmichael and Reagan is telling. Other historians charting the rise of the right have invoked such structural and economic factors as white flight to the suburbs and the rise of corporate-funded think tanks. Her narrative stresses what she views as the ill-advised intransigence of the left. \"With each new form of public protest, Reagan's political capital grew,\" she explains. As campus activists \"descended into disenchantment and a profound alienation from the idea of America itself,\" Republicans fed off that disenchantment. Conservatism surged, she writes, when liberalism faltered because \"the idea of identity replaced the idea of equality.\" We are now risking imminent collapse, Lepore insists. \"The nation has been coming apart.\" One horseman of the apocalypse is the right-wing radio host Alex Jones, who consumes so much of her attention that a reader unfamiliar with history might conclude from These Truths that his arrival in politics was more momentous than the Korean War. Certainly, Jones is a perfect villain for Lepore: Not only is he malicious, but he openly scorns any shared national project. But other illiberal horsemen stalk the land as well. Lepore sounds the alarm over \"left identity politics,\" particularly the campus-based \"alt-left\" (here she uses a Breitbart -favored pejorative), which she regards as comparable to the alt-right. She decries the left's \"meaningless outrage\" and \"sanctimonious accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.\" As an illustration, she describes a Twitter squabble. \"After fourteen people were killed in a terrorist attack on a gay nightclub in San Bernardino, California,\" she writes, \"the alt-left spent its energies in the aftermath of this tragedy attacking one another for breaches of the rules of 'intersectionality,' which involve intricate, identity-based hierarchies of suffering and virtue.\" Twitter users, she continues, responded to the news by angrily correcting newscasters who described the attack as the worst massacre in US history (that would be Wounded Knee, they insisted) and arguing about whether it was ableist to blame the shooting on mental illness. This is a caricature and an uncharacteristically mean one for Lepore, who typically treats her subjects with sympathy. Her account comes secondhand from Angela Nagle's Kill All Normies , and Lepore's garbling of it-conflating the attack on the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino with the mass shooting at Pulse in Orlando, Florida-strongly suggests that she hasn't read the offending tweets herself. I have. They seem far more calm and reasoned in context, and I saw no evidence that they consumed the \"energies\" of the left or set off cascading wokeness competitions. What is more, in reducing the younger left to these tweets, Lepore overlooks its bold environmental and economic agendas. At a time when progressive millennials are achieving extraordinary political success pushing programs like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, Lepore sees them as largely feckless, more likely to sink the ship than steer it. What young leftists fail to recognize, she continues, is how fragile the nation has become. In the decade before the Civil War, New York Senator William Seward warned of an \"irrepressible conflict\" brewing. Lepore quotes him when describing the sharpening of political knives that has been ongoing since the Reagan administration: The 2016 election \"nearly rent the nation in two,\" she writes. Holding it together will require repudiating extremism, affirming core values, and grabbing tight hold of the nation. \"Whether nations can remain liberal,\" she counsels, \"actually depends on the recovery of the many ways of understanding what it means to belong to a nation, and even to love a nation, the place, the people, and the idea itself.\" T he \"irrepressible conflict\" of which Seward warned killed hundreds of thousands, yet it also ended slavery. The war's two faces illustrate the big question at the center of Lepore's view of US history. For her, the United States has professed democratic equality from the start. There is no shortage of what she calls \"hypocrisy\"-the failure to live up to announced values-in its past. But progress has only ever been achieved by affirming the nation and those core values. That is the liberal view, and Lepore isn't alone in seeing things that way. Yet radicals tend to have a different understanding. In their view, the United States-a settler empire carved out of Native lands by rich white men, many of whom enslaved others-was not particularly egalitarian in its origins. If it's a better society today, this is because activists made seemingly unrealistic demands and fought for them. Stark conflict has been essential to progress, and the times of greatest national division-the 1860s, the 1960s and '70s-have also been times of major progressive victories like the abolition of slavery and the establishment of reproductive rights. For a radical, this is not the time to mend rifts or make compromises. It's a time of crisis-and when it comes to the threat of global warming, an existential one. It's also a rare chance to achieve root-and-branch change with regard to the environment, the economy, gender, sexuality, and race. If what is needed is an overhaul rather than an adjustment, then the ideals and methods of 18th century men-\"these truths\"-may not be the best guides. Lepore doesn't disavow radical aims, so her case for nation-centered histories and liberal patriotism is tactical. Global solidarities and widened horizons are fine to contemplate, but there's a reason that books about the nation sell best. To reject the nation is to give up on reaching an audience, on making a difference. Similarly, in her view, radical intentions are laudable, but radical political programs that condemn the nation backfire and inadvertently aid the enemy. In the end, she argues, it is liberals, not radicals, who can deliver progressive change. They do so using the most powerful tool within reach: the nation. The problem is that Lepore is preaching this liberal gospel in increasingly radical times. The Trump presidency and the climate crisis have raised sharp challenges to her worldview. She finds herself in the awkward position of espousing patriotism at a moment of cruel nationalism, of explaining why radicalism doesn't work at just the time radicals on all sides are gaining clout, and of insisting that the nation is the most relevant geographical unit while storms, droughts, and heat waves make a mockery of political borders. In the face of such challenges, Lepore stands firm: The nation and its founding values are a shared heritage, and we must hold fast to them. The epic history she has written from this position is an important one, further evidence (if any were needed) of her prodigious powers. Yet it's hard not to wonder, as the evidence mounts daily that the old rules no longer apply, if the ground that Lepore is digging her heels into isn't an ice shelf, melting beneath her feet.\n\nElias Rodriques\n\nSeyla Benhabib\n\nAdom Getachew\n\nRandall Kennedy\n\nRumaan Alam\n\nKate Aronoff\n\nS ingle stories are unfashionable at present.

Holding it together will require repudiating extremism, affirming core values, and grabbing tight hold of the nation. \"Whether nations can remain liberal,\" she counsels, \"actually depends on the recovery of the many ways of understanding what it means to belong to a nation, and even to love a nation, the place, the people, and the idea itself.\" T he \"irrepressible conflict\" of which Seward warned killed hundreds of thousands, yet it also ended slavery. The war's two faces illustrate the big question at the center of Lepore's view of US history. For her, the United States has professed democratic equality from the start. There is no shortage of what she calls \"hypocrisy\"-the failure to live up to announced values-in its past. But progress has only ever been achieved by affirming the nation and those core values. That is the liberal view, and Lepore isn't alone in seeing things that way. Yet radicals tend to have a different understanding. In their view, the United States-a settler empire carved out of Native lands by rich white men, many of whom enslaved others-was not particularly egalitarian in its origins. If it's a better society today, this is because activists made seemingly unrealistic demands and fought for them. Stark conflict has been essential to progress, and the times of greatest national division-the 1860s, the 1960s and '70s-have also been times of major progressive victories like the abolition of slavery and the establishment of reproductive rights. For a radical, this is not the time to mend rifts or make compromises. It's a time of crisis-and when it comes to the threat of global warming, an existential one. It's also a rare chance to achieve root-and-branch change with regard to the environment, the economy, gender, sexuality, and race. If what is needed is an overhaul rather than an adjustment, then the ideals and methods of 18th century men-\"these truths\"-may not be the best guides. Lepore doesn't disavow radical aims, so her case for nation-centered histories and liberal patriotism is tactical. Global solidarities and widened horizons are fine to contemplate, but there's a reason that books about the nation sell best. To reject the nation is to give up on reaching an audience, on making a difference. Similarly, in her view, radical intentions are laudable, but radical political programs that condemn the nation backfire and inadvertently aid the enemy. In the end, she argues, it is liberals, not radicals, who can deliver progressive change. They do so using the most powerful tool within reach: the nation. The problem is that Lepore is preaching this liberal gospel in increasingly radical times. The Trump presidency and the climate crisis have raised sharp challenges to her worldview. She finds herself in the awkward position of espousing patriotism at a moment of cruel nationalism, of explaining why radicalism doesn't work at just the time radicals on all sides are gaining clout, and of insisting that the nation is the most relevant geographical unit while storms, droughts, and heat waves make a mockery of political borders. In the face of such challenges, Lepore stands firm: The nation and its founding values are a shared heritage, and we must hold fast to them. The epic history she has written from this position is an important one, further evidence (if any were needed) of her prodigious powers. Yet it's hard not to wonder, as the evidence mounts daily that the old rules no longer apply, if the ground that Lepore is digging her heels into isn't an ice shelf, melting beneath her feet.\n\nWith regard to history's diversification, Lepore is warmly receptive. Having written a biography of Jane Franklin, Benjamin Franklin's lesser-known sister, Lepore is practiced at opening up the past so that it is not just the story of presidents and generals. On this score, These Truths excels. The American Revolution, for Lepore, stars not only George Washington but also Harry Washington, who toiled in slavery on the founder's plantation. Harry Washington escaped twice, fought with the British in the Revolution (while \"wearing a white sash stitched with the motto 'Liberty to Slaves'\"), and sailed for Sierra Leone, where he led his own revolt against the colonial government. Similarly, Lepore's version of the civil rights movement features, alongside Martin Luther King Jr., Pauli Murray, the brilliant intellectual and tactician whose contributions were likely kept quiet because Murray, born with female genitalia, identified as male. One of the great achievements of These Truths , in fact, is how tightly it weaves the Harry Washingtons and Pauli Murrays into its tapestry. Lepore includes them not dutifully but eagerly and to great effect. And by taking both Harry Washington and George Washington seriously at the same time, she compellingly demonstrates that writing an inclusive history needn't require splitting the past into separate histories \"divided by race, sex, or class,\" as Lepore contends many of her colleagues do. Related Article Eric Hobsbawm's Many Lefts David Marcus The second change that has fractured national narratives-globalization-is a more complicated story. Living with porous borders has led historians to recognize that the past isn't served up neatly in national containers. Borders, they argue, have never been as fixed and straightforward as maps suggest-and events have a way of spilling over them anyway. It's for this reason that historians increasingly study empires, borderlands, diasporas, oceans, trade networks, climatic zones, and other transnational entities rather than countries, as they used to all do. This is where Lepore draws the line: \"This world is a world of nations,\" she insists. These Truths is thus a resolutely national history, concerned with what takes place inside US borders, not beyond them. Lepore recognizes diversity within those boundary lines-the nation contains many kinds and colors-but she nevertheless consistently interprets that diversity as part of a shared national heritage. There is something admirably inclusive about Lepore's vision of the country as a diverse nation, but there is something restricting about it, too. After These Truths appeared, historian Christine DeLucia and other critics noticed that Lepore had made little room in her story for Native Americans, especially in the latter half. She acknowledged this and has added material to the paperback edition. Yet from reading This America , it's easy to see why indigenous peoples initially played a small role in her story. These Truths is the history of a nation, which Lepore defines as a \"political community\" that joins people \"as if they were a family.\" Native Americans, who have often defined themselves (and been defined in federal law) as nations apart from the United States, do not easily fit within her frame. They have been and continue to be an integral part of the country, but they haven't uniformly sought membership in the US nation, in what she calls the \"community of belonging and commitment.\" In This America , Lepore reckons with the presence of tribal nations within the United States. \"The struggle for native nationhood,\" she writes, helps to \"constitute the nation in much the same way that debates over the Constitution constitute the nation. They challenge the nation to live up to its ideals.\" This is fine as far as it goes, but notice what she has done in making such an assertion: To force indigenous demands for sovereignty into the frame of US national history, she's reinterpreted them as internal dissent, as part of a rich debate about how to achieve shared national goals. She's turned a country containing multiple nations into a single diverse nation. The problem is that seeing the \"struggle for native nationhood\" as a bid to help the US nation \"live up to its ideals\"-Lepore likens it to the civil rights movement-is to miss the point. Overseas territories are another blind spot, another part of the country that doesn't fit Lepore's nation-centered approach. By 1940, about 19 million people lived in the United States' colonies, meaning that one-eighth of the US population lived not in the States but in the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, American Samoa, or the US Virgin Islands. Yet major events in the country's colonial history, such as the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy or the Puerto Rican nationalist uprising of 1950 (which included an assassination attempt on Harry Truman), don't merit mention in These Truths . The Philippine War, which might have killed more US nationals than the American Civil War, appears briefly, but in Lepore's telling, it matters more for how it reflected and affected race relations in North America than for what it did to the Philippines. Lepore's national frame consistently directs her readers' gaze inward; it's the history of a \"we.\" She rightly has an inclusive understanding of that \"we,\" but she exhibits little interest in anything outside of it. The Vietnam War, which split the nation, consumes Lepore's attention. The Korean War, which didn't, she barely mentions, even though it permanently divided the Korean Peninsula and may have taken as many Asian lives as the Vietnam War did. Lepore writes ably and critically about the George W. Bush administration's Global War on Terrorism, yet she is more concerned with how the use of torture violated long-standing norms and tarnished national morals than she is with the far more consequential destabilization of the Middle East. Such far-off consequences of US actions are beyond Lepore's remit. In writing These Truths , she confined herself to \"what, in my view, a people constituted as a nation in the early twenty-first century need to know about their own past.\" That sounds sensible. But given that the nation in question is also an empire-with Native American reservations, overseas territories, and hundreds of military bases spread across the planet-perhaps its members should also know a little about the other peoples and pasts this empire has engrossed. They, too, are US history. T here's a reason Lepore doubles down on the nation-on the \"we\"-and it's not that she's ignorant of other approaches. While her colleagues are embarking on their free-form jazz odysseys, decentering the nation by writing books about oceans, most readers still see the world in terms of nations, and they want history written accordingly. \"They can get it from scholars or they can get it from demagogues, but get it they will,\" Lepore warns. She has a point. \"Serious historians,\" as Lepore calls them, are reluctant to deliver single-volume national histories or accounts of the powerful men and wars that shaped the country, but that hasn't stopped the less serious. \"America's bestselling historian,\" according to his publisher, is not a learned professor but former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. His wildly popular Killing series ( Killing Lincoln , Killing Kennedy , Killing Reagan , etc.), coauthored with Martin Dugard, offers national history in its familiar Father's Day form, just with more gore and less accuracy. Joining O'Reilly and Dugard atop the New York Times best-seller list are Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen, authors of the counter-Zinnian A Patriot's History of the United States . Schweikart can be found these days on Twitter, offering edifying thoughts about the \"DemoKKKrats.\" Driving the demagogues out of the Barnes & Noble will require more than just taking back the nation as an object of serious historical inquiry. Lepore also sees a need to show that object in a more flattering light. Whereas many of her colleagues narrate US history as a tragedy and a chronicle of oppression, Lepore sets out to capture a fuller range of feeling. Her version features \"a great deal of anguish,\" she admits, but it also contains \"decency and hope,\" \"prosperity and ambition,\" \"invention and beauty.\" Lepore's relatively upbeat tone is more than a sensibility; it's a politics. The Bill O'Reillys of the bookshelf, she insists in This America , have not only taken control of the national story but also claimed for themselves the mantle of patriotism. Lepore wants to take it back for liberals. O'Reilly and his ilk are, in her view, best described not as patriots but as nationalists using the flag as a cloak for their illiberal agendas. True patriots, those who cherish the liberal values of the country, must stand and be counted. Lepore's distinction-\"patriotism is animated by love, nationalism by hatred\"-is not one that holds up well under scrutiny, but her point is clear enough. She hopes that she can tell US history in an inclusive way, staring the cruelties of the past full in the face yet coming out of it with her faith in the country intact. This determination not to cede love of country to the nationalists supplies Lepore with a creed. \"The United States,\" she insists, \"is a nation founded on a deeply moral commitment to human dignity\" and to the proposition that \"all of us are equal.\" What's noteworthy here is not Lepore's celebration of dignity and equality; it's her insistence that such values lie at the core of the United States and always have. But that claim, essential to her patriotism, is hard to square with history. We now have a much better understanding of how central patriarchy, the Indian Wars, and slavery were to the country's founding, and Lepore denies none of this. (She writes that George Washington attended the Constitutional Convention wearing \"dentures made from ivory and from nine teeth pulled from the mouths of his slaves.\") Yet her faith is dauntless. \"Notwithstanding the agony and hypocrisy of the nation's past,\" she insists, \"these truths endure.\" T hese truths endure . Lepore's devotion to the country's core values is a major part of This America . She twice quotes historian Michael Kazin's point that radicals and reformers succeed in the United States only when they appeal to what he calls \"the national belief system.\" Lepore has little patience for those who fail to heed Kazin's advice, for the reformers and radicals who see that the national belief system as an impediment to equality rather than an instrument for achieving it. In These Truths , this comes out particularly clearly in Lepore's treatment of the Black Power movement, which she narrates through the figure of Stokely Carmichael. He began his career with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, as someone for whom political action meant registering voters. But by 1966 he had given up on reforms secured within the existing frame of US politics. \"The reality is that this nation, from top to bottom, is racist,\" he wrote in The New York Review of Books . \"We won't fight to save the present society.\" Lepore regards this position as reckless. She explains that his star wasn't the only one rising; this was also an era when a newly emboldened right emerged. When Carmichael received an invitation in 1966 to speak at the University of California, Berkeley, a California gubernatorial candidate named Ronald Reagan seized on it as a chance to bolster his own campaign. \"We cannot have the university campus used as a base from which to foment riots,\" Reagan declared. Predictably, Carmichael refused to back down, and in so doing, he \"played right into Reagan's hands,\" Lepore laments. The Republican candidate used Carmichael's speech as a wedge issue and won the election handily, triumphing in 55 out of California's 58 counties. It was, she writes with palpable irritation, \"a victory of conservatives over liberals.\" Lepore's pairing of Carmichael and Reagan is telling. Other historians charting the rise of the right have invoked such structural and economic factors as white flight to the suburbs and the rise of corporate-funded think tanks. Her narrative stresses what she views as the ill-advised intransigence of the left. \"With each new form of public protest, Reagan's political capital grew,\" she explains. As campus activists \"descended into disenchantment and a profound alienation from the idea of America itself,\" Republicans fed off that disenchantment. Conservatism surged, she writes, when liberalism faltered because \"the idea of identity replaced the idea of equality.\" We are now risking imminent collapse, Lepore insists. \"The nation has been coming apart.\" One horseman of the apocalypse is the right-wing radio host Alex Jones, who consumes so much of her attention that a reader unfamiliar with history might conclude from These Truths that his arrival in politics was more momentous than the Korean War. Certainly, Jones is a perfect villain for Lepore: Not only is he malicious, but he openly scorns any shared national project. But other illiberal horsemen stalk the land as well. Lepore sounds the alarm over \"left identity politics,\" particularly the campus-based \"alt-left\" (here she uses a Breitbart -favored pejorative), which she regards as comparable to the alt-right. She decries the left's \"meaningless outrage\" and \"sanctimonious accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.\" As an illustration, she describes a Twitter squabble. \"After fourteen people were killed in a terrorist attack on a gay nightclub in San Bernardino, California,\" she writes, \"the alt-left spent its energies in the aftermath of this tragedy attacking one another for breaches of the rules of 'intersectionality,' which involve intricate, identity-based hierarchies of suffering and virtue.\" Twitter users, she continues, responded to the news by angrily correcting newscasters who described the attack as the worst massacre in US history (that would be Wounded Knee, they insisted) and arguing about whether it was ableist to blame the shooting on mental illness. This is a caricature and an uncharacteristically mean one for Lepore, who typically treats her subjects with sympathy. Her account comes secondhand from Angela Nagle's Kill All Normies , and Lepore's garbling of it-conflating the attack on the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino with the mass shooting at Pulse in Orlando, Florida-strongly suggests that she hasn't read the offending tweets herself. I have. They seem far more calm and reasoned in context, and I saw no evidence that they consumed the \"energies\" of the left or set off cascading wokeness competitions. What is more, in reducing the younger left to these tweets, Lepore overlooks its bold environmental and economic agendas. At a time when progressive millennials are achieving extraordinary political success pushing programs like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, Lepore sees them as largely feckless, more likely to sink the ship than steer it. What young leftists fail to recognize, she continues, is how fragile the nation has become. In the decade before the Civil War, New York Senator William Seward warned of an \"irrepressible conflict\" brewing. Lepore quotes him when describing the sharpening of political knives that has been ongoing since the Reagan administration: The 2016 election \"nearly rent the nation in two,\" she writes. Holding it together will require repudiating extremism, affirming core values, and grabbing tight hold of the nation. \"Whether nations can remain liberal,\" she counsels, \"actually depends on the recovery of the many ways of understanding what it means to belong to a nation, and even to love a nation, the place, the people, and the idea itself.\" T he \"irrepressible conflict\" of which Seward warned killed hundreds of thousands, yet it also ended slavery.

Lepore quotes him when describing the sharpening of political knives that has been ongoing since the Reagan administration: The 2016 election \"nearly rent the nation in two,\" she writes. Holding it together will require repudiating extremism, affirming core values, and grabbing tight hold of the nation. \"Whether nations can remain liberal,\" she counsels, \"actually depends on the recovery of the many ways of understanding what it means to belong to a nation, and even to love a nation, the place, the people, and the idea itself.\" T he \"irrepressible conflict\" of which Seward warned killed hundreds of thousands, yet it also ended slavery. The war's two faces illustrate the big question at the center of Lepore's view of US history. For her, the United States has professed democratic equality from the start. There is no shortage of what she calls \"hypocrisy\"-the failure to live up to announced values-in its past. But progress has only ever been achieved by affirming the nation and those core values. That is the liberal view, and Lepore isn't alone in seeing things that way. Yet radicals tend to have a different understanding. In their view, the United States-a settler empire carved out of Native lands by rich white men, many of whom enslaved others-was not particularly egalitarian in its origins. If it's a better society today, this is because activists made seemingly unrealistic demands and fought for them. Stark conflict has been essential to progress, and the times of greatest national division-the 1860s, the 1960s and '70s-have also been times of major progressive victories like the abolition of slavery and the establishment of reproductive rights. For a radical, this is not the time to mend rifts or make compromises. It's a time of crisis-and when it comes to the threat of global warming, an existential one. It's also a rare chance to achieve root-and-branch change with regard to the environment, the economy, gender, sexuality, and race. If what is needed is an overhaul rather than an adjustment, then the ideals and methods of 18th century men-\"these truths\"-may not be the best guides. Lepore doesn't disavow radical aims, so her case for nation-centered histories and liberal patriotism is tactical. Global solidarities and widened horizons are fine to contemplate, but there's a reason that books about the nation sell best. To reject the nation is to give up on reaching an audience, on making a difference. Similarly, in her view, radical intentions are laudable, but radical political programs that condemn the nation backfire and inadvertently aid the enemy. In the end, she argues, it is liberals, not radicals, who can deliver progressive change. They do so using the most powerful tool within reach: the nation. The problem is that Lepore is preaching this liberal gospel in increasingly radical times. The Trump presidency and the climate crisis have raised sharp challenges to her worldview. She finds herself in the awkward position of espousing patriotism at a moment of cruel nationalism, of explaining why radicalism doesn't work at just the time radicals on all sides are gaining clout, and of insisting that the nation is the most relevant geographical unit while storms, droughts, and heat waves make a mockery of political borders. In the face of such challenges, Lepore stands firm: The nation and its founding values are a shared heritage, and we must hold fast to them. The epic history she has written from this position is an important one, further evidence (if any were needed) of her prodigious powers. Yet it's hard not to wonder, as the evidence mounts daily that the old rules no longer apply, if the ground that Lepore is digging her heels into isn't an ice shelf, melting beneath her feet.\n\nDavid Marcus\n\nThe second change that has fractured national narratives-globalization-is a more complicated story. Living with porous borders has led historians to recognize that the past isn't served up neatly in national containers. Borders, they argue, have never been as fixed and straightforward as maps suggest-and events have a way of spilling over them anyway. It's for this reason that historians increasingly study empires, borderlands, diasporas, oceans, trade networks, climatic zones, and other transnational entities rather than countries, as they used to all do. This is where Lepore draws the line: \"This world is a world of nations,\" she insists. These Truths is thus a resolutely national history, concerned with what takes place inside US borders, not beyond them. Lepore recognizes diversity within those boundary lines-the nation contains many kinds and colors-but she nevertheless consistently interprets that diversity as part of a shared national heritage. There is something admirably inclusive about Lepore's vision of the country as a diverse nation, but there is something restricting about it, too. After These Truths appeared, historian Christine DeLucia and other critics noticed that Lepore had made little room in her story for Native Americans, especially in the latter half. She acknowledged this and has added material to the paperback edition. Yet from reading This America , it's easy to see why indigenous peoples initially played a small role in her story. These Truths is the history of a nation, which Lepore defines as a \"political community\" that joins people \"as if they were a family.\" Native Americans, who have often defined themselves (and been defined in federal law) as nations apart from the United States, do not easily fit within her frame. They have been and continue to be an integral part of the country, but they haven't uniformly sought membership in the US nation, in what she calls the \"community of belonging and commitment.\" In This America , Lepore reckons with the presence of tribal nations within the United States. \"The struggle for native nationhood,\" she writes, helps to \"constitute the nation in much the same way that debates over the Constitution constitute the nation. They challenge the nation to live up to its ideals.\" This is fine as far as it goes, but notice what she has done in making such an assertion: To force indigenous demands for sovereignty into the frame of US national history, she's reinterpreted them as internal dissent, as part of a rich debate about how to achieve shared national goals. She's turned a country containing multiple nations into a single diverse nation. The problem is that seeing the \"struggle for native nationhood\" as a bid to help the US nation \"live up to its ideals\"-Lepore likens it to the civil rights movement-is to miss the point. Overseas territories are another blind spot, another part of the country that doesn't fit Lepore's nation-centered approach. By 1940, about 19 million people lived in the United States' colonies, meaning that one-eighth of the US population lived not in the States but in the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, American Samoa, or the US Virgin Islands. Yet major events in the country's colonial history, such as the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy or the Puerto Rican nationalist uprising of 1950 (which included an assassination attempt on Harry Truman), don't merit mention in These Truths . The Philippine War, which might have killed more US nationals than the American Civil War, appears briefly, but in Lepore's telling, it matters more for how it reflected and affected race relations in North America than for what it did to the Philippines. Lepore's national frame consistently directs her readers' gaze inward; it's the history of a \"we.\" She rightly has an inclusive understanding of that \"we,\" but she exhibits little interest in anything outside of it. The Vietnam War, which split the nation, consumes Lepore's attention. The Korean War, which didn't, she barely mentions, even though it permanently divided the Korean Peninsula and may have taken as many Asian lives as the Vietnam War did. Lepore writes ably and critically about the George W. Bush administration's Global War on Terrorism, yet she is more concerned with how the use of torture violated long-standing norms and tarnished national morals than she is with the far more consequential destabilization of the Middle East. Such far-off consequences of US actions are beyond Lepore's remit. In writing These Truths , she confined herself to \"what, in my view, a people constituted as a nation in the early twenty-first century need to know about their own past.\" That sounds sensible. But given that the nation in question is also an empire-with Native American reservations, overseas territories, and hundreds of military bases spread across the planet-perhaps its members should also know a little about the other peoples and pasts this empire has engrossed. They, too, are US history. T here's a reason Lepore doubles down on the nation-on the \"we\"-and it's not that she's ignorant of other approaches. While her colleagues are embarking on their free-form jazz odysseys, decentering the nation by writing books about oceans, most readers still see the world in terms of nations, and they want history written accordingly. \"They can get it from scholars or they can get it from demagogues, but get it they will,\" Lepore warns. She has a point. \"Serious historians,\" as Lepore calls them, are reluctant to deliver single-volume national histories or accounts of the powerful men and wars that shaped the country, but that hasn't stopped the less serious. \"America's bestselling historian,\" according to his publisher, is not a learned professor but former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. His wildly popular Killing series ( Killing Lincoln , Killing Kennedy , Killing Reagan , etc.), coauthored with Martin Dugard, offers national history in its familiar Father's Day form, just with more gore and less accuracy. Joining O'Reilly and Dugard atop the New York Times best-seller list are Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen, authors of the counter-Zinnian A Patriot's History of the United States . Schweikart can be found these days on Twitter, offering edifying thoughts about the \"DemoKKKrats.\" Driving the demagogues out of the Barnes & Noble will require more than just taking back the nation as an object of serious historical inquiry. Lepore also sees a need to show that object in a more flattering light. Whereas many of her colleagues narrate US history as a tragedy and a chronicle of oppression, Lepore sets out to capture a fuller range of feeling. Her version features \"a great deal of anguish,\" she admits, but it also contains \"decency and hope,\" \"prosperity and ambition,\" \"invention and beauty.\" Lepore's relatively upbeat tone is more than a sensibility; it's a politics. The Bill O'Reillys of the bookshelf, she insists in This America , have not only taken control of the national story but also claimed for themselves the mantle of patriotism. Lepore wants to take it back for liberals. O'Reilly and his ilk are, in her view, best described not as patriots but as nationalists using the flag as a cloak for their illiberal agendas. True patriots, those who cherish the liberal values of the country, must stand and be counted. Lepore's distinction-\"patriotism is animated by love, nationalism by hatred\"-is not one that holds up well under scrutiny, but her point is clear enough. She hopes that she can tell US history in an inclusive way, staring the cruelties of the past full in the face yet coming out of it with her faith in the country intact. This determination not to cede love of country to the nationalists supplies Lepore with a creed. \"The United States,\" she insists, \"is a nation founded on a deeply moral commitment to human dignity\" and to the proposition that \"all of us are equal.\" What's noteworthy here is not Lepore's celebration of dignity and equality; it's her insistence that such values lie at the core of the United States and always have. But that claim, essential to her patriotism, is hard to square with history. We now have a much better understanding of how central patriarchy, the Indian Wars, and slavery were to the country's founding, and Lepore denies none of this. (She writes that George Washington attended the Constitutional Convention wearing \"dentures made from ivory and from nine teeth pulled from the mouths of his slaves.\") Yet her faith is dauntless. \"Notwithstanding the agony and hypocrisy of the nation's past,\" she insists, \"these truths endure.\" T hese truths endure . Lepore's devotion to the country's core values is a major part of This America . She twice quotes historian Michael Kazin's point that radicals and reformers succeed in the United States only when they appeal to what he calls \"the national belief system.\" Lepore has little patience for those who fail to heed Kazin's advice, for the reformers and radicals who see that the national belief system as an impediment to equality rather than an instrument for achieving it. In These Truths , this comes out particularly clearly in Lepore's treatment of the Black Power movement, which she narrates through the figure of Stokely Carmichael. He began his career with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, as someone for whom political action meant registering voters. But by 1966 he had given up on reforms secured within the existing frame of US politics. \"The reality is that this nation, from top to bottom, is racist,\" he wrote in The New York Review of Books . \"We won't fight to save the present society.\" Lepore regards this position as reckless. She explains that his star wasn't the only one rising; this was also an era when a newly emboldened right emerged. When Carmichael received an invitation in 1966 to speak at the University of California, Berkeley, a California gubernatorial candidate named Ronald Reagan seized on it as a chance to bolster his own campaign. \"We cannot have the university campus used as a base from which to foment riots,\" Reagan declared. Predictably, Carmichael refused to back down, and in so doing, he \"played right into Reagan's hands,\" Lepore laments. The Republican candidate used Carmichael's speech as a wedge issue and won the election handily, triumphing in 55 out of California's 58 counties. It was, she writes with palpable irritation, \"a victory of conservatives over liberals.\" Lepore's pairing of Carmichael and Reagan is telling. Other historians charting the rise of the right have invoked such structural and economic factors as white flight to the suburbs and the rise of corporate-funded think tanks. Her narrative stresses what she views as the ill-advised intransigence of the left. \"With each new form of public protest, Reagan's political capital grew,\" she explains. As campus activists \"descended into disenchantment and a profound alienation from the idea of America itself,\" Republicans fed off that disenchantment. Conservatism surged, she writes, when liberalism faltered because \"the idea of identity replaced the idea of equality.\" We are now risking imminent collapse, Lepore insists. \"The nation has been coming apart.\" One horseman of the apocalypse is the right-wing radio host Alex Jones, who consumes so much of her attention that a reader unfamiliar with history might conclude from These Truths that his arrival in politics was more momentous than the Korean War. Certainly, Jones is a perfect villain for Lepore: Not only is he malicious, but he openly scorns any shared national project. But other illiberal horsemen stalk the land as well. Lepore sounds the alarm over \"left identity politics,\" particularly the campus-based \"alt-left\" (here she uses a Breitbart -favored pejorative), which she regards as comparable to the alt-right. She decries the left's \"meaningless outrage\" and \"sanctimonious accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.\" As an illustration, she describes a Twitter squabble. \"After fourteen people were killed in a terrorist attack on a gay nightclub in San Bernardino, California,\" she writes, \"the alt-left spent its energies in the aftermath of this tragedy attacking one another for breaches of the rules of 'intersectionality,' which involve intricate, identity-based hierarchies of suffering and virtue.\" Twitter users, she continues, responded to the news by angrily correcting newscasters who described the attack as the worst massacre in US history (that would be Wounded Knee, they insisted) and arguing about whether it was ableist to blame the shooting on mental illness. This is a caricature and an uncharacteristically mean one for Lepore, who typically treats her subjects with sympathy. Her account comes secondhand from Angela Nagle's Kill All Normies , and Lepore's garbling of it-conflating the attack on the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino with the mass shooting at Pulse in Orlando, Florida-strongly suggests that she hasn't read the offending tweets herself. I have. They seem far more calm and reasoned in context, and I saw no evidence that they consumed the \"energies\" of the left or set off cascading wokeness competitions. What is more, in reducing the younger left to these tweets, Lepore overlooks its bold environmental and economic agendas. At a time when progressive millennials are achieving extraordinary political success pushing programs like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, Lepore sees them as largely feckless, more likely to sink the ship than steer it. What young leftists fail to recognize, she continues, is how fragile the nation has become. In the decade before the Civil War, New York Senator William Seward warned of an \"irrepressible conflict\" brewing. Lepore quotes him when describing the sharpening of political knives that has been ongoing since the Reagan administration: The 2016 election \"nearly rent the nation in two,\" she writes.

To reject the nation is to give up on reaching an audience, on making a difference. Similarly, in her view, radical intentions are laudable, but radical political programs that condemn the nation backfire and inadvertently aid the enemy. In the end, she argues, it is liberals, not radicals, who can deliver progressive change. They do so using the most powerful tool within reach: the nation. The problem is that Lepore is preaching this liberal gospel in increasingly radical times. The Trump presidency and the climate crisis have raised sharp challenges to her worldview. She finds herself in the awkward position of espousing patriotism at a moment of cruel nationalism, of explaining why radicalism doesn't work at just the time radicals on all sides are gaining clout, and of insisting that the nation is the most relevant geographical unit while storms, droughts, and heat waves make a mockery of political borders. In the face of such challenges, Lepore stands firm: The nation and its founding values are a shared heritage, and we must hold fast to them. The epic history she has written from this position is an important one, further evidence (if any were needed) of her prodigious powers. Yet it's hard not to wonder, as the evidence mounts daily that the old rules no longer apply, if the ground that Lepore is digging her heels into isn't an ice shelf, melting beneath her feet.\n\nThere is something admirably inclusive about Lepore's vision of the country as a diverse nation, but there is something restricting about it, too. After These Truths appeared, historian Christine DeLucia and other critics noticed that Lepore had made little room in her story for Native Americans, especially in the latter half. She acknowledged this and has added material to the paperback edition. Yet from reading This America , it's easy to see why indigenous peoples initially played a small role in her story. These Truths is the history of a nation, which Lepore defines as a \"political community\" that joins people \"as if they were a family.\" Native Americans, who have often defined themselves (and been defined in federal law) as nations apart from the United States, do not easily fit within her frame. They have been and continue to be an integral part of the country, but they haven't uniformly sought membership in the US nation, in what she calls the \"community of belonging and commitment.\" In This America , Lepore reckons with the presence of tribal nations within the United States. \"The struggle for native nationhood,\" she writes, helps to \"constitute the nation in much the same way that debates over the Constitution constitute the nation. They challenge the nation to live up to its ideals.\" This is fine as far as it goes, but notice what she has done in making such an assertion: To force indigenous demands for sovereignty into the frame of US national history, she's reinterpreted them as internal dissent, as part of a rich debate about how to achieve shared national goals. She's turned a country containing multiple nations into a single diverse nation. The problem is that seeing the \"struggle for native nationhood\" as a bid to help the US nation \"live up to its ideals\"-Lepore likens it to the civil rights movement-is to miss the point. Overseas territories are another blind spot, another part of the country that doesn't fit Lepore's nation-centered approach. By 1940, about 19 million people lived in the United States' colonies, meaning that one-eighth of the US population lived not in the States but in the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, American Samoa, or the US Virgin Islands. Yet major events in the country's colonial history, such as the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy or the Puerto Rican nationalist uprising of 1950 (which included an assassination attempt on Harry Truman), don't merit mention in These Truths . The Philippine War, which might have killed more US nationals than the American Civil War, appears briefly, but in Lepore's telling, it matters more for how it reflected and affected race relations in North America than for what it did to the Philippines. Lepore's national frame consistently directs her readers' gaze inward; it's the history of a \"we.\" She rightly has an inclusive understanding of that \"we,\" but she exhibits little interest in anything outside of it. The Vietnam War, which split the nation, consumes Lepore's attention. The Korean War, which didn't, she barely mentions, even though it permanently divided the Korean Peninsula and may have taken as many Asian lives as the Vietnam War did. Lepore writes ably and critically about the George W. Bush administration's Global War on Terrorism, yet she is more concerned with how the use of torture violated long-standing norms and tarnished national morals than she is with the far more consequential destabilization of the Middle East. Such far-off consequences of US actions are beyond Lepore's remit. In writing These Truths , she confined herself to \"what, in my view, a people constituted as a nation in the early twenty-first century need to know about their own past.\" That sounds sensible. But given that the nation in question is also an empire-with Native American reservations, overseas territories, and hundreds of military bases spread across the planet-perhaps its members should also know a little about the other peoples and pasts this empire has engrossed. They, too, are US history. T here's a reason Lepore doubles down on the nation-on the \"we\"-and it's not that she's ignorant of other approaches. While her colleagues are embarking on their free-form jazz odysseys, decentering the nation by writing books about oceans, most readers still see the world in terms of nations, and they want history written accordingly. \"They can get it from scholars or they can get it from demagogues, but get it they will,\" Lepore warns. She has a point. \"Serious historians,\" as Lepore calls them, are reluctant to deliver single-volume national histories or accounts of the powerful men and wars that shaped the country, but that hasn't stopped the less serious. \"America's bestselling historian,\" according to his publisher, is not a learned professor but former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. His wildly popular Killing series ( Killing Lincoln , Killing Kennedy , Killing Reagan , etc.), coauthored with Martin Dugard, offers national history in its familiar Father's Day form, just with more gore and less accuracy. Joining O'Reilly and Dugard atop the New York Times best-seller list are Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen, authors of the counter-Zinnian A Patriot's History of the United States . Schweikart can be found these days on Twitter, offering edifying thoughts about the \"DemoKKKrats.\" Driving the demagogues out of the Barnes & Noble will require more than just taking back the nation as an object of serious historical inquiry. Lepore also sees a need to show that object in a more flattering light. Whereas many of her colleagues narrate US history as a tragedy and a chronicle of oppression, Lepore sets out to capture a fuller range of feeling. Her version features \"a great deal of anguish,\" she admits, but it also contains \"decency and hope,\" \"prosperity and ambition,\" \"invention and beauty.\" Lepore's relatively upbeat tone is more than a sensibility; it's a politics. The Bill O'Reillys of the bookshelf, she insists in This America , have not only taken control of the national story but also claimed for themselves the mantle of patriotism. Lepore wants to take it back for liberals. O'Reilly and his ilk are, in her view, best described not as patriots but as nationalists using the flag as a cloak for their illiberal agendas. True patriots, those who cherish the liberal values of the country, must stand and be counted. Lepore's distinction-\"patriotism is animated by love, nationalism by hatred\"-is not one that holds up well under scrutiny, but her point is clear enough. She hopes that she can tell US history in an inclusive way, staring the cruelties of the past full in the face yet coming out of it with her faith in the country intact. This determination not to cede love of country to the nationalists supplies Lepore with a creed. \"The United States,\" she insists, \"is a nation founded on a deeply moral commitment to human dignity\" and to the proposition that \"all of us are equal.\" What's noteworthy here is not Lepore's celebration of dignity and equality; it's her insistence that such values lie at the core of the United States and always have. But that claim, essential to her patriotism, is hard to square with history. We now have a much better understanding of how central patriarchy, the Indian Wars, and slavery were to the country's founding, and Lepore denies none of this. (She writes that George Washington attended the Constitutional Convention wearing \"dentures made from ivory and from nine teeth pulled from the mouths of his slaves.\") Yet her faith is dauntless. \"Notwithstanding the agony and hypocrisy of the nation's past,\" she insists, \"these truths endure.\" T hese truths endure . Lepore's devotion to the country's core values is a major part of This America . She twice quotes historian Michael Kazin's point that radicals and reformers succeed in the United States only when they appeal to what he calls \"the national belief system.\" Lepore has little patience for those who fail to heed Kazin's advice, for the reformers and radicals who see that the national belief system as an impediment to equality rather than an instrument for achieving it. In These Truths , this comes out particularly clearly in Lepore's treatment of the Black Power movement, which she narrates through the figure of Stokely Carmichael. He began his career with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, as someone for whom political action meant registering voters. But by 1966 he had given up on reforms secured within the existing frame of US politics. \"The reality is that this nation, from top to bottom, is racist,\" he wrote in The New York Review of Books . \"We won't fight to save the present society.\" Lepore regards this position as reckless. She explains that his star wasn't the only one rising; this was also an era when a newly emboldened right emerged. When Carmichael received an invitation in 1966 to speak at the University of California, Berkeley, a California gubernatorial candidate named Ronald Reagan seized on it as a chance to bolster his own campaign. \"We cannot have the university campus used as a base from which to foment riots,\" Reagan declared. Predictably, Carmichael refused to back down, and in so doing, he \"played right into Reagan's hands,\" Lepore laments. The Republican candidate used Carmichael's speech as a wedge issue and won the election handily, triumphing in 55 out of California's 58 counties. It was, she writes with palpable irritation, \"a victory of conservatives over liberals.\" Lepore's pairing of Carmichael and Reagan is telling. Other historians charting the rise of the right have invoked such structural and economic factors as white flight to the suburbs and the rise of corporate-funded think tanks. Her narrative stresses what she views as the ill-advised intransigence of the left. \"With each new form of public protest, Reagan's political capital grew,\" she explains. As campus activists \"descended into disenchantment and a profound alienation from the idea of America itself,\" Republicans fed off that disenchantment. Conservatism surged, she writes, when liberalism faltered because \"the idea of identity replaced the idea of equality.\" We are now risking imminent collapse, Lepore insists. \"The nation has been coming apart.\" One horseman of the apocalypse is the right-wing radio host Alex Jones, who consumes so much of her attention that a reader unfamiliar with history might conclude from These Truths that his arrival in politics was more momentous than the Korean War. Certainly, Jones is a perfect villain for Lepore: Not only is he malicious, but he openly scorns any shared national project. But other illiberal horsemen stalk the land as well. Lepore sounds the alarm over \"left identity politics,\" particularly the campus-based \"alt-left\" (here she uses a Breitbart -favored pejorative), which she regards as comparable to the alt-right. She decries the left's \"meaningless outrage\" and \"sanctimonious accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.\" As an illustration, she describes a Twitter squabble. \"After fourteen people were killed in a terrorist attack on a gay nightclub in San Bernardino, California,\" she writes, \"the alt-left spent its energies in the aftermath of this tragedy attacking one another for breaches of the rules of 'intersectionality,' which involve intricate, identity-based hierarchies of suffering and virtue.\" Twitter users, she continues, responded to the news by angrily correcting newscasters who described the attack as the worst massacre in US history (that would be Wounded Knee, they insisted) and arguing about whether it was ableist to blame the shooting on mental illness. This is a caricature and an uncharacteristically mean one for Lepore, who typically treats her subjects with sympathy. Her account comes secondhand from Angela Nagle's Kill All Normies , and Lepore's garbling of it-conflating the attack on the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino with the mass shooting at Pulse in Orlando, Florida-strongly suggests that she hasn't read the offending tweets herself. I have. They seem far more calm and reasoned in context, and I saw no evidence that they consumed the \"energies\" of the left or set off cascading wokeness competitions. What is more, in reducing the younger left to these tweets, Lepore overlooks its bold environmental and economic agendas. At a time when progressive millennials are achieving extraordinary political success pushing programs like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, Lepore sees them as largely feckless, more likely to sink the ship than steer it. What young leftists fail to recognize, she continues, is how fragile the nation has become. In the decade before the Civil War, New York Senator William Seward warned of an \"irrepressible conflict\" brewing. Lepore quotes him when describing the sharpening of political knives that has been ongoing since the Reagan administration: The 2016 election \"nearly rent the nation in two,\" she writes. Holding it together will require repudiating extremism, affirming core values, and grabbing tight hold of the nation. \"Whether nations can remain liberal,\" she counsels, \"actually depends on the recovery of the many ways of understanding what it means to belong to a nation, and even to love a nation, the place, the people, and the idea itself.\" T he \"irrepressible conflict\" of which Seward warned killed hundreds of thousands, yet it also ended slavery. The war's two faces illustrate the big question at the center of Lepore's view of US history. For her, the United States has professed democratic equality from the start. There is no shortage of what she calls \"hypocrisy\"-the failure to live up to announced values-in its past. But progress has only ever been achieved by affirming the nation and those core values. That is the liberal view, and Lepore isn't alone in seeing things that way. Yet radicals tend to have a different understanding. In their view, the United States-a settler empire carved out of Native lands by rich white men, many of whom enslaved others-was not particularly egalitarian in its origins. If it's a better society today, this is because activists made seemingly unrealistic demands and fought for them. Stark conflict has been essential to progress, and the times of greatest national division-the 1860s, the 1960s and '70s-have also been times of major progressive victories like the abolition of slavery and the establishment of reproductive rights. For a radical, this is not the time to mend rifts or make compromises. It's a time of crisis-and when it comes to the threat of global warming, an existential one. It's also a rare chance to achieve root-and-branch change with regard to the environment, the economy, gender, sexuality, and race. If what is needed is an overhaul rather than an adjustment, then the ideals and methods of 18th century men-\"these truths\"-may not be the best guides. Lepore doesn't disavow radical aims, so her case for nation-centered histories and liberal patriotism is tactical. Global solidarities and widened horizons are fine to contemplate, but there's a reason that books about the nation sell best. To reject the nation is to give up on reaching an audience, on making a difference. Similarly, in her view, radical intentions are laudable, but radical political programs that condemn the nation backfire and inadvertently aid the enemy.

Joining O'Reilly and Dugard atop the New York Times best-seller list are Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen, authors of the counter-Zinnian A Patriot's History of the United States . Schweikart can be found these days on Twitter, offering edifying thoughts about the \"DemoKKKrats.\" Driving the demagogues out of the Barnes & Noble will require more than just taking back the nation as an object of serious historical inquiry. Lepore also sees a need to show that object in a more flattering light. Whereas many of her colleagues narrate US history as a tragedy and a chronicle of oppression, Lepore sets out to capture a fuller range of feeling. Her version features \"a great deal of anguish,\" she admits, but it also contains \"decency and hope,\" \"prosperity and ambition,\" \"invention and beauty.\" Lepore's relatively upbeat tone is more than a sensibility; it's a politics. The Bill O'Reillys of the bookshelf, she insists in This America , have not only taken control of the national story but also claimed for themselves the mantle of patriotism. Lepore wants to take it back for liberals. O'Reilly and his ilk are, in her view, best described not as patriots but as nationalists using the flag as a cloak for their illiberal agendas. True patriots, those who cherish the liberal values of the country, must stand and be counted. Lepore's distinction-\"patriotism is animated by love, nationalism by hatred\"-is not one that holds up well under scrutiny, but her point is clear enough. She hopes that she can tell US history in an inclusive way, staring the cruelties of the past full in the face yet coming out of it with her faith in the country intact. This determination not to cede love of country to the nationalists supplies Lepore with a creed. \"The United States,\" she insists, \"is a nation founded on a deeply moral commitment to human dignity\" and to the proposition that \"all of us are equal.\" What's noteworthy here is not Lepore's celebration of dignity and equality; it's her insistence that such values lie at the core of the United States and always have. But that claim, essential to her patriotism, is hard to square with history. We now have a much better understanding of how central patriarchy, the Indian Wars, and slavery were to the country's founding, and Lepore denies none of this. (She writes that George Washington attended the Constitutional Convention wearing \"dentures made from ivory and from nine teeth pulled from the mouths of his slaves.\") Yet her faith is dauntless. \"Notwithstanding the agony and hypocrisy of the nation's past,\" she insists, \"these truths endure.\" T hese truths endure . Lepore's devotion to the country's core values is a major part of This America . She twice quotes historian Michael Kazin's point that radicals and reformers succeed in the United States only when they appeal to what he calls \"the national belief system.\" Lepore has little patience for those who fail to heed Kazin's advice, for the reformers and radicals who see that the national belief system as an impediment to equality rather than an instrument for achieving it. In These Truths , this comes out particularly clearly in Lepore's treatment of the Black Power movement, which she narrates through the figure of Stokely Carmichael. He began his career with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, as someone for whom political action meant registering voters. But by 1966 he had given up on reforms secured within the existing frame of US politics. \"The reality is that this nation, from top to bottom, is racist,\" he wrote in The New York Review of Books . \"We won't fight to save the present society.\" Lepore regards this position as reckless. She explains that his star wasn't the only one rising; this was also an era when a newly emboldened right emerged. When Carmichael received an invitation in 1966 to speak at the University of California, Berkeley, a California gubernatorial candidate named Ronald Reagan seized on it as a chance to bolster his own campaign. \"We cannot have the university campus used as a base from which to foment riots,\" Reagan declared. Predictably, Carmichael refused to back down, and in so doing, he \"played right into Reagan's hands,\" Lepore laments. The Republican candidate used Carmichael's speech as a wedge issue and won the election handily, triumphing in 55 out of California's 58 counties. It was, she writes with palpable irritation, \"a victory of conservatives over liberals.\" Lepore's pairing of Carmichael and Reagan is telling. Other historians charting the rise of the right have invoked such structural and economic factors as white flight to the suburbs and the rise of corporate-funded think tanks. Her narrative stresses what she views as the ill-advised intransigence of the left. \"With each new form of public protest, Reagan's political capital grew,\" she explains. As campus activists \"descended into disenchantment and a profound alienation from the idea of America itself,\" Republicans fed off that disenchantment. Conservatism surged, she writes, when liberalism faltered because \"the idea of identity replaced the idea of equality.\" We are now risking imminent collapse, Lepore insists. \"The nation has been coming apart.\" One horseman of the apocalypse is the right-wing radio host Alex Jones, who consumes so much of her attention that a reader unfamiliar with history might conclude from These Truths that his arrival in politics was more momentous than the Korean War. Certainly, Jones is a perfect villain for Lepore: Not only is he malicious, but he openly scorns any shared national project. But other illiberal horsemen stalk the land as well. Lepore sounds the alarm over \"left identity politics,\" particularly the campus-based \"alt-left\" (here she uses a Breitbart -favored pejorative), which she regards as comparable to the alt-right. She decries the left's \"meaningless outrage\" and \"sanctimonious accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.\" As an illustration, she describes a Twitter squabble. \"After fourteen people were killed in a terrorist attack on a gay nightclub in San Bernardino, California,\" she writes, \"the alt-left spent its energies in the aftermath of this tragedy attacking one another for breaches of the rules of 'intersectionality,' which involve intricate, identity-based hierarchies of suffering and virtue.\" Twitter users, she continues, responded to the news by angrily correcting newscasters who described the attack as the worst massacre in US history (that would be Wounded Knee, they insisted) and arguing about whether it was ableist to blame the shooting on mental illness. This is a caricature and an uncharacteristically mean one for Lepore, who typically treats her subjects with sympathy. Her account comes secondhand from Angela Nagle's Kill All Normies , and Lepore's garbling of it-conflating the attack on the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino with the mass shooting at Pulse in Orlando, Florida-strongly suggests that she hasn't read the offending tweets herself. I have. They seem far more calm and reasoned in context, and I saw no evidence that they consumed the \"energies\" of the left or set off cascading wokeness competitions. What is more, in reducing the younger left to these tweets, Lepore overlooks its bold environmental and economic agendas. At a time when progressive millennials are achieving extraordinary political success pushing programs like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, Lepore sees them as largely feckless, more likely to sink the ship than steer it. What young leftists fail to recognize, she continues, is how fragile the nation has become. In the decade before the Civil War, New York Senator William Seward warned of an \"irrepressible conflict\" brewing. Lepore quotes him when describing the sharpening of political knives that has been ongoing since the Reagan administration: The 2016 election \"nearly rent the nation in two,\" she writes. Holding it together will require repudiating extremism, affirming core values, and grabbing tight hold of the nation. \"Whether nations can remain liberal,\" she counsels, \"actually depends on the recovery of the many ways of understanding what it means to belong to a nation, and even to love a nation, the place, the people, and the idea itself.\" T he \"irrepressible conflict\" of which Seward warned killed hundreds of thousands, yet it also ended slavery. The war's two faces illustrate the big question at the center of Lepore's view of US history. For her, the United States has professed democratic equality from the start. There is no shortage of what she calls \"hypocrisy\"-the failure to live up to announced values-in its past. But progress has only ever been achieved by affirming the nation and those core values. That is the liberal view, and Lepore isn't alone in seeing things that way. Yet radicals tend to have a different understanding. In their view, the United States-a settler empire carved out of Native lands by rich white men, many of whom enslaved others-was not particularly egalitarian in its origins. If it's a better society today, this is because activists made seemingly unrealistic demands and fought for them. Stark conflict has been essential to progress, and the times of greatest national division-the 1860s, the 1960s and '70s-have also been times of major progressive victories like the abolition of slavery and the establishment of reproductive rights. For a radical, this is not the time to mend rifts or make compromises. It's a time of crisis-and when it comes to the threat of global warming, an existential one. It's also a rare chance to achieve root-and-branch change with regard to the environment, the economy, gender, sexuality, and race. If what is needed is an overhaul rather than an adjustment, then the ideals and methods of 18th century men-\"these truths\"-may not be the best guides. Lepore doesn't disavow radical aims, so her case for nation-centered histories and liberal patriotism is tactical. Global solidarities and widened horizons are fine to contemplate, but there's a reason that books about the nation sell best. To reject the nation is to give up on reaching an audience, on making a difference. Similarly, in her view, radical intentions are laudable, but radical political programs that condemn the nation backfire and inadvertently aid the enemy. In the end, she argues, it is liberals, not radicals, who can deliver progressive change. They do so using the most powerful tool within reach: the nation. The problem is that Lepore is preaching this liberal gospel in increasingly radical times. The Trump presidency and the climate crisis have raised sharp challenges to her worldview. She finds herself in the awkward position of espousing patriotism at a moment of cruel nationalism, of explaining why radicalism doesn't work at just the time radicals on all sides are gaining clout, and of insisting that the nation is the most relevant geographical unit while storms, droughts, and heat waves make a mockery of political borders. In the face of such challenges, Lepore stands firm: The nation and its founding values are a shared heritage, and we must hold fast to them. The epic history she has written from this position is an important one, further evidence (if any were needed) of her prodigious powers. Yet it's hard not to wonder, as the evidence mounts daily that the old rules no longer apply, if the ground that Lepore is digging her heels into isn't an ice shelf, melting beneath her feet.\n\nLepore's national frame consistently directs her readers' gaze inward; it's the history of a \"we.\" She rightly has an inclusive understanding of that \"we,\" but she exhibits little interest in anything outside of it. The Vietnam War, which split the nation, consumes Lepore's attention. The Korean War, which didn't, she barely mentions, even though it permanently divided the Korean Peninsula and may have taken as many Asian lives as the Vietnam War did. Lepore writes ably and critically about the George W. Bush administration's Global War on Terrorism, yet she is more concerned with how the use of torture violated long-standing norms and tarnished national morals than she is with the far more consequential destabilization of the Middle East. Such far-off consequences of US actions are beyond Lepore's remit. In writing These Truths , she confined herself to \"what, in my view, a people constituted as a nation in the early twenty-first century need to know about their own past.\" That sounds sensible. But given that the nation in question is also an empire-with Native American reservations, overseas territories, and hundreds of military bases spread across the planet-perhaps its members should also know a little about the other peoples and pasts this empire has engrossed. They, too, are US history. T here's a reason Lepore doubles down on the nation-on the \"we\"-and it's not that she's ignorant of other approaches. While her colleagues are embarking on their free-form jazz odysseys, decentering the nation by writing books about oceans, most readers still see the world in terms of nations, and they want history written accordingly. \"They can get it from scholars or they can get it from demagogues, but get it they will,\" Lepore warns. She has a point. \"Serious historians,\" as Lepore calls them, are reluctant to deliver single-volume national histories or accounts of the powerful men and wars that shaped the country, but that hasn't stopped the less serious. \"America's bestselling historian,\" according to his publisher, is not a learned professor but former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly.

For a radical, this is not the time to mend rifts or make compromises. It's a time of crisis-and when it comes to the threat of global warming, an existential one. It's also a rare chance to achieve root-and-branch change with regard to the environment, the economy, gender, sexuality, and race. If what is needed is an overhaul rather than an adjustment, then the ideals and methods of 18th century men-\"these truths\"-may not be the best guides. Lepore doesn't disavow radical aims, so her case for nation-centered histories and liberal patriotism is tactical. Global solidarities and widened horizons are fine to contemplate, but there's a reason that books about the nation sell best. To reject the nation is to give up on reaching an audience, on making a difference. Similarly, in her view, radical intentions are laudable, but radical political programs that condemn the nation backfire and inadvertently aid the enemy. In the end, she argues, it is liberals, not radicals, who can deliver progressive change. They do so using the most powerful tool within reach: the nation. The problem is that Lepore is preaching this liberal gospel in increasingly radical times. The Trump presidency and the climate crisis have raised sharp challenges to her worldview. She finds herself in the awkward position of espousing patriotism at a moment of cruel nationalism, of explaining why radicalism doesn't work at just the time radicals on all sides are gaining clout, and of insisting that the nation is the most relevant geographical unit while storms, droughts, and heat waves make a mockery of political borders. In the face of such challenges, Lepore stands firm: The nation and its founding values are a shared heritage, and we must hold fast to them. The epic history she has written from this position is an important one, further evidence (if any were needed) of her prodigious powers. Yet it's hard not to wonder, as the evidence mounts daily that the old rules no longer apply, if the ground that Lepore is digging her heels into isn't an ice shelf, melting beneath her feet.\n\nT here's a reason Lepore doubles down on the nation-on the \"we\"-and it's not that she's ignorant of other approaches. While her colleagues are embarking on their free-form jazz odysseys, decentering the nation by writing books about oceans, most readers still see the world in terms of nations, and they want history written accordingly. \"They can get it from scholars or they can get it from demagogues, but get it they will,\" Lepore warns. She has a point. \"Serious historians,\" as Lepore calls them, are reluctant to deliver single-volume national histories or accounts of the powerful men and wars that shaped the country, but that hasn't stopped the less serious. \"America's bestselling historian,\" according to his publisher, is not a learned professor but former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly. His wildly popular Killing series ( Killing Lincoln , Killing Kennedy , Killing Reagan , etc.), coauthored with Martin Dugard, offers national history in its familiar Father's Day form, just with more gore and less accuracy. Joining O'Reilly and Dugard atop the New York Times best-seller list are Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen, authors of the counter-Zinnian A Patriot's History of the United States . Schweikart can be found these days on Twitter, offering edifying thoughts about the \"DemoKKKrats.\" Driving the demagogues out of the Barnes & Noble will require more than just taking back the nation as an object of serious historical inquiry. Lepore also sees a need to show that object in a more flattering light. Whereas many of her colleagues narrate US history as a tragedy and a chronicle of oppression, Lepore sets out to capture a fuller range of feeling. Her version features \"a great deal of anguish,\" she admits, but it also contains \"decency and hope,\" \"prosperity and ambition,\" \"invention and beauty.\" Lepore's relatively upbeat tone is more than a sensibility; it's a politics. The Bill O'Reillys of the bookshelf, she insists in This America , have not only taken control of the national story but also claimed for themselves the mantle of patriotism. Lepore wants to take it back for liberals. O'Reilly and his ilk are, in her view, best described not as patriots but as nationalists using the flag as a cloak for their illiberal agendas. True patriots, those who cherish the liberal values of the country, must stand and be counted. Lepore's distinction-\"patriotism is animated by love, nationalism by hatred\"-is not one that holds up well under scrutiny, but her point is clear enough. She hopes that she can tell US history in an inclusive way, staring the cruelties of the past full in the face yet coming out of it with her faith in the country intact. This determination not to cede love of country to the nationalists supplies Lepore with a creed. \"The United States,\" she insists, \"is a nation founded on a deeply moral commitment to human dignity\" and to the proposition that \"all of us are equal.\" What's noteworthy here is not Lepore's celebration of dignity and equality; it's her insistence that such values lie at the core of the United States and always have. But that claim, essential to her patriotism, is hard to square with history. We now have a much better understanding of how central patriarchy, the Indian Wars, and slavery were to the country's founding, and Lepore denies none of this. (She writes that George Washington attended the Constitutional Convention wearing \"dentures made from ivory and from nine teeth pulled from the mouths of his slaves.\") Yet her faith is dauntless. \"Notwithstanding the agony and hypocrisy of the nation's past,\" she insists, \"these truths endure.\" T hese truths endure . Lepore's devotion to the country's core values is a major part of This America . She twice quotes historian Michael Kazin's point that radicals and reformers succeed in the United States only when they appeal to what he calls \"the national belief system.\" Lepore has little patience for those who fail to heed Kazin's advice, for the reformers and radicals who see that the national belief system as an impediment to equality rather than an instrument for achieving it. In These Truths , this comes out particularly clearly in Lepore's treatment of the Black Power movement, which she narrates through the figure of Stokely Carmichael. He began his career with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, as someone for whom political action meant registering voters. But by 1966 he had given up on reforms secured within the existing frame of US politics. \"The reality is that this nation, from top to bottom, is racist,\" he wrote in The New York Review of Books . \"We won't fight to save the present society.\" Lepore regards this position as reckless. She explains that his star wasn't the only one rising; this was also an era when a newly emboldened right emerged. When Carmichael received an invitation in 1966 to speak at the University of California, Berkeley, a California gubernatorial candidate named Ronald Reagan seized on it as a chance to bolster his own campaign. \"We cannot have the university campus used as a base from which to foment riots,\" Reagan declared. Predictably, Carmichael refused to back down, and in so doing, he \"played right into Reagan's hands,\" Lepore laments. The Republican candidate used Carmichael's speech as a wedge issue and won the election handily, triumphing in 55 out of California's 58 counties. It was, she writes with palpable irritation, \"a victory of conservatives over liberals.\" Lepore's pairing of Carmichael and Reagan is telling. Other historians charting the rise of the right have invoked such structural and economic factors as white flight to the suburbs and the rise of corporate-funded think tanks. Her narrative stresses what she views as the ill-advised intransigence of the left. \"With each new form of public protest, Reagan's political capital grew,\" she explains. As campus activists \"descended into disenchantment and a profound alienation from the idea of America itself,\" Republicans fed off that disenchantment. Conservatism surged, she writes, when liberalism faltered because \"the idea of identity replaced the idea of equality.\" We are now risking imminent collapse, Lepore insists. \"The nation has been coming apart.\" One horseman of the apocalypse is the right-wing radio host Alex Jones, who consumes so much of her attention that a reader unfamiliar with history might conclude from These Truths that his arrival in politics was more momentous than the Korean War. Certainly, Jones is a perfect villain for Lepore: Not only is he malicious, but he openly scorns any shared national project. But other illiberal horsemen stalk the land as well. Lepore sounds the alarm over \"left identity politics,\" particularly the campus-based \"alt-left\" (here she uses a Breitbart -favored pejorative), which she regards as comparable to the alt-right. She decries the left's \"meaningless outrage\" and \"sanctimonious accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.\" As an illustration, she describes a Twitter squabble. \"After fourteen people were killed in a terrorist attack on a gay nightclub in San Bernardino, California,\" she writes, \"the alt-left spent its energies in the aftermath of this tragedy attacking one another for breaches of the rules of 'intersectionality,' which involve intricate, identity-based hierarchies of suffering and virtue.\" Twitter users, she continues, responded to the news by angrily correcting newscasters who described the attack as the worst massacre in US history (that would be Wounded Knee, they insisted) and arguing about whether it was ableist to blame the shooting on mental illness. This is a caricature and an uncharacteristically mean one for Lepore, who typically treats her subjects with sympathy. Her account comes secondhand from Angela Nagle's Kill All Normies , and Lepore's garbling of it-conflating the attack on the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino with the mass shooting at Pulse in Orlando, Florida-strongly suggests that she hasn't read the offending tweets herself. I have. They seem far more calm and reasoned in context, and I saw no evidence that they consumed the \"energies\" of the left or set off cascading wokeness competitions. What is more, in reducing the younger left to these tweets, Lepore overlooks its bold environmental and economic agendas. At a time when progressive millennials are achieving extraordinary political success pushing programs like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, Lepore sees them as largely feckless, more likely to sink the ship than steer it. What young leftists fail to recognize, she continues, is how fragile the nation has become. In the decade before the Civil War, New York Senator William Seward warned of an \"irrepressible conflict\" brewing. Lepore quotes him when describing the sharpening of political knives that has been ongoing since the Reagan administration: The 2016 election \"nearly rent the nation in two,\" she writes. Holding it together will require repudiating extremism, affirming core values, and grabbing tight hold of the nation. \"Whether nations can remain liberal,\" she counsels, \"actually depends on the recovery of the many ways of understanding what it means to belong to a nation, and even to love a nation, the place, the people, and the idea itself.\" T he \"irrepressible conflict\" of which Seward warned killed hundreds of thousands, yet it also ended slavery. The war's two faces illustrate the big question at the center of Lepore's view of US history. For her, the United States has professed democratic equality from the start. There is no shortage of what she calls \"hypocrisy\"-the failure to live up to announced values-in its past. But progress has only ever been achieved by affirming the nation and those core values. That is the liberal view, and Lepore isn't alone in seeing things that way. Yet radicals tend to have a different understanding. In their view, the United States-a settler empire carved out of Native lands by rich white men, many of whom enslaved others-was not particularly egalitarian in its origins. If it's a better society today, this is because activists made seemingly unrealistic demands and fought for them. Stark conflict has been essential to progress, and the times of greatest national division-the 1860s, the 1960s and '70s-have also been times of major progressive victories like the abolition of slavery and the establishment of reproductive rights.

To reject the nation is to give up on reaching an audience, on making a difference. Similarly, in her view, radical intentions are laudable, but radical political programs that condemn the nation backfire and inadvertently aid the enemy. In the end, she argues, it is liberals, not radicals, who can deliver progressive change. They do so using the most powerful tool within reach: the nation. The problem is that Lepore is preaching this liberal gospel in increasingly radical times. The Trump presidency and the climate crisis have raised sharp challenges to her worldview. She finds herself in the awkward position of espousing patriotism at a moment of cruel nationalism, of explaining why radicalism doesn't work at just the time radicals on all sides are gaining clout, and of insisting that the nation is the most relevant geographical unit while storms, droughts, and heat waves make a mockery of political borders. In the face of such challenges, Lepore stands firm: The nation and its founding values are a shared heritage, and we must hold fast to them. The epic history she has written from this position is an important one, further evidence (if any were needed) of her prodigious powers. Yet it's hard not to wonder, as the evidence mounts daily that the old rules no longer apply, if the ground that Lepore is digging her heels into isn't an ice shelf, melting beneath her feet.\n\nLepore's relatively upbeat tone is more than a sensibility; it's a politics. The Bill O'Reillys of the bookshelf, she insists in This America , have not only taken control of the national story but also claimed for themselves the mantle of patriotism. Lepore wants to take it back for liberals. O'Reilly and his ilk are, in her view, best described not as patriots but as nationalists using the flag as a cloak for their illiberal agendas. True patriots, those who cherish the liberal values of the country, must stand and be counted. Lepore's distinction-\"patriotism is animated by love, nationalism by hatred\"-is not one that holds up well under scrutiny, but her point is clear enough. She hopes that she can tell US history in an inclusive way, staring the cruelties of the past full in the face yet coming out of it with her faith in the country intact. This determination not to cede love of country to the nationalists supplies Lepore with a creed. \"The United States,\" she insists, \"is a nation founded on a deeply moral commitment to human dignity\" and to the proposition that \"all of us are equal.\" What's noteworthy here is not Lepore's celebration of dignity and equality; it's her insistence that such values lie at the core of the United States and always have. But that claim, essential to her patriotism, is hard to square with history. We now have a much better understanding of how central patriarchy, the Indian Wars, and slavery were to the country's founding, and Lepore denies none of this. (She writes that George Washington attended the Constitutional Convention wearing \"dentures made from ivory and from nine teeth pulled from the mouths of his slaves.\") Yet her faith is dauntless. \"Notwithstanding the agony and hypocrisy of the nation's past,\" she insists, \"these truths endure.\" T hese truths endure . Lepore's devotion to the country's core values is a major part of This America . She twice quotes historian Michael Kazin's point that radicals and reformers succeed in the United States only when they appeal to what he calls \"the national belief system.\" Lepore has little patience for those who fail to heed Kazin's advice, for the reformers and radicals who see that the national belief system as an impediment to equality rather than an instrument for achieving it. In These Truths , this comes out particularly clearly in Lepore's treatment of the Black Power movement, which she narrates through the figure of Stokely Carmichael. He began his career with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, as someone for whom political action meant registering voters. But by 1966 he had given up on reforms secured within the existing frame of US politics. \"The reality is that this nation, from top to bottom, is racist,\" he wrote in The New York Review of Books . \"We won't fight to save the present society.\" Lepore regards this position as reckless. She explains that his star wasn't the only one rising; this was also an era when a newly emboldened right emerged. When Carmichael received an invitation in 1966 to speak at the University of California, Berkeley, a California gubernatorial candidate named Ronald Reagan seized on it as a chance to bolster his own campaign. \"We cannot have the university campus used as a base from which to foment riots,\" Reagan declared. Predictably, Carmichael refused to back down, and in so doing, he \"played right into Reagan's hands,\" Lepore laments. The Republican candidate used Carmichael's speech as a wedge issue and won the election handily, triumphing in 55 out of California's 58 counties. It was, she writes with palpable irritation, \"a victory of conservatives over liberals.\" Lepore's pairing of Carmichael and Reagan is telling. Other historians charting the rise of the right have invoked such structural and economic factors as white flight to the suburbs and the rise of corporate-funded think tanks. Her narrative stresses what she views as the ill-advised intransigence of the left. \"With each new form of public protest, Reagan's political capital grew,\" she explains. As campus activists \"descended into disenchantment and a profound alienation from the idea of America itself,\" Republicans fed off that disenchantment. Conservatism surged, she writes, when liberalism faltered because \"the idea of identity replaced the idea of equality.\" We are now risking imminent collapse, Lepore insists. \"The nation has been coming apart.\" One horseman of the apocalypse is the right-wing radio host Alex Jones, who consumes so much of her attention that a reader unfamiliar with history might conclude from These Truths that his arrival in politics was more momentous than the Korean War. Certainly, Jones is a perfect villain for Lepore: Not only is he malicious, but he openly scorns any shared national project. But other illiberal horsemen stalk the land as well. Lepore sounds the alarm over \"left identity politics,\" particularly the campus-based \"alt-left\" (here she uses a Breitbart -favored pejorative), which she regards as comparable to the alt-right. She decries the left's \"meaningless outrage\" and \"sanctimonious accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.\" As an illustration, she describes a Twitter squabble. \"After fourteen people were killed in a terrorist attack on a gay nightclub in San Bernardino, California,\" she writes, \"the alt-left spent its energies in the aftermath of this tragedy attacking one another for breaches of the rules of 'intersectionality,' which involve intricate, identity-based hierarchies of suffering and virtue.\" Twitter users, she continues, responded to the news by angrily correcting newscasters who described the attack as the worst massacre in US history (that would be Wounded Knee, they insisted) and arguing about whether it was ableist to blame the shooting on mental illness. This is a caricature and an uncharacteristically mean one for Lepore, who typically treats her subjects with sympathy. Her account comes secondhand from Angela Nagle's Kill All Normies , and Lepore's garbling of it-conflating the attack on the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino with the mass shooting at Pulse in Orlando, Florida-strongly suggests that she hasn't read the offending tweets herself. I have. They seem far more calm and reasoned in context, and I saw no evidence that they consumed the \"energies\" of the left or set off cascading wokeness competitions. What is more, in reducing the younger left to these tweets, Lepore overlooks its bold environmental and economic agendas. At a time when progressive millennials are achieving extraordinary political success pushing programs like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, Lepore sees them as largely feckless, more likely to sink the ship than steer it. What young leftists fail to recognize, she continues, is how fragile the nation has become. In the decade before the Civil War, New York Senator William Seward warned of an \"irrepressible conflict\" brewing. Lepore quotes him when describing the sharpening of political knives that has been ongoing since the Reagan administration: The 2016 election \"nearly rent the nation in two,\" she writes. Holding it together will require repudiating extremism, affirming core values, and grabbing tight hold of the nation. \"Whether nations can remain liberal,\" she counsels, \"actually depends on the recovery of the many ways of understanding what it means to belong to a nation, and even to love a nation, the place, the people, and the idea itself.\" T he \"irrepressible conflict\" of which Seward warned killed hundreds of thousands, yet it also ended slavery. The war's two faces illustrate the big question at the center of Lepore's view of US history. For her, the United States has professed democratic equality from the start. There is no shortage of what she calls \"hypocrisy\"-the failure to live up to announced values-in its past. But progress has only ever been achieved by affirming the nation and those core values. That is the liberal view, and Lepore isn't alone in seeing things that way. Yet radicals tend to have a different understanding. In their view, the United States-a settler empire carved out of Native lands by rich white men, many of whom enslaved others-was not particularly egalitarian in its origins. If it's a better society today, this is because activists made seemingly unrealistic demands and fought for them. Stark conflict has been essential to progress, and the times of greatest national division-the 1860s, the 1960s and '70s-have also been times of major progressive victories like the abolition of slavery and the establishment of reproductive rights. For a radical, this is not the time to mend rifts or make compromises. It's a time of crisis-and when it comes to the threat of global warming, an existential one. It's also a rare chance to achieve root-and-branch change with regard to the environment, the economy, gender, sexuality, and race. If what is needed is an overhaul rather than an adjustment, then the ideals and methods of 18th century men-\"these truths\"-may not be the best guides. Lepore doesn't disavow radical aims, so her case for nation-centered histories and liberal patriotism is tactical. Global solidarities and widened horizons are fine to contemplate, but there's a reason that books about the nation sell best.

Stark conflict has been essential to progress, and the times of greatest national division-the 1860s, the 1960s and '70s-have also been times of major progressive victories like the abolition of slavery and the establishment of reproductive rights. For a radical, this is not the time to mend rifts or make compromises. It's a time of crisis-and when it comes to the threat of global warming, an existential one. It's also a rare chance to achieve root-and-branch change with regard to the environment, the economy, gender, sexuality, and race. If what is needed is an overhaul rather than an adjustment, then the ideals and methods of 18th century men-\"these truths\"-may not be the best guides. Lepore doesn't disavow radical aims, so her case for nation-centered histories and liberal patriotism is tactical. Global solidarities and widened horizons are fine to contemplate, but there's a reason that books about the nation sell best. To reject the nation is to give up on reaching an audience, on making a difference. Similarly, in her view, radical intentions are laudable, but radical political programs that condemn the nation backfire and inadvertently aid the enemy. In the end, she argues, it is liberals, not radicals, who can deliver progressive change. They do so using the most powerful tool within reach: the nation. The problem is that Lepore is preaching this liberal gospel in increasingly radical times. The Trump presidency and the climate crisis have raised sharp challenges to her worldview. She finds herself in the awkward position of espousing patriotism at a moment of cruel nationalism, of explaining why radicalism doesn't work at just the time radicals on all sides are gaining clout, and of insisting that the nation is the most relevant geographical unit while storms, droughts, and heat waves make a mockery of political borders. In the face of such challenges, Lepore stands firm: The nation and its founding values are a shared heritage, and we must hold fast to them. The epic history she has written from this position is an important one, further evidence (if any were needed) of her prodigious powers. Yet it's hard not to wonder, as the evidence mounts daily that the old rules no longer apply, if the ground that Lepore is digging her heels into isn't an ice shelf, melting beneath her feet.\n\nLepore regards this position as reckless. She explains that his star wasn't the only one rising; this was also an era when a newly emboldened right emerged. When Carmichael received an invitation in 1966 to speak at the University of California, Berkeley, a California gubernatorial candidate named Ronald Reagan seized on it as a chance to bolster his own campaign. \"We cannot have the university campus used as a base from which to foment riots,\" Reagan declared. Predictably, Carmichael refused to back down, and in so doing, he \"played right into Reagan's hands,\" Lepore laments. The Republican candidate used Carmichael's speech as a wedge issue and won the election handily, triumphing in 55 out of California's 58 counties. It was, she writes with palpable irritation, \"a victory of conservatives over liberals.\" Lepore's pairing of Carmichael and Reagan is telling. Other historians charting the rise of the right have invoked such structural and economic factors as white flight to the suburbs and the rise of corporate-funded think tanks. Her narrative stresses what she views as the ill-advised intransigence of the left. \"With each new form of public protest, Reagan's political capital grew,\" she explains. As campus activists \"descended into disenchantment and a profound alienation from the idea of America itself,\" Republicans fed off that disenchantment. Conservatism surged, she writes, when liberalism faltered because \"the idea of identity replaced the idea of equality.\" We are now risking imminent collapse, Lepore insists. \"The nation has been coming apart.\" One horseman of the apocalypse is the right-wing radio host Alex Jones, who consumes so much of her attention that a reader unfamiliar with history might conclude from These Truths that his arrival in politics was more momentous than the Korean War. Certainly, Jones is a perfect villain for Lepore: Not only is he malicious, but he openly scorns any shared national project. But other illiberal horsemen stalk the land as well. Lepore sounds the alarm over \"left identity politics,\" particularly the campus-based \"alt-left\" (here she uses a Breitbart -favored pejorative), which she regards as comparable to the alt-right. She decries the left's \"meaningless outrage\" and \"sanctimonious accusations of racism, sexism, homophobia, and transphobia.\" As an illustration, she describes a Twitter squabble. \"After fourteen people were killed in a terrorist attack on a gay nightclub in San Bernardino, California,\" she writes, \"the alt-left spent its energies in the aftermath of this tragedy attacking one another for breaches of the rules of 'intersectionality,' which involve intricate, identity-based hierarchies of suffering and virtue.\" Twitter users, she continues, responded to the news by angrily correcting newscasters who described the attack as the worst massacre in US history (that would be Wounded Knee, they insisted) and arguing about whether it was ableist to blame the shooting on mental illness. This is a caricature and an uncharacteristically mean one for Lepore, who typically treats her subjects with sympathy. Her account comes secondhand from Angela Nagle's Kill All Normies , and Lepore's garbling of it-conflating the attack on the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino with the mass shooting at Pulse in Orlando, Florida-strongly suggests that she hasn't read the offending tweets herself. I have. They seem far more calm and reasoned in context, and I saw no evidence that they consumed the \"energies\" of the left or set off cascading wokeness competitions. What is more, in reducing the younger left to these tweets, Lepore overlooks its bold environmental and economic agendas. At a time when progressive millennials are achieving extraordinary political success pushing programs like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, Lepore sees them as largely feckless, more likely to sink the ship than steer it. What young leftists fail to recognize, she continues, is how fragile the nation has become. In the decade before the Civil War, New York Senator William Seward warned of an \"irrepressible conflict\" brewing. Lepore quotes him when describing the sharpening of political knives that has been ongoing since the Reagan administration: The 2016 election \"nearly rent the nation in two,\" she writes. Holding it together will require repudiating extremism, affirming core values, and grabbing tight hold of the nation. \"Whether nations can remain liberal,\" she counsels, \"actually depends on the recovery of the many ways of understanding what it means to belong to a nation, and even to love a nation, the place, the people, and the idea itself.\" T he \"irrepressible conflict\" of which Seward warned killed hundreds of thousands, yet it also ended slavery. The war's two faces illustrate the big question at the center of Lepore's view of US history. For her, the United States has professed democratic equality from the start. There is no shortage of what she calls \"hypocrisy\"-the failure to live up to announced values-in its past. But progress has only ever been achieved by affirming the nation and those core values. That is the liberal view, and Lepore isn't alone in seeing things that way. Yet radicals tend to have a different understanding. In their view, the United States-a settler empire carved out of Native lands by rich white men, many of whom enslaved others-was not particularly egalitarian in its origins. If it's a better society today, this is because activists made seemingly unrealistic demands and fought for them.

The war's two faces illustrate the big question at the center of Lepore's view of US history. For her, the United States has professed democratic equality from the start. There is no shortage of what she calls \"hypocrisy\"-the failure to live up to announced values-in its past. But progress has only ever been achieved by affirming the nation and those core values. That is the liberal view, and Lepore isn't alone in seeing things that way. Yet radicals tend to have a different understanding. In their view, the United States-a settler empire carved out of Native lands by rich white men, many of whom enslaved others-was not particularly egalitarian in its origins. If it's a better society today, this is because activists made seemingly unrealistic demands and fought for them. Stark conflict has been essential to progress, and the times of greatest national division-the 1860s, the 1960s and '70s-have also been times of major progressive victories like the abolition of slavery and the establishment of reproductive rights. For a radical, this is not the time to mend rifts or make compromises. It's a time of crisis-and when it comes to the threat of global warming, an existential one. It's also a rare chance to achieve root-and-branch change with regard to the environment, the economy, gender, sexuality, and race.

Activate your online access\n\nThe Manhattan court case clarifies the stakes-and gives a chance for a Biden reboot.\n\nAfter a lifetime of relentless chicanery, business fraud, thuggery, tax evasion, all-purpose crookery, and sexual assault, Donald Trump is finally-belatedly, but still gratifyingly-a convicted felon. The impunity that Trump has enjoyed, thanks to his status from birth as a rich white man, has always been galling. It's been an affront to common decency and the hope that the universe has at least a modicum of justice. Trump's evasion of the law has fed a poisonous cynicism, one that saps the will to make the world a better place.\n\nGiven these facts, our reaction to the jury's verdict of guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records as part of a cover-up of a sex scandal has to be not just political but emotional too. Like the liberated munchkins of Oz, it's easy to imagine breaking out into song: \"Ding-dong, the witch is dead!\" Of course, Trump hasn't breathed his last yet, so perhaps we should save that particular celebratory rite for a future happy day. But Trump has been wounded, in a way that will change the political dynamics of his vindictive bid to return to the White House.\n\nBecause of the pervasive cynicism Trump has always inspired-and also because he has so long evaded accountability-there is already a knowing, wise-guy deflation of the impact. People who have excessive pride in their own cleverness are downplaying the news, suggesting that a criminal conviction, especially for a complicated paperwork crime growing out of an ancient sexual peccadillo, won't hurt Trump at all. The suggestion has even been made that his status as a convicted felon could actually help Trump, with his supporters so fired up by grievance politics that they flood to the voting booths to vindicate their hero.\n\nThus, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni argues that, while an ordinary politician would be sent to the \"political grave\" by a criminal conviction,\n\nI could see [Donald Trump] skipping out of the cemetery, all the way back to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. I could see \"guilty\" being a mere bump in the road. I could even see it being an accelerant, as his indictment arguably was.\n\nThe element of truth here is that Trump was in fact helped in the Republican primaries by his numerous indictments. But the Republican primaries were dominated by MAGA voters, particularly non-college-educated whites, who shared Trump's brand of anti-system politics. For such voters, Trump's indictments were indeed a positive: They showed he was up against pro-establishment forces, the \"deep state\" of Trump's imagination (in truth, to the extent that there is a deep state in law enforcement and the permanent bureaucracy, it has usually given Trump a free ride).\n\nAnti-system voters of this sort are increasingly strong in the Republican base-but they are by no means numerous enough to win a general election. The one election Trump won was in 2016, when he was not running against the deep state but rather had a tightly focused message of economic populism that resonated with Midwestern voters who had been hurt by Bill Clinton's trade agreements. In 2024, Trump has been running a very different campaign, and the difference will only intensify as the fact of his criminal conviction starts to define him as a candidate. This time around, Trump is running not as a tribune-however fraudulent-of economic populism but as the candidate of personal grievance and revenge. The premise is that his reelection will redeem both himself and the lawbreakers who tried to overthrow the 2020 election results on January 6, 2021. Trump's current campaign of payback has a less broad appeal than his earlier voicing of anger at economic injustice. If he's currently leading in the polls, its because of nostalgia for the pre-Covid robust economy rather than any program he's offering. As such, Trump would be more vulnerable now to an anti-nostalgia campaign that reminds voters of the many reasons he was unpopular in the past.\n\nTrump's criminal conviction clarifies the election-and raises the stakes. Do Americans really want a convicted felon as president? Like my colleagues Joan Walsh and Sasha Abramsky , I am skeptical.\n\nThe political analyst Josh Cohen, who blogs at Ettingermentum Newsletter , notes that polls show Trump losing votes if convicted, but with some variation: A New York Times poll asking what would happen if Trump were convicted and imprisoned showed a 14-point shift away from Trump. This would amount to a landslide for Biden. But it's unlikely that Trump will be jailed before the election. A Wall Street Journal poll asking only about conviction shows just a five-point shift from Trump, significant enough to win the election for Biden, but no landslide.\n\nAs Cohen writes:\n\nDo we have any proof that these swings may happen? Well, the polls-the same exact polls that have shown Biden down for more than half a year-say they will. While Race To The White House's national polling average currently has Trump slightly ahead by less than one point, their average of a Biden v. Convicted Trump race has Biden up by 5. It may not be the gargantuan swings some of us hoped for, but make no mistake. If this is true, it will completely transform the race from a tossup to one where Biden is on a clear path to victory.\n\nThe Biden campaign had been flailing before the conviction, with many Democrats starting to panic at the president's persistent weakness in swing states. Trump's conviction is a chance for a Biden reboot, launching a campaign that offers a stark choice between Trump and Biden, with all of Trump's least appealing qualities-his dishonesty, his self-centeredness, his belief that he doesn't have to play by the normal rules that apply to other people-now at the center of attention. This alone won't win the election, which is likely to remain close. Biden will still need to repair his support with groups that have been alienated by his presidency: progressives, young people, and people of color. But Biden now has an opportunity to launch a new campaign, to win over those voters-and keep a convicted felon out of the White House.\n\nPrior to the conviction, most Americans had tuned out the political news. This will be impossible now. In a real sense, Trump's conviction is the true start of the 2024 presidential race.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

You can read our Privacy Policy here.\n\nAs NBA players are making symbolic political statements on the court in response to Donald Sterling's recorded racist rant, 1968 Olympian John Carlos's name has been repeatedly referenced in columns and on social media. After all, it was the stand of John Carlos and Tommie Smith after their 200-meter race at the Mexico City Olympics that has become the go-to template for athletic protest over the last forty-five years. Many are using Carlos's example to state authoritatively what the Clippers players should or should not have done before their playoff game last Sunday. Some folks are saying that if John Carlos were on the Clippers, they would have boycotted the game. Others have said that if John Carlos were there they would have sat on the floor or walked off the court after the opening tip. People have been talking about John Carlos as if it were a doctrinal \"what would Jesus do?\" kind of discussion. This was coupled with a series of moralistic articles- including this doozy from The New York Times -about all that the players should have done. Meanwhile, here is John Carlos, 68 years young, living in Georgia, and it seemed like no one was actually asking him what he thinks. I called Dr. Carlos and, sure enough, he told me I was the first person to seek out this thoughts about Donald Sterling, the symbolic stand of the Clippers and even more Like so many of us, he sounded weary at yet another instance of what Kareem Abdul Jabbar called \"the latest in a long line of rich white celebrities to come out of the racist closet.\" \"It's just terrible we still have a situation like this, a world like this,\" Carlos said. \"It sheds light on where we are.\" With so many people comparing-negatively-the Clippers warm-up protest to his own radical stance in 1968, it might surprise people to know that he was impressed by their actions. \"I think they made a statement that showed they couldn't walk away and do nothing. They made their statement. They could only do so much because they had to come together collectively. Tommie [Smith] and I only had to agree with each other. They had to get twelve people on the same page and show that they as a team were going to act as one. That's not easy and they should be commended for making their dissatisfaction clear.\" But, for John Carlos, what happens next is far more important than any symbolic protest. He called for a series of very specific actions by fans, players and the other NBA owners. \"I don't know how if you are a fan of this Clippers team, you can show up to these games and put money in this man's pockets. He said he does not want you there if you look like me or my family. But a boycott is not just for fans who are black. It is all fans of conscience: black, brown and white. I know people are going to say, 'You're going there to support the players, not Sterling.' But you have to know you are putting money in his pocket.\" As for the players on that team, Dr. Carlos said that they should say publicly, \"We are going for it. We are going to try and win this championship. But whether we win or lose, we are going to be in that man's office the day after the season ends and demand a trade. Every single one of us.\" Then there are the owners and Commissioner Adam Silver. \"The new commissioner has sounded lawyerly and tentative. But let's see if he moves decisively. I hope they have a clause where they can demand that he sell his team. You think about [former Cincinnati Reds owner] Marge Schott. The other baseball owners forced her out and that was some years ago. The deal is this. The NBA has to say there is no place for Donald Sterling. Short of that, they are sending the wrong message.\" John Carlos had one last thought that he wanted me to share as well. \"Why aren't people making a bigger deal about this man's womanizing and the way he treats women? Look how Tiger Woods was treated [by the media] and look at Donald Sterling. He is getting a pass on that part of this, and I don't like it.\" So to sum up, Dr. Carlos thinks the fans should boycott, the players should demand trades and the owners should take Sterling's team. I think we perhaps can see why a lot of mainstream outlets have not asked for his thoughts. But these are certainly ideas that many people both inside and outside the NBA share.\n\nMeanwhile, here is John Carlos, 68 years young, living in Georgia, and it seemed like no one was actually asking him what he thinks.

Every single one of us.\" Then there are the owners and Commissioner Adam Silver. \"The new commissioner has sounded lawyerly and tentative. But let's see if he moves decisively. I hope they have a clause where they can demand that he sell his team. You think about [former Cincinnati Reds owner] Marge Schott. The other baseball owners forced her out and that was some years ago. The deal is this. The NBA has to say there is no place for Donald Sterling. Short of that, they are sending the wrong message.\" John Carlos had one last thought that he wanted me to share as well. \"Why aren't people making a bigger deal about this man's womanizing and the way he treats women? Look how Tiger Woods was treated [by the media] and look at Donald Sterling. He is getting a pass on that part of this, and I don't like it.\" So to sum up, Dr. Carlos thinks the fans should boycott, the players should demand trades and the owners should take Sterling's team. I think we perhaps can see why a lot of mainstream outlets have not asked for his thoughts. But these are certainly ideas that many people both inside and outside the NBA share.\n\nWith so many people comparing-negatively-the Clippers warm-up protest to his own radical stance in 1968, it might surprise people to know that he was impressed by their actions. \"I think they made a statement that showed they couldn't walk away and do nothing. They made their statement. They could only do so much because they had to come together collectively. Tommie [Smith] and I only had to agree with each other. They had to get twelve people on the same page and show that they as a team were going to act as one. That's not easy and they should be commended for making their dissatisfaction clear.\" But, for John Carlos, what happens next is far more important than any symbolic protest. He called for a series of very specific actions by fans, players and the other NBA owners. \"I don't know how if you are a fan of this Clippers team, you can show up to these games and put money in this man's pockets. He said he does not want you there if you look like me or my family. But a boycott is not just for fans who are black. It is all fans of conscience: black, brown and white. I know people are going to say, 'You're going there to support the players, not Sterling.' But you have to know you are putting money in his pocket.\" As for the players on that team, Dr. Carlos said that they should say publicly, \"We are going for it.

Coincidentally, they are also the people who control Wall Street, Congress, and the White House.\n\nThe poll defined \"old\" as \"45 or older.\"  Many will take issue with that definition, but those old white men supported McCain over Obama 48-42 per cent.  White men under 45, in contrast, supported Obama, 50-43.  And white women supported Obama, 45-42, whatever their age.\n\nThe poll also shows that rich white people are even more likely to support McCain - no surprise.  Here the poll defined \"rich\" as earning $50,000 or more.  Most will take issue with that definition, but those rich white people supported McCain 49-42.  (The poll did not provide separate figures for women and men among rich old white people- probably their sample was not big enough.)\n\nBy signing up, you confirm that you are over the age of 16 and agree to receive occasional promotional offers for programs that support The Nation 's journalism.

(The poll did not provide separate figures for women and men among rich old white people- probably their sample was not big enough.) White Protestants are even more likely to support McCain, according to the poll: they split 55-34 for McCain.  White Catholics in contrast supported Obama, 53-46. Extrapolating from these figures, we can conclude that rich old white Protestant men are the base of McCain's support - and thus the number one problem in American politics today. The poll did contain some signs of progress, even for old white men: fewer of them support McCain than supported George W. Bush four years ago.  62 per cent of old white men voted for Bush in 2004, according to the poll, while only 48 percent plan to vote for McCain this year - a switch of 14 per cent of old white men from the \"problem\" category to the \"part of the solution\" group. The shift away from the Republicans among old white men was dwarfed by the figure for young white men.  Their support for the Republican candidate fell from 62 percent in 2004 to 43 per cent today-a whopping 19 percent switch away from the \"problem\" category.  Young white men today prefer Obama, 50-43. Another recent poll shows Obama winning more white voters than any Democrat in three decades.  The Gallup Poll shows 44 percent of non-Hispanic white voters supporting Obama. Politico's David Paul Kuhn calls that \"the highest number for a Democrat since 47 percent of whites backed Jimmy Carter in 1976.\"  It's more than Bill Clinton got in 1996, when he won the support of 43 per cent of whites and 38 per cent of white men.  The peak support for a Democrat among white voters was for Lyndon Johnson in 1964, who won more than 50 per cent. The New York Times -CBS News poll was released October 24 and showed that the split among all registered voters was 52 per cent for Obama, 37 for McCain.\n\nThe latest New York Times -CBS News poll identifies the demographic group with the highest level of support for John McCain: rich old white men.

The researchers conduct thousands of interviews and identify the different clusters American voters fall into.\n\nMore in Common has just completed a large such typology. It's one of the best I've seen because it understands that American politics is no longer about what health care plan you support. It's about identity, psychology, moral foundations and the dynamics of tribal resentment.\n\nThe report, \"Hidden Tribes,\" breaks Americans into seven groups, from left to right, with names like Traditional Liberals, Moderates, Politically Disengaged and so on. It won't surprise you to learn that the most active groups are on the extremes - Progressive Activists on the left (8 percent of Americans) and Devoted Conservatives on the right (6 percent).\n\nThese two groups are the richest of all the groups. They are the whitest of the groups. Their members have among the highest education levels, and they report high levels of persona l security .\n\nWe sometimes think of this as a populist moment. But that's not true. My first big takeaway from \"Hidden Tribes\" is that our political conflict is primarily a rich, white civil war. It's between privileged progressives and privileged conservatives.\n\nYou could say that tribalism is the fruit of privilege. People with more stresses in their lives necessarily pay less attention to politics. People with college degrees are more likely to describe their ideology as central to their identity. They are much more likely to derive moral meaning from their label, more likely to affiliate with a herd based on their label and more likely to vote on the party line.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "In Surge in Manhattan Toddlers, Rich White Families Lead Way\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Sam Roberts\n\nManhattan, which once epitomized the glamorous and largely childless locale for \"Sex and the City,\" has begun to look more like the set for a decidedly upscale and even more vanilla version of 1960s suburbia in \"The Wonder Years.\"\n\nSince 2000, according to census figures released last year, the number of children under age 5 living in Manhattan mushroomed by more than 32 percent. And though their ranks have been growing for several years, a new analysis for The New York Times makes clear for the first time who has been driving that growth: wealthy white families.\n\nAt least half of the growth was generated by children who are white and non-Hispanic. Their ranks expanded by more than 40 percent from 2000 to 2005. For the first time since at least the 1960s, white children now outnumber either black or Hispanic youngsters in that age group in Manhattan.\n\nThe analysis shows that Manhattan's 35,000 or so white non-Hispanic toddlers are being raised by parents whose median income was $284,208 a year in 2005, which means they are growing up in wealthier households than similar youngsters in any other large county in the country.\n\nAmong white families with toddlers, San Francisco ranked second, with a median income of $150,763, followed by Somerset, N.J. ($136,807); San Jose, Calif. ($134,668); Fairfield, Conn. ($132,427); and Westchester ($122,240).\n\nIn comparison, the median income of other Manhattan households with toddlers was $66,213 for Asians, $31,171 for blacks and $25,467 for Hispanic families.\n\nWhat those findings imply, demographers say, is not only that the socioeconomic gap between Manhattan and the other boroughs is widening, but also that the population of Manhattan, in some ways, is beginning to look more like the suburbs  or what they used to look like  than like the rest of the city.\n\n\"We knew Manhattan was having a baby boom,\" said Andrew A. Beveridge, a demographer at Queens College of the City University of New York, who conducted the analysis. \"Now we know who's having the babies.\"\n\nChildren under 5 now account for more than 1 in 20 Manhattan residents, about the same proportion as in Queens and Staten Island. Married couples in Manhattan are just as likely to have young children living at home as in the rest of the city and the metropolitan area.\n\nWhites now account for about 35 percent of the youngest children in Manhattan, compared with about 24 percent for the city as a whole.\n\nThe raw numbers are subject to interpretation, but, coupled with anecdotal evidence, what they generally suggest is that more well-to-do Manhattanites who might otherwise have moved to the suburbs with their children are choosing to raise them in the city, at least early on.\n\nCompared with those in the rest of the city, the youngest children in Manhattan are more likely to be raised by married couples who are well off, more highly educated, in their 30s and native born.\n\n\"This differs from the rest of New York City and the suburbs, where small kids are present among a more diverse array of economic and demographic groups  single-parent families, renters, those in their early 20s with low to middle income,\" said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\"Clearly having kids in Manhattan is a luxury for only those that can truly afford it,\" he said. \"Others with small toddlers avoided or left Manhattan in favor of more affordable cities or suburban communities.\"\n\nIn 1989, the median income of similar Manhattan parents with the youngest children, adjusted to 2005 dollars, was $143,000. As recently as 1999, the median was $187,000.\n\nSince 1989, the proportion of families making more than $200,000 a year (in current dollars) in Manhattan about doubled. Since 1999, the share making less than $50,000 dropped below half of the households in Manhattan.\n\nSome advocates of affordable housing say the trend toward Manhattan becoming more wealthy and white is another troubling sign that longtime lower-income and minority communities will inevitably be displaced by gentrification.\n\nBut Fred Siegel, a history professor at Cooper Union, said a growing population of upper-middle-class residents was an asset. \"How different it makes Manhattan from other cities,\" Mr. Siegel said.\n\nKenneth T. Jackson, a Columbia University historian, said: \"Imagine the reverse  that nobody with money wants to live here, and then you have Detroit. I don't see how anybody benefits in that circumstance.\"\n\nProfessor Siegel said that until now, at least the cost of private school and the demand for space prompted many parents to move when their children got older.\n\nAmong those intent on remaining in Manhattan are Bill Rosenblatt and Jessica Lustig.\n\nMr. Rosenblatt is a management consultant. Ms. Lustig, his wife, markets classical music. They have a son in preschool and a daughter in kindergarten. The couple grew up elsewhere, now live on the Upper West Side and never want to leave Manhattan, where they enjoy being near both work and their children.\n\n\"We're grappling with what we do in a few years when the kids are no longer able to share a bedroom, said Mr. Rosenblatt, who is 45. \"We have financial planners, but it's certainly an issue we wouldn't have if we lived in the suburbs.\"\n\nMs. Lustig, 40, agreed. \"The only reason we would move is because we couldn't afford to stay any longer, and I'd cry my eyes out,\" she said. \"The kids don't miss what they don't have. Riverside Park is their backyard.\"\n\nA number of parents also said that even if Manhattan was becoming less affordable for lower-income families, living there exposes their children to an international diversity that they might not find elsewhere, and the borough still attracts other New Yorkers and out-of-towners.\n\n\"I like them to see the variety of what's in New York and have interactions with different kinds of people,\" Ms. Lustig said. \"If we lived in the suburbs, I don't think my daughter would know much about the Trinidadian way of life or the Muslim holidays that are celebrated. She accepts that like it's water or air.\"\n\nChris and Marcia Osborne live on the Upper West Side with their two children, ages 4 and 6. He grew up in Manhattan and marvels at how much safer the neighborhood is now. She is a marketing director for a credit card company.\n\n\"I grew up in the Washington suburbs, and I feel even more firmly about staying in the city,\" said Ms. Osborne, 37. \"What keeps me in the city is desirable more than it is affordable.\"\n\nMr. Osborne, 44, an expert on the Russian economy for a firm of financial advisors said: \"If both parents are working, it actually becomes logistically difficult to live in the suburbs. If you're 90 minutes away, we just don't like that feeling.\n\n\"Even if we were disposed to  for the usual space, quality of life reasons  to go to suburbs, we would have to consider the practical difficulty.\"\n\nThe cost of private school often becomes pivotal. \"Even though philosophically and politically I believe all public education should be of equal quality and wish that my kids could go to the public school,\" he said, \"I would challenge anyone to look at the school and tell me that if they had a choice they would send their kids there.\n\n\"If we had a third,\" he said, \"it would become very difficult.\"\n\nWhile the number of children of all races between ages 5 to 9 in Manhattan has declined slightly since 2000, the number of white children of that age grew by nearly 40 percent.\n\nDavid Bernard, 42, and Joanna Bers, 38, run a management and marketing consulting business and live with their 17-month-old twin sons on Fifth Avenue. Both grew up in suburbia.\n\n\"I like the idea of raising them in the city because they're prepared for pretty much anything,\" Mr. Bernard said. \"The city challenges you; it prepares you for life.\"\n\nManhattan is probably more diverse than most suburbs, he said, because \"the five boroughs are brought together in Manhattan.\"\n\n\"We were just at the Children's Museum, and I didn't see a lack of diversity there at all,\" Ms. Bers said. \"New York is a melting pot. We have every intention of sending our kids to P.S. 6. New York is a wonderful place to raise children, especially if there are more of them and more resources devoted to them.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "End Affirmative Action for Rich White Students, Too\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nJohn McWhorter\n\nBy John McWhorter\n\nOpinion Writer\n\nMy newsletter last week about illiberalism on the political right led to claims, in the Twittersphere and elsewhere, that I was engaging in \"whataboutism\" or \"both-sides-ism,\" perhaps even seeking absolution from the woke left by pointing to examples of censorship on the right.\n\nI've often had a similar sense of whataboutism when it comes to the discussion of racial preferences in college admissions, the subject of my other newsletter last week. Often, calls to eliminate these racial preferences - as mine was - are met with objections asking, \"What about?\" universities that maintain preferences primarily benefiting white students, notably in the form of legacy admissions.\n\nUnder these, children of alumni get special consideration for admission. According to one report , in 2019, nearly half of colleges factored legacy into freshman admissions. This already dubious practice is compounded when universities cater to financial donors, often white, in admissions decisions.\n\nAnd its effect is no more a mere \"thumb on the scale\" than that of racial preferences. Consider Harvard: A 2019 paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that \"Over 43 percent of white admits are ALDC\" - athletes, legacies, \"dean's interest\" and children of faculty and staff - \"compared to less than 16 percent of admits for each of the other three major racial/ethnic groups\" and that around three-quarters of them would not have been admitted otherwise. And as The Times reported in 2018, a federal lawsuit revealed emails between Harvard's dean of admissions and university fund-raisers \"suggesting special consideration for the offspring of big donors, those who have 'already committed to a building' or have 'an art collection which could conceivably come our way.'\"\n\nLegacy preferences are, more or less, affirmative action for white kids.\n\nSo, my answer to the whataboutism of using legacy preferences as a defense of or at least a rebuttal to questioning race-based preferences is: Legacy preferences should go as well. Of course. Elite schools such as Amherst College and Johns Hopkins University have ended the practice. A 2020 statement from John Pérez, then the chair of the University of California Board of Regents, read, \"Per long-established U.C. Regents policy, U.C. forbids legacy admissions and does not grant preferential admission to the children of alumni or donors.\" A blunt stand-alone statement on the admissions website at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reads: \"M.I.T. doesn't consider legacy or alumni relations in our admissions process. If you'd like to read more about this policy, check out the blog Just to Be Clear: We Don't Do Legacy.\"\n\nThese schools are on the right track. There should be neither preferences for well-to-do white students nor preferences for well-off students of color - even those we might describe as merely upper middle class, such as my own children - but instead, preferences for students of poor or working-class backgrounds, irrespective of race.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

But he lamented the idea that Congress could not be expected to make its own decisions, free of corporate influence.\n\n\"So all lawmakers can really do is just chastise Facebook publicly and ask them nicely to go and think about what they've done.

And Pruitt had 'round-the-clock security,' costing nearly $3 million. One former co-worker said, 'He wanted to be treated like he was the president.'

      "text": "Mike White's Mischievous Vision for \"The White Lotus\"\n\nMike White's first job as a television writer, in the late nineties, was on the teen soap opera \" Dawson's Creek .\" It was a sentimental show, leavened by sharp, self-conscious dialogue; the titular character, Dawson Leery, was a film buff who worked at a video store, which meant that he could analyze the show's various narrative devices at least as well as viewers could. One of White's main tasks was to prolong the sense of romantic anticipation that sustained the show, and for a time he enjoyed solving this puzzle. But it didn't last. \"I quickly couldn't keep interested,\" he said recently. \"I always, whether intentionally or not, started burning down the house.\"\n\nIt was a sticky spring afternoon in Phuket, Thailand, and White had summoned a few dozen actors and a few hundred crew members from around the world to shoot the third season of \"The White Lotus,\" his acclaimed HBO series. The show, which began as a rushed pandemic project in Hawaii, has expanded into a globe-trotting franchise, with a new setting and array of characters for each incarnation. \"This is, like, my dream gig,\" White said. \"Because I can burn down the house at the end of every season and start building again.\"\n\nThe 100th Anniversary Issue Subscribers get full access. Read the issue »\n\nWhite is fifty-four, with pale skin, pale hair, and a nasal, hesitating voice that disguises an implacable determination to do things precisely the way he wants. For most of his career, he was known for what he calls \"oddball character studies\"-projects that were cerebral and a little weird. He wrote and starred in \"Chuck & Buck,\" an indie movie that drew a small crowd but left a big impression: Entertainment Weekly named it the year's best film, and Roger Ebert called it \"a fascinating study of behavior that violates the rules,\" although his reviewing partner, Richard Roeper, likened the film to \"spiders crawling on my arms.\" White found broad success when he wrote \"School of Rock,\" the Jack Black movie, which inspired a children's television show and a Broadway musical. His first HBO drama, \"Enlightened,\" delighted a narrower audience . In the show, Laura Dern played Amy Jellicoe, who was an inspiring crusader and a painful nightmare, sometimes in the same scene. It ran for two seasons before it was cancelled.\n\nWhite specializes in characters who leave viewers unsure of how to feel about them, or about themselves. With \"The White Lotus,\" though, he has found a way to provide plenty of pleasure along with the pain. The show is both a social satire and a murder mystery, named for the fictional luxury hotel chain where it is set. People go to the White Lotus to be pampered, which means that the audience can feel pampered, too, watching glamorous characters talking through various trivial and existential crises. Each season begins with an unidentified corpse, giving viewers assurance that, by season's end, a question will be settled, even if their feelings about the characters aren't.\n\nThe first season, filmed at a Four Seasons in Maui and broadcast in 2021, was a barbed morality play about the ways that rich Americans make themselves at home in exotic locations. Unlike many pandemic-era projects, it felt bright and buoyant, earning an armful of awards and becoming HBO's most streamed show. White followed up by discarding much of what fans loved. The second season, which he describes as \"an Italian bedroom farce,\" was set in Sicily, and its characters and plot were more exuberant: if Hawaii gave White a chance to skewer American hypocrisy, Sicily gave him a chance to escape it. Now, for the third season, he was again asking fans to transfer their loyalty to an almost entirely new show.\n\nThough White finds these constant transformations enlivening, they put pressure on him: because the cast and the location and even the theme song keep changing, the show's identity is its semi-satirical tone-that is, White's tone. The new season begins with violent chaos; viewers expecting a comedy of manners get something that looks, instead, like an action movie. \"It's about death,\" White told me. \"But I also find it maybe the funniest season.\" The plot came to him on a location-scouting trip, when he was struck with bronchitis and given a steroid nebulizer; kept awake by the medicine, he found himself imagining a group of Westerners who descend on Thailand in search of spiritual revival.\n\nLink copied\n\nWe were sitting in an air-conditioned hotel suite with a dramatic view of Patong Bay, where a cruise ship was slowly turning, on its way from Perth to Mumbai. White seemed too distracted to notice. By creating a hit series about luxury hotels, he has consigned himself to a life of upscale travel, and he had been in Thailand, off and on, for more than a year. He said that the whole process made him feel a bit like a con man: he had dreamed up a story, and now he had to bring it profitably to life. \"I see myself as an indie weirdo who's just backed into this,\" he said. \"I'm white-knuckling my way through.\" Then he began to cry softly, which made him chuckle at his own sentimentality. (In a Mike White show, the sight of a director crying in front of a journalist would surely be presented as awkward comedy.) He said that he found it exhausting to be responsible for so many people-all those actors who had uprooted their lives and moved to Thailand-and that he wasn't used to the pressure of commercial expectations. Yet people who know him say that he has always believed in his own ability to tell a great story. \"Obviously, I don't want to lay an egg,\" he told me. \"But I don't think I'm going to.\"\n\nAs an actor, White has often portrayed nebbishes and sneaks, so people who meet him are sometimes surprised to encounter a fit, energetic man with a fondness for protein shakes. In Thailand, he was wearing gray running shorts and On Cloud sneakers, as well as a wristband that kept track of his heart-rate variability and sleep regimen. He told me that he wanted to make sure he was at his best during the long, hot shoot, though he conceded that this was also an act of benevolent manipulation: he wanted the cast and crew to function at their best, too. \"He's always asking me how many grams of protein I ate, or what's my H.R.V.,\" Patrick Schwarzenegger, one of the stars of the new season, said during a break between scenes. Schwarzenegger is the son of the legendary action star, and also a fitness obsessive: he co-founded a company that makes protein bars. He said he had grown used to encountering White in the hotel gym at five in the morning.\n\nBecause White is an exacting and perceptive person, he knows how infuriating exacting people can be. In the first season, Jake Lacy and Alexandra Daddario played a honeymooning couple: Shane, a rich heir, and Rachel, a frustrated journalist who is increasingly uncertain that she has, in fact, married well. Shane spends most of the six episodes engaged in a spiralling dispute with the hotel's disobliging manager over whether he has been given the suite he requested:\n\nR ACHEL : Why wouldn't he want us to have the room? Why would he care?\n\nS HANE : I bet because he thinks I'm an asshole.\n\nR ACHEL : Well, were you an asshole?\n\nS HANE : No! No, I was actually trying to not be an asshole.\n\nR ACHEL ( with a bright smile ): But-you failed?\n\nThe undisputed fan favorite from that season was Jennifer Coolidge , who played a wealthy, woozy solo traveller named Tanya; she never seemed quite sure where she was or how she had got there. The role marked a career resurgence for Coolidge, and she was virtually the only actor who returned for Season 2. But she didn't make the trip to Thailand. \"I miss her a lot,\" White said, without seeming to doubt his decision. Later, when I talked to Coolidge, she said, graciously, that she understood that her departure was a dramatic necessity: \"I don't think Tanya's ever coming back, so I have to live with it.\"\n\nThis year's cast includes Parker Posey , playing an ostentatious matriarch with a toothsome Southern drawl. One afternoon during shooting, she was sitting at a table in the hotel restaurant, wearing a peach-colored cotton dress, swatting at the air, and singing a quiet song of her own invention: \"Bug spray, bug spray, bug spra-a-a-ay.\" White approached her to confer, and they traded requests: she asked him to scratch a spot on her back, and he asked her to angle slightly toward the camera. The scene also involved her character's daughter, played with eye-rolling disdain by Sarah Catherine Hook, and the daughter's father, who was evidently in some kind of trouble. Posey's character wanted her daughter to understand that the dad, played by Jason Isaacs, really wasn't so bad. He had his flaws, but he wasn't some sort of lowlife or sexual predator. \"You think men like that only exist in bad movies,\" Posey said. \"Turns out? They're real.\" White ducked in with a suggestion: perhaps Posey could say \"They're real\" with rising intonation, as a verbal shrug?\n\nWhite thinks of himself primarily as a writer, which means that he can't help being attuned to the minutiae of the script. But actors he has worked with say that they think of him as a fellow-practitioner. At one point, he told Isaacs, \"Hide it better.\" He wanted Isaacs to carry on a normal conversation, trusting that the camera would find his eyes and allow him to show, with a minimal gesture, that something was terribly wrong. Isaacs said that he had learned to trust White. \"He wants to shriek with laughter-sometimes at the most tragic things,\" he said. \"If you get a shriek from behind the monitor, you know two things. One, you've done something great. And, two, you might have to do it again, because he's ruined the sound.\"\n\nWhite's father, Mel, says that Mike was an unusually confident and clear-eyed boy. \"Michael has never been ambivalent about anything,\" he told me. When Mel tried to scold him, Mike would patiently pull him aside and say, \"Dad, take it easy.\" The family lived in Pasadena, and White got interested in theatre in the second grade, thanks to a teacher who happened to be Sam Shepard's mother. His own mother, Lyla, later worked as the executive director of the Pasadena Playhouse.\n\nWhite is a second-generation writer and director, but he could not fairly be described as a nepo baby. Mel White was for a time a leading storyteller in the evangelical movement. Starting in the early nineteen-seventies, he wrote a series of inspirational tracts, and then ghostwrote books for some of the movement's most prominent figures, including Pat Robertson (\"America's Dates with Destiny\") and Jerry Falwell (\"Strength for the Journey\"). He also helped direct documentaries for Francis Schaeffer, the influential theologian. Mike attended an exclusive day school in Pasadena, and on Sundays he went to a Congregationalist church to hear his father preach against materialism, sometimes arguing that Christians shouldn't even own homes. In the summer, he was sent to a Christian camp that held rapture drills. \"I felt like an outsider, but I didn't dress the part of a countercultural person,\" he said. \"It took a while to figure out what, exactly, I was counter to.\"\n\nDuring those years, Mel was struggling to quench his lifelong attraction to men. When Mike was around eleven, he stumbled on one of his father's journals and began to discover that his parents' marriage was more complicated than he had suspected. \"It was definitely a house of secrets,\" he remembers. In 1993, Mel publicly announced that he was gay, and the next year he published \" Stranger at the Gate: To Be Gay and Christian in America ,\" an affecting memoir that described his efforts to change, including electroconvulsive therapy; his decision to stop trying to change; and his disappointment that his former friends and allies, especially Robertson and Falwell, weren't willing to reconsider their beliefs about same-sex romance, or even talk with him about his life. On \"60 Minutes,\" Mel tried to explain why he had waited to publicly criticize people he so disagreed with. \"I was blinded by my love for Jesus, and my love for the Scripture, and my hopes for the Church,\" he said. \"And I was-yeah, I had two kids in college.\"\n\nWhite's older sister, Erinn, attended Azusa Pacific, and is now a teacher. White went to Wesleyan, where he became known as a writer of sharp dialogue. One of his T.A.s, Zak Penn, remembers a scene that he wrote depicting two women getting drunk in a bar. \"I was astonished that he had written something that well observed,\" Penn says: the women sounded like real people, talking about real lives.\n\nNot long afterward, Penn moved to Hollywood, and landed a hundred-and-sixty-thousand-dollar writing deal. (He had co-written the script that became \"Last Action Hero,\" starring Patrick Schwarzenegger's father.) He offered half the fee to White after he graduated. White was a hard worker, though not by nature a team player. Penn recalls, \"I said, 'I'll do the first fifteen pages, and you do the next fifteen.' That was a Friday, and on Monday he came in with forty pages written-all great.\"\n\nWhen a fellow Wesleyan graduate, Miguel Arteta, gave White and Penn small roles in an indie film he was making, \"Star Maps,\" White couldn't resist rewriting their few lines of dialogue. The two played smug screenwriters, and White thought that his character should respond to a director's suggestion about making a sex scene more political by saying, \"When they're fucking on her desk, she can knock over a recycling bin.\" Arteta wasn't offended-he was impressed. \"I was, like, 'Dear God, yes, please, let's shoot this,' \" he says.\n\nIt was the late nineties, and White was shopping some screenplays while taking TV-writing jobs. Arteta found himself preoccupied with one of White's scripts, \"Chuck & Buck,\" about a guy who can't let go of his boyhood best friend. Arteta asked White to let him direct, and White played Buck. In an era of twee indie films, Buck was defiantly uncharming-a \"lost, gay predator retard,\" as White once called him. Over the years, White has described himself as bisexual or gay, but he wanted to resist the neat logic of the coming-out story. \"My dad suffered a lot from wanting to appear good,\" he told me. \"It was so important for him to say, 'Gays are just like you, we're good little boys.' And 'Chuck & Buck' is me being, like, 'I don't want to be making that argument for my career, or my life. I'm not a good little boy.' \" White took his father to a screening, and remembers Mel grabbing his leg in feigned shock-or, perhaps, real shock-during some of the film's most uncomfortable moments, like Buck's desperate and manipulative pleas for sex. \"I thought, He's way ahead of me, in terms of dealing with issues you don't deal with publicly,\" Mel White told me. \"The first movie he made, and the star only wanted a blow job.\"\n\nOne of the film's fans was Jennifer Aniston , who agreed to play the lead in White and Arteta's next collaboration, \"The Good Girl,\" which starts out like a romantic comedy and then goes disastrously, absurdly wrong. Something similar happened to White's career a few years later, after he got an offer to create a sitcom for Fox. \"Cracking Up\" was about a young psychology student who moves into the guesthouse of a wealthy Beverly Hills family. As the tagline put it, \"Meet the all-American family-and the therapist crazy enough to live with them!\"\n\nFox had ambitious goals for the show-which was broadcast immediately after \"American Idol\"-and apparently that was part of the problem. Molly Shannon played the mother, who suffered from a frantic addiction to pills and alcohol. She says that the set was great fun until the network started thinking that viewers might prefer a show that was less unhinged. Shannon remembers a disagreement with executives over a scene in which her character tried to bust open a safe containing the family's alcohol supply. \"It was such brilliant writing, and just a joy-but then they started giving these notes that were not good,\" she says. \"And, really, Mike was getting stressed out.\"\n\nAs a writer, White could appreciate the irony: under the pressure of trying to manage a show called \"Cracking Up,\" he was cracking up. He wrote a letter to Fox, insulting the executives and all but daring them to cancel. Eventually, he found himself so paralyzed by stress that he thought he might be having a nervous breakdown, and briefly visited Las Encinas, a Pasadena psychiatric hospital. In the end, he turned to Buddhist self-help books, even as he cringed at the idea of a burned-out Hollywood writer doing self-actualization exercises. \"You see it as the absurdity that it is,\" he said. \"But then, the next minute, you're kind of still drinking the Kool-Aid.\"\n\nOne of White's favorite tactics is to give a character a speech that's both serious and funny-not wholly convincing but not wholly inane. For a time, in the early nineties, he lived next door to Jack Black , and he wrote \"School of Rock\" with him in mind. (More than once, White has surprised a prospective collaborator with a script that no one knew he was working on.) Black, who was then establishing himself as a good-natured but anarchic film star, was amazed at how well the screenplay captured his vibe. \"That's my tombstone role, for sure,\" he told me.\n\nEarly in the movie, Black's character, Dewey, a hapless rocker who fakes his way into a gig as a substitute teacher, tells a roomful of students that the world is rigged against them:\n\nThe Man ruined the ozone, and he's burning down the Amazon, and he kidnapped Shamu and put her in a chlorine tank, O.K.? And there used to be a way to stick it to the Man: it was called rock and roll. But guess what? Oh, no, the Man ruined that, too, with a little thing called MTV. So don't waste your time trying to make anything cool, or pure, or awesome, 'cause the Man's just gonna call you a fat, washed-up loser and crush your soul. So do yourselves a favor and just give up!\n\nBlack's bug-eyed charisma makes this pathetic sermon seem halfway convincing, and gives viewers a moment to calibrate their opinion of Dewey. (Would you entrust your child to this man?) \"School of Rock\" is basically a wholesome family film, but it delivers a complicated message: even a flawed doctrine can be compelling, and transformative. This, perhaps, is a lesson that White learned as a boy, sitting next to the pulpit when his father was preaching. And perhaps he learned it again at Wesleyan, where he wrote a thesis on Judith Butler and earnestly studied the scriptures of postmodern theory. \"Wesleyan was, like, the P.C. school, before institutions all became sort of like that, and I embraced the theology of that for a long time,\" he says. (The atmosphere there was intense enough to inspire the 1994 satire \"PCU,\" co-written by Zak Penn.)\n\nAttentive followers of White's career may find themselves anticipating the loopy gospels that his characters preach-and then, inevitably, fail to entirely practice. In \"Enlightened,\" the main character, Amy, is emerging from a breakdown and trying to put her newfound wisdom to use. The show opens with our hero sobbing in a bathroom stall. \"You look insane,\" a co-worker tells her, and the subsequent episodes complicate this judgment without quite refuting it. By the end of the second season, Amy is a crusader against corporate corruption-but also, still, an annoying and bottomlessly needy presence, as so many of us are, at least some of the time.\n\nAfter her breakdown, Amy goes to a retreat in Hawaii, and a voice-over narrates the words we see her writing in her journal:\n\nI'm speaking with my true voice now, without bitterness or fear, and I'm here to tell you: you can walk out of hell and into the light, you can wake up to your higher self. And, when you do, the world is suddenly full of possibility, of wonder and deep connection.\n\nLike much of what Amy says in the course of two seasons, this is ludicrous without necessarily being wrong. Part of what White loved about the character was that she wasn't cool-she had little in common with Tony Soprano , Walter White , Don Draper , or other manly television rogues. White says that HBO executives worried about the \"emo voice-overs\" that bookended many of the episodes, and the \"tonal ambivalence\" that has long been one of his favorite qualities. At one point, Amy's ex-husband goes on the Hawaiian retreat that she loved. He hates it. \"It's like I'm in a Hawaiian prison,\" he says. The episode was broadcast in 2013, the year that White bought a house in Hawaii-having decided, apparently, that Amy's notion of finding renewal in the middle of the Pacific Ocean wasn't so ridiculous after all.\n\nEven by Hawaiian standards, Kauai is a low-key place: quieter than Oahu and less opulent than Maui. White lives across the street from the ocean, and he has set up editing bays in several units of a time-share development nearby, an arrangement that suits both his temperament and the show's budget. (The state government offers a twenty-seven-per-cent tax credit for certain film-production work undertaken on Kauai.) I visited White there in early December. A few friends were in town, and his flatulent bulldog, Peanut, was following him loyally wherever he went. He seemed to have recovered from the stress of the shoot, although now he was facing the stress of having to edit the footage into a show that met his standards. \"I'm so fried, bro,\" he said, strolling along the wide beach, with mountains framing a neon sunset. \"It's really nice to be somewhere like this, around all this natural beauty, and just chill.\"\n\nIn fact, White's time in Hawaii did not seem particularly chill. He said that his relationship with his long-term boyfriend had fallen apart because \"The White Lotus\" had taken over his schedule; his life was one long working vacation. And yet he was already thinking about scouting locations for the fourth season. \"I'm not in a relationship, I don't have kids,\" he said. \"I'd love to have a break, but two weeks in I'd be, like\"-he imagined himself sitting home, restless-\"what are we doing?\"\n\nNot all of White's projects have been manifestly personal. (He once spent a couple of weeks doctoring the script for \"The Emoji Movie.\") But, after the failure of \"Cracking Up,\" he fulfilled a promise to write something for Molly Shannon . The script became \"Year of the Dog,\" which was released in 2007, as White's directorial début. Shannon played Peggy, a lonely office worker who develops a passion for animal rights after the death of her dog, Pencil. In a different kind of film, Peggy might learn some lessons, find a boyfriend, and return to her office job, wiser and happier. Instead, a trapdoor seems to open in White's script, and Peggy falls through it. She commits financial fraud and attempts murder; offered an unlikely chance at redemption, she abandons her old life to devote herself to animal welfare. She explains her conversion, naturally, with a voice-over speech that is among the most cockeyed in the Mike White œuvre: \"How do I explain the things I've said and done? How do I explain the person I've become? I know I've disappointed everyone, and I'm sorry for that. I wish I was a more articulate person. I believe life is magical.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nBy the time White made the film, he was a vegan-he says that his opposition to animal cruelty is about as close as he comes to zealotry. Shannon and White are a reliably funny and off-kilter team (she also appears in \"Enlightened\" and \"The White Lotus\"), and not long ago she came to visit him in Hawaii. One day, while White was distracted with a phone call, Shannon tried to pet Peanut, who nipped her in the face. \"I have no hard feelings toward Peanut,\" Shannon told me. If anything, she seemed pleased to know that White had such a fierce protector.\n\nWhite says that, in some ways, the \"White Lotus\" character he most resembles is Quinn, the socially maladroit son from Season 1, who doesn't seem to care about anyone or anything until he joins a sea-canoeing crew of local men. Exalted, he decides not to go home.\n\nWhite now owns two houses on Kauai. Compared with the tourists, he is a local, but compared with the natives he is a wealthy interloper, not entirely different from the \"White Lotus\" characters he satirized. \"Unless I feel somehow personally indicted, it doesn't feel like I'm doing anything that bold,\" he told me. \"I have to take these people seriously enough that it isn't just a satire.\" One of Kauai's most famous part-time residents, Mark Zuckerberg, reportedly owns more than a thousand acres of beachfront property, including an underground bunker. But the difference between his compound and White's modest pair of houses is merely one of scale. \"I can make fun of Mark Zuckerberg-but I am also that person,\" White says.\n\nLast fall, HBO announced a global partnership with Four Seasons, the resort chain where the majority of all three seasons of \"The White Lotus\" were filmed. (The companies promise \"on-site activations at Four Seasons properties globally designed to engage audiences across multiple touchpoints.\") HBO sells \"White Lotus\" bathrobes, and Coffee-mate is celebrating the show's return with a \"White Lotus\"-branded nondairy creamer flavored like Thai iced coffee. One day, when I was having lunch with White, he got a text from his father, who still lives in California, proudly sharing the news that the show had made the front page of the Los Angeles Times . The headline read \" THAILAND GEARS UP FOR ROLE PAYOFF .\" The article reported that the country was expecting an influx of visitors thanks to the show.\n\nWhite recognizes that glamorous locales are essential to the reliable television formula that he describes as \"attractive people in beautiful places doing sexy, dirty shit.\" He was lured to Thailand not just by its narrative possibilities but also by tax incentives that the other main contender, Japan, was unable to match. Much of the season was filmed at a Four Seasons on Koh Samui, an island in the Gulf of Thailand, where a suite can cost as much as fifteen thousand dollars a night; some scenes were filmed at a secluded hillside hotel in Phuket. Footage of the two would be combined to create the fictional White Lotus Thailand.\n\nMost of the actors, like their characters, were visitors, but the cast also included a handful of renowned locals, none more renowned than Lalisa Manoban, the country's leading pop star, who is better known as Lisa, from the world-conquering K-pop group BLACKPINK . At first, White was wary of Manoban, even though she had a strong audition, not to mention a hundred and five million followers on Instagram. He didn't want to seem desperate for attention, and he wasn't sure he wanted to deal with the extra security that would be required. But he came to see that it might seem disrespectful, both to Manoban and to her country, not to cast her. When the news broke that she would have a part, some of the show's Thai staffers broke down in tears-and, White says, Thai officials became even more eager to help.\n\nWhite acknowledged that his desire to do right by Thailand sometimes conflicted with his lifelong desire to tell stories that are \"mischievous,\" as he puts it. \"There's moments where I'm, like, 'Do I want to show this side of Thailand?' \" he said. He was referring, perhaps, to the raffish culture down the hill in the Patong entertainment district, which is known for providing a more unpretentious vacation experience than the one typically depicted in the series: rowdy bars, late-night massage spas, Muay Thai fights. \"I feel this need to show the beauty, make people want to come here,\" White said.\n\nLast summer, when HBO released the first images from the new season, some viewers objected to the sepia tones: they thought it looked as if White had filmed Thailand with a so-called Mexico filter, an approach made infamous by the Steven Soderbergh movie \"Traffic,\" which contrasted yellow-tinted scenes set in Mexico with blue-tinted scenes set in the United States. (Critics felt that the yellow tint was a lazy way to evoke a world of heat, dirt, and disorder.) By December, when the first teaser was released, set to a song by the beloved Thai rock band Carabao, the images were noticeably less yellow.\n\nMany viewers have heard of the Bechdel test, named for the cartoonist Alison Bechdel, who in 1985 depicted a character saying that she would watch a movie only if it had at least two women in it who had a conversation about \"something besides a man.\" Watching the first season of \"The White Lotus,\" I found myself thinking about a different standard. I call it the pervert test. Whenever I see a nonwhite character onscreen, I find myself wondering, Could this character possibly be a pervert? Or at any rate a creep, a brute, a charlatan, a narcissist, a villain? Or will this character turn out to be drearily decent, possessed of no serious flaws except those which can be justified by the character's backstory or by the flaws of society?\n\nThe thought arose because \"The White Lotus\" is so full of transgression and bad behavior, especially when it comes to sex. In the first season, Steve Zahn plays Mark, who is thrown by the revelation that his late father was gay. His daughter, Olivia, played by Sydney Sweeney, torments him by cheerfully considering the precise arrangements. \"Even if he wasn't a top, it doesn't mean he was femme,\" she says. \"He could have still been butch, Dad.\" (Zahn's character does not find this consoling.) Armond, the hotel manager, played by the Australian actor Murray Bartlett, bears a resemblance to Basil Fawlty, the manic proprietor in \"Fawlty Towers,\" the old British sitcom. He is also a gay man who commits a spectacular act of sexual harassment, and an even more spectacular act of nonsexual harassment: in a frenzy of anger and desperation, he defecates in a guest's suitcase.\n\nUnderstandably, perhaps, White seems a bit more cautious when it comes to race. Natasha Rothwell, who plays the spa manager Belinda, is Black, and her character sometimes sounds like a spokesperson. \"The clientele here is mostly rich white people-and to be honest I struggle with that,\" she says in an early episode, as if expecting viewers to nod along. By the end of the season, though, these mostly rich white people have been complicated and, in some cases, vindicated. Olivia and her stringently progressive friend Paula, played by the biracial actor Brittany O'Grady, function as a kind of Greek chorus, offering deadpan observations of the world around them. But Paula turns out to be, if not precisely a pervert, then probably some kind of villain. \"I was, like, 'This is going to get me in trouble,' \" White said. \"But I felt like it was worth it.\" As it happened, there was not much trouble. Reviews were almost uniformly positive, and though one critic described Olivia's cracks about her grandfather's sexuality as \"disturbingly unfunny,\" it's not clear that White considers this a criticism.\n\nThe pervert test did not much apply to the second season, in which virtually everyone was white. That season was even more of a sensation than the first one, thanks in part to its debauched atmosphere. Two of the most memorable characters were high-spirited Sicilian sex workers. And White seemed to take particular pleasure in inverting his father's cosmology, as Tanya descended into a hellish subculture of what White describes as \"evil gays.\" The whooping theme song became an unlikely night-club hit, summoning a world of bad behavior.\n\nThe new season includes a hint of incest, or perhaps more than a hint, as well as a gay plotline that is, White promises, \"truly Satanic.\" He likes the idea of finding ways to depict gay life as transgressive, or even perverted-not, of course, to condemn it but to connect it to the rest of humanity, and the rest of human sexuality. \"It's not all harmless,\" he says. \"But it's not inherently harmful. It's inherently very natural. We're animals.\"\n\nWhite is intensely aware of how much the ethos of Hollywood has changed since the nineties, at least superficially. Back then, he says, the networks would quiz people like him about their female characters: \"Is she hot? Is she fuckable?\" Nowadays, he says, the same kinds of executives might ask, \"Do we have a person of color?\" His instinct has always been to resist these sorts of demands. In 2023, when the Writers Guild of America went on strike , one of its goals was to compel studios to increase the size of writers' rooms, which some people hoped would give more diverse writers a chance to learn the trade. White is unusual in that he works entirely alone, although he does solicit feedback on the finished scripts. \"I don't want a writers' room,\" he told me. \"I don't have time to mentor anybody, and I don't really want to be scrutinized that way.\" (In the end, the new deal retained an exception for writers who truly work alone.) White's approach means that he is often creating dialogue for characters who do not resemble him, in contravention of the idea that demographic authenticity is a necessary ingredient in a great script. But the opportunity to transgress boundaries of identity is one of his favorite parts of writing; many of his most celebrated characters, after all, are women. \"It's a pleasure to try to get inside someone's head,\" he says.\n\nFor this season, White brought back Belinda. On set in Thailand, I mentioned to Rothwell that many fans perceived Belinda as an oasis of decency, and I asked whether she ever wished that her character could be as indecent as some of the others. She told me that she had thought carefully about giving Belinda agency, and suggested that it might be possible to read her not as a spa manager with a heart of gold but as a strategic operator whose big idea-that Tanya will invest in her new business-suggests a certain degree of \"narcissism\" and \"hubris.\" When I relayed this interpretation to White, he sounded skeptical, but he did allow that Belinda might have a chance to make some mistakes of her own this season.\n\nWhen it comes to the depiction of Thai people, White seems to expect a fair amount of scrutiny. \"In Italy, all the Italian characters were running around fucking each other,\" he told me. \"If I had made the Thai characters all sex workers, it would have been a problem.\" Even one Thai sex worker might have been considered one too many, unless the portrayal was scrupulously high-minded. So he made sure that Manoban's character, a charming hotel employee named Mook, was someone that her fans could be proud of. \"She's not a pervert-she fails the pervert test,\" White said, almost apologetically. \"But she's a hustler. She's pushy.\"\n\nDespite his early exposure to Sam Shepard, White doesn't think of himself as particularly highbrow. \"I'm not really a Criterion guy,\" he says. One of his abiding passions is reality television, particularly shows in which competitors are made to suffer under pressure. In 2009, he appeared, with his father, on \"The Amazing Race,\" which sends pairs of contestants on around-the-world scavenger hunts. The Whites were portrayed as something of an oddity: a gay father-and-son duo, unusually kind to each other and to fellow-contestants. Mel, who was seventy, was the oldest person on the show, but far from the weakest. \"I think the other teams might think my dad is Cloris Leachman, but he's really MacGyver,\" Mike said, in the opening episode. After a series of mishaps, they were ejected in Phuket, and spent weeks in a house with other discarded contestants; the new season of \"The White Lotus\" is, in a way, White's chance for redemption.\n\nWhite is also a fan of \"Survivor,\" the gruelling elimination show. It is probably not a coincidence that \"Survivor\" and \"The White Lotus\" share a structural resemblance: a bunch of big-and often annoying-personalities convene in an exotic location, and audiences try to guess who is going to be eliminated. Over the years, White became friendly with the host of \"Survivor,\" Jeff Probst, and convinced him that he would make a great contestant. In 2018, White appeared on the show's thirty-seventh season, in Fiji, which matched overachieving \"Goliaths\" against underdog \"Davids.\" White was sorted into the Goliath tribe, and came close to winning the show's million-dollar prize by slipping into character as a more or less regular guy, unthreatening enough to evade attention. Probst told me, \"There were a couple of people who said, 'Is he a David or a Goliath?' I said, 'Are you kidding? Good luck winning an argument with Mike White.' \"\n\nLink copied\n\nOne reason viewers are drawn to reality television is that the rules governing identity and behavior aren't so strict: given sufficient time and duress, just about everyone will pass the pervert test. On \"Survivor,\" White had a frosty relationship with Natalie Cole, a self-possessed Black woman from Los Angeles who was sorted into the Goliath tribe, by virtue of her career as a newspaper and magazine publisher. By the third episode, White was complaining that Cole was \"an unpleasant drain around camp,\" and some of his fellow-Goliaths seemed to agree. If this had been a scripted series, Cole would have been given a chance to show that she wasn't so unpleasant, and White would have had a moment to confront his own assumptions, and possibly his own racism. But on \"Survivor\" this conflict went unresolved, especially since Cole was voted out in the fifth episode.\n\nNot long ago, though, she got an unexpected message from White, who wanted to know if she'd like to fly to Thailand for a small role in \"The White Lotus.\" He said that he respected her as a person and a competitor, and he liked the idea of affirming the connection between the two franchises. (\"Survivor\" contestants appeared in the first two seasons.) Cole agreed. \"We were kind of in conflict a lot,\" she recalled, in Phuket. Still, she suggested that White's scrupulous attention to behavior and body language helped explain both his success on \"Survivor\"and his success in Hollywood. \"It is personal, but, at the end of the day, it's a game,\" she said.\n\nTwelve years ago, when \"Enlightened\" was on the verge of being cancelled, White sat for an interview with Marc Maron , the comedian and podcaster. White sounded as if \"Enlightened\" was his one big shot, and he was bracing for it to be taken away. \"I had the Cinderella experience of the show,\" he said, noting that its ratings were unspectacular, with fewer than a million viewers a week. \"At some point, I'm going to come back to reality.\"\n\nNowadays, ratings are more mysterious, because streaming networks don't share data in a uniform or transparent way. (HBO said that the Season 2 finale of \"The White Lotus\" attracted more than four million viewers, although most of that number reflects people who watched some or all of the episode online.) Expectations of longevity have changed, too: many viewers no longer assume that a show will last more than a few seasons.\n\nIn this climate, the popularity of \"The White Lotus\" seems like something of a throwback to the age of prestige television. White has noticed that his friends are finding it harder to sell their TV and film ideas-in fact, \"The White Lotus\" was partly inspired by \"The Tears of St. Patsy,\" a proposed series starring Jennifer Coolidge as a frustrated actor navigating a dangerous world. When White shopped it to networks, no one was interested. (\"Everybody passed,\" he told the crowd at the Golden Globes, when he accepted an award for \"The White Lotus\" in 2023. Peering around the room, he added, \"I know you all passed.\") White still seems amazed that his little pandemic idea has turned into the biggest hit of his life. \"Somehow, I got on the last helicopter out of the dystopia that is Hollywood,\" he says.\n\nHe was sitting in one of the makeshift editing suites in Kauai: staffers had pushed aside a bed to install four monitors and two big speakers on tripods. A ceiling fan whirred, Peanut snored, and White calculated how much time he had to make small changes. \"HBO's not expecting it till Friday of next week, so there's no rush,\" he told one of the editors. This was Episode 6, of eight, and it was a little long. \"Sixty-three twenty-nine-ugh,\" White said. \"Are you trying to get me in trouble?\" Anything longer than an hour was likely to inspire suggestions from HBO, and White was not feeling particularly suggestible. He finds the editing process satisfying in a way that directing cannot be, because it yields something tangible: a finished episode, to justify the money he's getting from the network. On set, he is obliged to be enthusiastic, so that the actors don't get discouraged, but in the editing bay he is unsparing. \"It's a lot of eye acting going on,\" White said, disapprovingly, when he thought some facial gestures were unnecessarily big.\n\nAt least in its first two episodes, the new season is less fizzy than its predecessors, and more hardboiled: a show that once revolved around acerbic conversation now seems to be building toward a dénouement that involves at least one monk and at least one handgun. White's most important task is to locate that familiar mix of flavors-a kind of gin-and-tonic astringency-in every scene. At one point, he asked to reëdit a seemingly minor exchange that sounded too earnest. \"The sincerity of it is making me laugh,\" he said.\n\nIn some ways, the imperative of reinventing \"The White Lotus\" is an advantage: the cast changes, White says, actually help with morale: \"You're more in the dating stage. As opposed to 'I expected more out of my life and my marriage than this!' \"\n\nEven now, White thinks of \"The White Lotus\" as a bit of a fluke, and he knows there is no guarantee that people who loved the silly second season will also love the decidedly less silly third one. \"It isn't exactly a crowd-pleaser,\" he said. \"I don't know what it is, but we'll see.\" As far as he can tell, \"The White Lotus\" makes more sense in 2025 than it did in 2021, when the prevailing mood was a bit gentler and more earnest. \"I think the sensibilities of the culture have changed,\" he says. \"I think people want a little blood in the mouth.\" He is aware, though, that a brainy storyteller with a rather perverse sensibility is unlikely to remain at the center of mainstream culture indefinitely. \"I'm fifty-four years old,\" he told me. \"I feel like I've been out in the ocean, waiting for a wave. It's getting to sunset-maybe I'll just swim in. And then I catch a wave? I'm definitely going to ride this wave.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "White Like Me\n\nIn 1982, an investment banker named Richard Grand-Jean took a summer's lease on an eighteenth-century farmhouse in Fairfield, Connecticut; its owner, Anatole Broyard, spent his summers in Martha's Vineyard. The house was handsomely furnished with period antiques, and the surrounding acreage included a swimming pool and a pond. But the property had another attraction, too. Grand-Jean, a managing director of Salomon Brothers, was an avid reader, and he took satisfaction in renting from so illustrious a figure. Anatole Broyard had by then been a daily book reviewer for the Times for more than a decade, and that meant that he was one of literary America's foremost gatekeepers. Grand-Jean might turn to the business pages of the Times first, out of professional obligation, but he turned to the book page next, out of a sense of self. In his Walter Mittyish moments, he sometimes imagined what it might be like to be someone who read and wrote about books for a living-someone to whom millions of readers looked for guidance.\n\nBroyard's columns were suffused with both worldliness and high culture. Wry, mandarin, even self-amused at times, he wrote like a man about town, but one who just happened to have all of Western literature at his fingertips. Always, he radiated an air of soigné self-confidence: he could be amiable in his opinions or waspish, but he never betrayed a flicker of doubt about what he thought. This was a man who knew that his judgment would never falter and his sentences never fail him.\n\nGrand-Jean knew little about Broyard's earlier career, but as he rummaged through Broyard's bookshelves he came across old copies of intellectual journals like Partisan Review and Commentary , to which Broyard had contributed a few pieces in the late forties and early fifties. One day, Grand-Jean found himself leafing through a magazine that contained an early article by Broyard. What caught his eye, though, was the contributor's note for the article-or, rather, its absence. It had been neatly cut out, as if with a razor.\n\nA few years later, Grand-Jean happened on another copy of that magazine, and decided to look up the Broyard article again. This time, the note on the contributor was intact. It offered a few humdrum details-that Broyard was born in New Orleans, attended Brooklyn College and the New School for Social Research, and taught at New York University's Division of General Education. It also offered a less humdrum one: the situation of the American Negro, the note asserted, was a subject that the author \"knows at first hand.\" It was an elliptical formulation, to be sure, but for Anatole Broyard it may not have been elliptical enough.\n\nBroyard was born black and became white, and his story is compounded of equal parts pragmatism and principle. He knew that the world was filled with such snippets and scraps of paper, all conspiring to reduce him to an identity that other people had invented and he had no say in. Broyard responded with X-Acto knives and evasions, with distance and denials and half denials and cunning half-truths. Over the years, he became a virtuoso of ambiguity and equivocation. Some of his acquaintances knew the truth; many more had heard rumors about \"distant\" black ancestry (wasn't there a grandfather who was black? a great-grandfather?). But most were entirely unaware, and that was as he preferred it. He kept the truth even from his own children. Society had decreed race to be a matter of natural law, but he wanted race to be an elective affinity, and it was never going to be a fair fight. A penalty was exacted. He shed a past and an identity to become a writer-a writer who wrote endlessly about the act of shedding a past and an identity.\n\nAnatole Paul Broyard was born on July 16, 1920, in New Orleans to Paul Broyard and Edna Miller. His father was a carpenter and worked as a builder, along with his brothers; neither parent had graduated from elementary school. Anatole spent his early years in a modest house on St. Ann Street, in a colored neighborhood in the French Quarter. Documents in the Louisiana state archives show all Anatole's ancestors, on both sides, to have been Negroes, at least since the late eighteenth century. The rumor about a distant black ancestor was, in a sense, the reverse of the truth: he may have had one distant white ancestor. Of course, the conventions of color stratification within black America-nowhere more pronounced than in New Orleans-meant that light-skinned blacks often intermarried with other light-skinned blacks, and this was the case with Paul and his \"high yellow\" wife, Edna. Anatole was the second of three children; he and his sister Lorraine, two years older, were light-skinned, while Shirley, two years younger, was not so light-skinned. (The inheritance of melanin is an uneven business.) In any event, the family was identified as Negro, and identified itself as Negro. It was not the most interesting thing about them. But in America it was not a negligible social fact. The year before Anatole's birth, for example, close to a hundred blacks were lynched in the South and anti-black race riots claimed the lives of hundreds more.\n\nWhile Anatole was still a child, the family moved to the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, thus joining the great migration that took hundreds of thousands of Southern blacks to Northern cities during the twenties. In the French Quarter, Paul Broyard had been a legendary dancer, beau, and galant ; in the French Quarter, the Broyards-Paul was one of ten siblings-were known for their craftsmanship. Brooklyn was a less welcoming environment. \"He should never have left New Orleans, but my mother nagged him into it,\" Broyard recalled years later. Though Paul Broyard arrived there a master carpenter, he soon discovered that the carpenters' union was not favorably inclined toward colored applicants. A stranger in a strange city, Paul decided to pass as white in order to join the union and get work. It was strictly a professional decision, which affected his work and nothing else.\n\nFor Paul, being colored was a banal fact of life, which might be disguised when convenient; it was not a creed or something to take pride in. Paul did take pride in his craft, and he liked to boast of rescuing projects from know-nothing architects. He filled his home with furniture he had made himself-flawlessly professional, if a little too sturdily built to be stylish. He also took pride in his long legs and his dance-hall agility (an agility Anatole would share). It was a challenge to be a Brooklyn galant , but he did his best.\n\n\"Family life was very congenial, it was nice and warm and cozy, but we just didn't have any sort of cultural or intellectual nourishment at home,\" Shirley, who was the only member of the family to graduate from college, recalls. \"My parents had no idea even what the New York Times was, let alone being able to imagine that Anatole might write for it.\" She says, \"Anatole was different from the beginning.\" There was a sense, early on, that Anatole Broyard-or Buddy, as he was called then-was not entirely comfortable being a Broyard.\n\nShirley has a photograph, taken when Anatole was around four or five, of a family visit back to New Orleans. In it you can see Edna and her two daughters, and you can make out Anatole, down the street, facing in the opposite direction. The configuration was, Shirley says, pretty representative. After graduating from Boys High School, in the late thirties, he enrolled in Brooklyn College. Already, he had a passion for modern culture-for European cinema and European literature. The idea that meaning could operate on several levels seemed to appeal to him. Shirley recalls exasperating conversations along those lines: \"He'd ask me about a Kafka story I'd read or a French film I'd seen and say, 'Well, you see that on more than one level, don't you?' I felt like saying 'Oh, get off it.' Brothers don't say that to their sisters.\"\n\nJust after the war began, he got married, to a black Puerto Rican woman, Aida, and they soon had a daughter. (He named her Gala, after Salvador Dali's wife.) Shirley recalls, \"He got married and had a child on purpose-the purpose being to stay out of the Army. Then Anatole goes in the Army anyway, in spite of this child.\" And his wife and child moved in with the Broyard family.\n\nThough his military records were apparently destroyed in a fire, some people who knew him at this time say that he entered the segregated Army as a white man. If so, he must have relished the irony that after attending officers' training school he was made the captain of an all-black stevedore battalion. Even then, his thoughts were not far from the new life he envisioned for himself. He said that he joined the Army with a copy of Wallace Stevens in his back pocket; now he was sending money home to his wife and asking her to save it so that he could open a bookstore in the Village when he got back. \"She had other ideas,\" Shirley notes. \"She wanted him to get a nice job, nine to five.\"\n\nBetween Aida and the allure of a literary life there was not much competition. Soon after his discharge from the Army, at war's end, he found an apartment in the Village, and he took advantage of the G.I. Bill to attend evening classes at the New School for Social Research, on Twelfth Street. His new life had no room for Aida and Gala. (Aida, with the child, later moved to California and remarried.) He left other things behind, too. The black scholar and dramatist W. F. Lucas, who knew Buddy Broyard from Bed-Stuy, says, \"He was black when he got into the subway in Brooklyn, but as soon as he got out at West Fourth Street he became white.\"\n\nHe told his sister Lorraine that he had resolved to pass so that he could be a writer, rather than a Negro writer. His darker-skinned younger sister, Shirley, represented a possible snag, of course, but then he and Shirley had never been particularly close, and anyway she was busy with her own life and her own friends. (Shirley graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Hunter College, and went on to marry Franklin Williams, who helped organize the Peace Corps and served as Ambassador to Ghana.) They had drifted apart: it was just a matter of drifting farther apart. Besides, wasn't that why everybody came to New York-to run away from the confines of family, from places where people thought they knew who and what you were? Whose family wasn't in some way unsuitable? In a Times column in 1979 Broyard wrote, \"My mother and father were too folksy for me, too colorful. . . . Eventually, I ran away to Greenwich Village, where no one had been born of a mother and father, where the people I met had sprung from their own brows, or from the pages of a bad novel. . . . Orphans of the avant-garde, we outdistanced our history and our humanity.\" Like so much of what he wrote in this vein, it meant more than it said; like the modernist culture he loved, it had levels.\n\nIn the Village, where Broyard started a bookstore on Cornelia Street, the salient thing about him wasn't that he was black but that he was beautiful, charming, and erudite. In those days, the Village was crowded with ambitious and talented young writers and artists, and Broyard-known for calling men \"Sport\" and girls \"Slim\"-was never more at home. He could hang out at the San Remo bar with Dwight Macdonald and Delmore Schwartz, and with a younger set who yearned to be the next Macdonalds and the next Schwartzes. Vincent Livelli, a friend of Broyard's since Brooklyn College days, recalls, \"Everybody was so brilliant around us-we kept duelling with each other. But he was the guy that set the pace in the Village.\" His conversation sparkled-everybody said so. The sentences came out perfectly formed, festooned with the most apposite literary allusions. His high-beam charm could inspire worship but also resentment. Livelli says, \"Anatole had a sort of dancing attitude toward life-he'd dance away from you. He had people understand that he was brilliant and therefore you couldn't hold him if you weren't worthy of his attention.\"\n\nThe novelist and editor Gordon Lish says, \"Photographs don't suggest in any wise the enormous power he had in person. No part of him was ever for a moment at rest.\" He adds, \"I adored him as a man. I mean, he was really in a league with Neal Cassady as a kind of presence.\" But there was, he says, a fundamental difference between Broyard and Kerouac's inspiration and muse: \"Unlike Cassady, who was out of control, Anatole was exorbitantly in control. He was fastidious about managing things.\"\n\nExcept, perhaps, the sorts of things you're supposed to manage. His bookstore provided him with entrée to Village intellectuals-and them with entrée to Anatole-yet it was not run as a business, exactly. Its offerings were few but choice: Céline, Kafka, other hard-to-find translations. The critic Richard Gilman, who was one of its patrons, recalls that Broyard had a hard time parting with the inventory: \"He had these books on the shelf, and someone would want to buy one, and he would snatch it back.\"\n\nAround 1948, Broyard started to attract notice not merely for his charm, his looks, and his conversation but for his published writings. The early pieces, as often as not, were about a subject to which he had privileged access: blacks and black culture. Commentary , in his third appearance in its pages, dubbed him an \"anatomist of the Negro personality in a white world.\" But was he merely an anthropologist or was he a native informant? It wasn't an ambiguity that he was in any hurry to resolve. Still, if all criticism is a form of autobiography (as Oscar Wilde would have it), one might look to these pieces for clues to his preoccupations at the time. In a 1950 Commentary article entitled \"Portrait of the Inauthentic Negro,\" he wrote that the Negro's embarrassment over blackness should be banished by the realization that \"thousands of Negroes with 'typical' features are accepted as whites merely because of light complexion.\" He continued:\n\nThe inauthentic Negro is not only estranged from whites-he is also estranged from his own group and from himself. Since his companions are a mirror in which he sees himself as ugly, he must reject them; and since his own self is mainly a tension between an accusation and a denial, he can hardly find it, much less live in it. . . . He is adrift without a role in a world predicated on roles.\n\nA year later, in \"Keep Cool, Man: The Negro Rejection of Jazz,\" he wrote, just as despairingly, that the Negro's\n\ncontact with white society has opened new vistas, new ideals in his imagination, and these he defends by repression, freezing up against the desire to be white, to have normal social intercourse with whites, to behave like them. . . . But in coolness he evades the issue . . . he becomes a pacifist in the struggle between social groups-not a conscientious objector, but a draft-dodger.\n\nThese are words that could be read as self-indictment, if anybody chose to do so. Certainly they reveal a ticklish sense of the perplexities he found himself in, and a degree of self-interrogation (as opposed to self-examination) he seldom displayed again.\n\nIn 1950, in a bar near Sheridan Square, Broyard met Anne Bernays, a Barnard junior and the daughter of Edward L. Bernays, who is considered the father of public relations. \"There was this guy who was the handsomest man I have ever seen in my life, and I fell madly in love with him,\" Bernays, who is best known for such novels as \"Growing Up Rich\" and \"Professor Romeo,\" recalls. \"He was physically irresistible, and he had this dominating personality, and I guess I needed to be dominated. His hair was so short that you couldn't tell whether it was curly or straight. He had high cheekbones and very smooth skin.\" She knew that he was black, through a mutual friend, the poet and Blake scholar Milton Klonsky. (Years later, in a sort of epiphany, she recognized Anatole's loping walk as an African-American cultural style: \"It was almost as if this were inside him dying to get out and express itself, but he felt he couldn't do it.\")\n\nAfter graduation, she got a job as an editor at the literary semiannual Discovery . She persuaded Broyard to submit his work, and in 1954 the magazine ran a short story entitled \"What the Cystoscope Said\"-an extraordinary account of his father's terminal illness:\n\nI didn't recognize him at first, he was so bad. His mouth was open and his breathing was hungry. They had removed his false teeth, and his cheeks were so thin that his mouth looked like a keyhole. I leaned over his bed and brought my face before his eyes. \"Hello darlin',\" he whispered, and he smiled. His voice, faint as it was, was full of love, and it bristled the hairs on the nape of my neck and raised goose flesh on my forearms. I couldn't speak, so I kissed him. His cheek smelled like wax.\n\nOvernight, Broyard's renown was raised to a higher level. \"Broyard knocked people flat with 'What the Cystoscope Said,' \" Lish recalls. One of those people was Burt Britton, a bookseller who later co‐founded Books & Co. In the fifties, he says, he read the works of young American writers religiously: \"Now, if writing were a horse race, which God knows it's not, I would have gone out and put my two bucks down on Broyard.\" In \"Advertisements for Myself,\" Norman Mailer wrote that he'd buy a novel by Broyard the day it appeared. Indeed, Bernays recalls, on the basis of that story the Atlantic Monthly Press offered Broyard a twenty-thousand-dollar advance-then a staggeringly large sum for a literary work by an unknown-for a novel of which \"Cystoscope\" would be a chapter. \"The whole literary world was waiting with bated breath for this great novelist who was about to arrive,\" Michael Vincent Miller, a friend of Broyard's since the late fifties, recalls. \"Some feelings of expectation lasted for years.\"\n\nRumor surrounded Broyard like a gentle murmur, and sometimes it became a din. Being an orphan of the avant-garde was hard work. Among the black literati, certainly, his ancestry was a topic of speculation, and when a picture of Broyard accompanied a 1958 Time review of a Beat anthology it was closely scrutinized. Arna Bontemps wrote to Langston Hughes, \"His picture . . . makes him look Negroid. If so he is the only spade among the Beat Generation.\" Charlie Parker spied Broyard in Washington Square Park one day and told a companion, \"He's one of us, but he doesn't want to admit he's one of us.\" Richard Gilman recalls an awkwardness that ensued when he stumbled across Anatole with his dark-skinned wife and child: \"I just happened to come upon them in a restaurant that was not near our usual stomping grounds. He introduced me, and it was fine, but my sense was that he would rather not have had anyone he knew meet them.\" He adds, \"I remember thinking at the time that he had the look of an octoroon or a quadroon, one of those-which he strenuously denied. He got into very great disputes with people.\"\n\nOne of those disputes was with Chandler Brossard, who had been a close friend: Broyard was the best man at Brossard's wedding. There was a falling out, and Brossard produced an unflattering portrait of Broyard as the hustler and opportunist Henry Porter in his 1952 novel, \"Who Walk in Darkness.\" Brossard knew just where Broyard was most vulnerable, and he pushed hard. His novel originally began, \"People said Henry Porter was a Negro,\" and the version published in France still does. Apparently fearing legal action, however, Brossard's American publisher, New Directions, sent it to Broyard in galley form before it was published.\n\nAnne Bernays was with Broyard when the galleys arrived. Broyard explained to her, \"They asked me to read it because they are afraid I am going to sue.\" But why would he sue, she wanted to know. \"Because it says I'm a Negro,\" he replied grimly. \"Then,\" Bernays recalls, \"I said, 'What are you going to do?' He said, 'I am going to make them change it.' And he did.\"\n\nThe novel went on to be celebrated as a groundbreaking chronicle of Village hipsters; it also-as a result of the legal redactions-reads rather oddly in places. Henry Porter, the Broyard character, is rumored to be not a Negro but merely \"an illegitimate\":\n\nI suspect [the rumor] was supposed to explain the difference between the way he behaved and the way the rest of us behaved. Porter did not show that he knew people were talking about him this way. I must give him credit for maintaining a front of indifference that was really remarkable.\n\nSomeone both Porter and I knew quite well once told me the next time he saw Porter he was going to ask him if he was or was not an illegitimate. He said it was the only way to clear the air. Maybe so. But I said I would not think of doing it. . . . I felt that if Porter ever wanted the stories about himself cleared up, publicly, he would one day do so. I was willing to wait.\n\nAnd that, after all, is the nature of such secrets: they are not what cannot be known but what cannot be acknowledged.\n\nAnother trip wire seems to have landed Broyard in one of the masterpieces of twentieth-century American fiction, William Gaddis's \"The Recognitions.\" Livelli explains, \"Now, around 1947 or '48, William Gaddis and Anatole were in love with the same gal, Sheri Martinelli. They were rivals, almost at each other's throats. And Willie was such a sweetheart that he had a mild approach to everything, and Anatole was sort of a stabber: he injected words like poison into conversations.\" When \"The Recognitions\" came out, in 1955, \"Anatole caught on to it right away, and he was kind of angry over it.\" The Broyard character is named Max, and Gaddis wrote that he \"always looked the same, always the same age, his hair always the same short length,\" seemingly \"a parody on the moment, as his clothes caricatured a past at eastern colleges where he had never been.\" Worse is his \"unconscionable smile,\" which intimates \"that the wearer knew all of the dismal secrets of some evil jungle whence he had just come.\"\n\nBroyard's own account of these years-published in 1993 as \"Kafka Was the Rage\"-is fuelled by the intertwined themes of writing and women. Gaddis says, \"His eyes were these great pools-soft, gentle pools. It was girls, girls, girls: a kind of intoxication of its own. I always thought, frankly, that that's where his career went, his creative energies.\"\n\nAnne Bernays maintains, \"If you leave the sex part out, you're only telling half the story. With women, he was just like an alcoholic with booze.\" She stopped seeing him in 1952, at her therapist's urging. \"It was like going cold turkey off a drug,\" she says, remembering how crushing the experience was, and she adds, \"I think most women have an Anatole in their lives.\"\n\nIndeed, not a few of them had Anatole. \"He was a pussy gangster, really,\" Lucas, a former professor of comparative literature, says with Bed-Stuy bluntness. Gilman recalls being in Bergdorf Goodman and coming across Broyard putting the moves on a salesgirl. \"I hid behind a pillar-otherwise he'd know that I'd seen him-and watched him go through every stage of seduction: 'What do you think? Can I put this against you? Oh, it looks great against your skin. You have the most wonderful skin.' And then he quoted Baudelaire.\"\n\nQuoting Baudelaire turns out to be key. Broyard's great friend Ernest van den Haag recalls trolling the Village with Broyard in those days: \"We obviously quite often compared our modus operandi, and what I observed about Anatole is that when he liked a girl he could speak to her brilliantly about all kinds of things which the girl didn't in the least understand, because Anatole was really vastly erudite. The girl had no idea what he was talking about, but she loved it, because she was under the impression, rightly so, that she was listening to something very interesting and important. His was a solipsistic discourse, in some ways.\" Indeed, the narrator of \"What the Cystoscope Said\" tells of seducing his ailing father's young and ingenuous nurse in a similar manner:\n\n\"Listen,\" I said, borrowing a tone of urgency from another source, \"I want to give you a book. A book that was written for you, a book that belongs to you as much as your diary, that's dedicated to you like your nurse's certificate.\" . . . My apartment was four blocks away, so I bridged the distance with talk, raving about Journey to the End of the Night , the book she needed like she needed a hole in her head.\n\nBroyard recognized that seduction was a matter not only of talking but of listening, too, and he knew how to pay attention with an engulfing level of concentration. The writer Ellen Schwamm, who met Broyard in the late fifties, says, \"You show me a man who talks, and I'll show you a thousand women who hurl themselves at his feet. I don't mean just talk, I mean dialogues . He listened, and he was willing to speak of things that most men are not interested in: literature and its effect on life.\" But she also saw another side to Broyard's relentless need to seduce. She invokes a formulation made by her husband, the late Harold Brodkey: \"Harold used to say that a lot of men steal from women. They steal bits of their souls, bits of their personalities, to construct an emotional life, which many men don't have. And I think that Anatole needed something of that sort.\"\n\nIt's an image of self-assemblage which is very much in keeping with Broyard's own accounts of himself. Starting in 1946, and continuing at intervals for the rest of his life, he underwent analysis. Yet the word \"analysis\" is misleading: what he wanted was to be refashioned-or, as he told his first analyst, to be transfigured . \"When I came out with the word, I was like someone who sneezes into a handkerchief and finds it full of blood,\" he wrote in the 1993 memoir. \"I wanted to discuss my life with him not as a patient talking to an analyst but as if we were two literary critics discussing a novel. . . . I had a literature rather than a personality, a set of fictions about myself.\" He lived a lie because he didn't want to live a larger lie: and Anatole Broyard, Negro writer, was that larger lie.\n\nAlexandra Nelson, known as Sandy, met Broyard in January of 1961. Broyard was forty, teaching the odd course at the New School and supporting himself by freelancing: promotional copy for publishers, liner notes for Columbia jazz records, blurbs for the Book-of-the-Month Club. Sandy was twenty-three and a dancer, and Broyard had always loved dancers. Of Norwegian descent, she was strikingly beautiful, and strikingly intelligent. Michael Miller recalls, \"She represented a certain kind of blonde, a certain kind of sophisticated carnage and a way of moving through the world with a sense of the good things. They both had marvellous taste.\"\n\nIt was as if a sorcerer had made a list of everything Broyard loved and had given it life. At long last, the conqueror was conquered: in less than a year, Broyard and Sandy were married. Sandy remembers his aura in those days: \"Anatole was very hip. It wasn't a pose-it was in his sinew, in his bones. And, when he was talking to you, you just felt that you were receiving all this radiance from him.\" (Van den Haag says, \"I do think it's not without significance that Anatole married a blonde, and about as white as you can get. He may have feared a little bit that the children might turn out black. He must have been pleased that they didn't.\")\n\nWhile they were still dating, two of Broyard's friends told Sandy that he was black, in what seemed to be a clumsy attempt to scare her off. \"I think they really weren't happy to lose him, to see him get into a serious relationship,\" she says. \"They were losing a playmate, in a way.\" Whatever the cultural sanctions, she was unfazed. But she says that when she asked Broyard about it he proved evasive: \"He claimed that he wasn't black, but he talked about 'island influences,' or said that he had a grandmother who used to live in a tree on some island in the Caribbean. Anatole was like that-he was very slippery.\" Sandy didn't force the issue, and the succeeding years only fortified his sense of reserve. \"Anatole was very strong,\" she says. \"And he said about certain things, 'Just keep out. This is the deal if you get mixed up with me.' \" The life that Broyard chose to live meant that the children did not meet their Aunt Shirley until after his death-nor, except for a couple of brief visits in the sixties, was there any contact even with Broyard's light-skinned mother and older sister. It was a matter of respecting the ground rules. \"I would try to poke in those areas, but the message was very direct and strong,\" Sandy explains. \"Oh, when I got angry at him, you know, one always pushes the tender points. But over time you grow up about these things and realize you do what you can do and there are certain things you can't.\"\n\nIn 1963, just before their first child, Todd, was born, Anatole shocked his friends by another big move-to Connecticut. Not only was he moving to Connecticut but he was going to be commuting to work: for the first time in his life, he would be a company man. \"I think one of his claims to fame was that he hadn't had an office job-somehow, he'd escaped that,\" Sandy says. \"There had been no real need for him to grow up.\" But after Todd was born-a daughter, Bliss, followed in 1966-Anatole spent seven years working full-time as a copywriter at the Manhattan advertising agency Wunderman Ricotta & Kline.\n\nOver the next quarter century, the family lived in a series of eighteenth-century houses, sometimes bought on impulse, in places like Fairfield, Redding, Greens Farms, and Southport. Here, in a land of leaf-blowers and lawnmowers, Bed-Stuy must have seemed almost comically remote. Many of Broyard's intimates from the late forties knew about his family; the intimates he acquired in the sixties did not, or else had heard only rumors. Each year, the number of people who knew Buddy from Bed-Stuy dwindled; each year, the rumors grew more nebulous; each year, he left his past further behind. Miller says, \"Anatole was a master at what Erving Goffman calls 'impression management.' \" The writer Evelyn Toynton says, \"I remember once going to a party with Sandy and him in Connecticut. There were these rather dull people there, stockbrokers and the usual sorts of people, and Anatole just knocked himself out to charm every single person in the room. I said to him, 'Anatole, can't you ever not be charming?' \" Miller observes, \"He was a wonderful host. He could take people from different walks of life-the president of Stanley Tools or a vice-president of Merrill Lynch, say, and some bohemian type from the Village-and keep the whole scene flowing beautifully. He had perfect pitch for the social encounter, like Jay Gatsby.\"\n\nIt was as if, wedded to an ideal of American self-fashioning, he sought to put himself to the ultimate test. It was one thing to be accepted in the Village, amid the Beats and hipsters and émigrés, but to gain acceptance in Cheever territory was an achievement of a higher order. \"Anatole, when he left the Village and went to Connecticut, was able not only to pass but even to be a kind of influential presence in that world of rich white Wasps,\" Miller says. \"Maybe that was a shallower part of the passing-to be accepted by Connecticut gentry.\"\n\nBroyard's feat raised eyebrows among some of his literary admirers: something borrowed, something new. Daphne Merkin, another longtime friend, detected \"a 'country-squire' tendency-a complicated tendency to want to establish a sort of safety through bourgeoisness. It was like a Galsworthy quality.\"\n\nEven in Arcadia, however, there could be no relaxation of vigilance: in his most intimate relationships, there were guardrails. Broyard once wrote that Michael Miller was one of the people he liked best in the world, and Miller is candid about Broyard's profound influence on him. Today, Miller is a psychotherapist, based in Cambridge, and the author, most recently, of \"Intimate Terrorism.\" From the time they met until his death, Broyard read to him the first draft of almost every piece he wrote. Yet a thirty-year friendship of unusual intimacy was circumscribed by a subject that they never discussed. \"First of all, I didn't know ,\" Miller says. \"I just had intuitions and had heard intimations. It was some years before I'd even put together some intuition and little rumblings-nothing ever emerged clearly. There was a certain tacit understanding between us to accept certain pathways as our best selves, and not challenge that too much.\" It was perhaps, he says a little sadly, a limitation on the relationship.\n\nIn the late sixties, Broyard wrote several front-page reviews for the Times Book Review . \"They were brilliant, absolutely sensational,\" the novelist Charles Simmons, who was then an assistant editor there, says. In 1971, the Times was casting about for a new daily reviewer, and Simmons was among those who suggested Anatole Broyard. It wasn't a tough sell. Arthur Gelb, at the time the paper's cultural editor, recalls, \"Anatole was among the first critics I brought to the paper. He was very funny, and he also had that special knack for penetrating hypocrisy. I don't think he was capable of uttering a boring sentence.\"\n\nYou could say that his arrival was a sign of the times. Imagine: Anatole Broyard, downtown flaneur and apostle of sex and high modernism, ensconced in what was, literarily speaking, the ultimate establishment perch. \"There had been an awful lot of very tame, very conventional people at the Times , and Broyard came in as a sort of ambassador from the Village and Village sophistication,\" Alfred Kazin recalls. Broyard had a highly developed appreciation of the paper's institutional power, and he even managed to use it to avenge wrongs done him in his Village days. Just before he started his job at the daily, he published a review in the Times Book Review of a new novel by one Chandler Brossard. The review began, \"Here's a book so transcendently bad it makes us fear not only for the condition of the novel in this country, but for the country itself.\"\n\nBroyard's reviews were published in alternation with those of Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, who has now been a daily reviewer at the Times for more than a quarter century, and who readily admits that Broyard's appointment did not gladden his heart. They hadn't got along particularly well when Lehmann-Haupt was an editor at the Times Book Review , nor did Lehmann-Haupt entirely approve of Broyard's status as a fabled libertine. So when A. M. Rosenthal, the paper's managing editor, was considering hiring him, Lehmann-Haupt expressed reservations. He recalls, \"Rosenthal was saying, 'Give me five reasons why not.' And I thoughtlessly blurted out, 'Well, first of all, he is the biggest ass man in town.' And Rosenthal rose up from his desk and said, 'If that were a disqualification for working for the New York Times' -and he waved-'this place would be empty!' \"\n\nBroyard got off to an impressive start. Lehmann-Haupt says, \"He had a wonderful way of setting a tone, and a wonderful way of talking himself through a review. He had good, tough instincts when it came to fiction. He had taste.\" And the jovial Herbert Mitgang, who served a stint as a daily reviewer himself, says, \"I always thought he was the most literary of the reviewers. There would be something like a little essay in his daily reviews.\"\n\nOccasionally, his acerbic opinions got him in trouble. There was, for example, the storm that attended an uncharitable review of a novel by Christy Brown, an Irish writer who was born with severe cerebral palsy. The review concluded:\n\nIt is unfortunate that the author of \"A Shadow on Summer\" is an almost total spastic-he is said to have typed his highly regarded first novel, \"Down All the Days,\" with his left foot-but I don't see how the badness of his second novel can be blamed on that. Any man who can learn to type with his left foot can learn to write better than he has here.\n\nThen, there was the controversial review of James Baldwin's piously sentimental novel of black suffering, \"If Beale Street Could Talk.\" Broyard wrote:\n\nIf I have to read one more description of the garbage piled up in the streets of Harlem, I may just throw protocol to the winds and ask whose garbage is it? I would like to remind Mr. Baldwin that the City Health Code stipulates that garbage must be put out in proper containers, not indiscriminately \"piled.\"\n\nNo one could accuse Broyard of proselytizing for progressive causes. Jason Epstein, for one, was quick to detect a neoconservative air in his reviews, and Broyard's old friend Ernest van den Haag, a longtime contributing editor at National Review , volunteers that he was available to set Broyard straight on the issues when the need arose. Broyard could be mischievous, and he could be tendentious. It did not escape notice that he was consistently hostile to feminist writers. \"Perhaps it's naïve of me to expect people to write reasonable books about emotionally charged subjects,\" one such review began, irritably. \"But when you have to read and review two or three books each week, you do get tired of 'understanding' so much personal bias. You reach a point where it no longer matters that the author's mistakes are well meant. You don't care that he or she is on the side of the angels: you just want them to tell the truth.\"\n\nNor did relations between the two daily reviewers ever become altogether cordial. Lehmann-Haupt tells of a time in 1974 when Broyard said that he was sick and couldn't deliver a review. Lehmann-Haupt had to write an extra review in less than a day, so that he could get to the Ali-Frazier fight the next night, where he had ringside seats. Later, when they discussed the match, Broyard seemed suspiciously knowledgeable about its particulars; he claimed that a friend of his had been invited by a television executive to watch it on closed-circuit TV. \"I waited about six months, because one of the charming things about Anatole was that he never remembered his lies,\" Lehmann-Haupt says, laughing. \"And I said, 'Did you see that fight?' And he said, 'Oh, yeah-I was there as a guest of this television executive.' That's why he couldn't write the review!\"\n\nBroyard had been teaching off and on at the New School since the late fifties, and now his reputation as a writing teacher began to soar. Certainly his fluent prose style, with its combination of grace and clarity, was a considerable recommendation. He was charismatic and magisterial, and, because he was sometimes brutal about students' work, they found it all the more gratifying when he was complimentary. Among his students were Paul Breslow, Robert Olen Butler, Daphne Merkin, and Hilma Wolitzer. Ellen Schwamm, who took a workshop with him in the early seventies, says, \"He had a gourmet's taste for literature and for language, and he was really able to convey that: it was a very sensual experience.\"\n\nThese were years of heady success and, at the same time, of a rising sense of failure. An arbiter of American writing, Broyard was racked by his inability to write his own magnum opus. In the fifties, the Atlantic Monthly Press had contracted for an autobiographical novel-the novel that was supposed to secure Broyard's fame, his place in contemporary literature-but, all these years later, he had made no progress. It wasn't for lack of trying. Lehmann-Haupt recalls his taking a lengthy vacation in order to get the book written. \"I remember talking to him-he was up in Vermont, where somebody had lent him a house-and he was in agony. He banished himself from the Vineyard, was clearly suffering, and he just couldn't do it.\" John Updike, who knew Broyard slightly from the Vineyard, was reminded of the anticipation surrounding Ellison's second novel: \"The most famous non-book around was the one that Broyard was not writing.\" (The two non-book writers were in fact quite friendly: Broyard admired Ellison not only as a writer but as a dancer-a high tribute from such an adept as Broyard.)\n\nSurrounded by analysts and psychotherapists-Sandy Broyard had become a therapist herself by this time-Broyard had no shortage of explanations for his inability to write his book. \"He did have a total writer's block,\" van den Haag says, \"and he was analyzed by various persons, but it didn't fully overcome the writer's block. I couldn't prevent him from going back to 'The Cystoscope' and trying to improve it. He made it, of course, not better but worse.\" Broyard's fluency as an essayist and a reviewer wasn't quite compensation. Charles Simmons says, \"He had produced all this charming criticism, but the one thing that mattered to him was the one thing he hadn't managed to do.\"\n\nAs the seventies wore on, Miller discussed the matter of blockage with his best friend in relatively abstract terms: he suggested that there might be something in Broyard's relationship to his family background that was holding him back. In the eighties, he referred Broyard to his own chief mentor in gestalt therapy, Isador From, and From became perhaps Broyard's most important therapist in his later years. \"In gestalt therapy, we talk a lot about 'unfinished business': anything that's incomplete, unfinished, haunts the whole personality and tends, at some level, to create inhibition or blockage,\" Miller says. \"You're stuck there at a certain point. It's like living with a partly full bladder all your life.\"\n\nSome people speculated that the reason Broyard couldn't write his novel was that he was living it-that race loomed larger in his life because it was unacknowledged, that he couldn't put it behind him because he had put it beneath him. If he had been a different sort of writer, it might not have mattered so much. But Merkin points out, \"Anatole's subject, even in fiction, was essentially himself. I think that ultimately he would have had to deal with more than he wanted to deal with.\"\n\nBroyard may have been the picture of serene self-mastery, but there was one subject that could reliably fluster him. Gordon Lish recalls an occasion in the mid-seventies when Burt Britton (who was married to a black woman) alluded to Anatole's racial ancestry. Lish says, \"Anatole became inflamed, and he left the room. He snapped, like a dog snapping-he barked at Britton. It was an ugly moment.\" To people who knew nothing about the matter, Broyard's sensitivities were at times simply perplexing. The critic Judith Dunford used to go to lunch with Broyard in the eighties. One day, Broyard mentioned his sister Shirley, and Dunford, idly making conversation, asked him what she looked like. Suddenly, she saw an extremely worried expression on his face. Very carefully, he replied, \"Darker than me.\"\n\nThere was, finally, no sanctuary. \"When the children were older, I began, every eighteen months or so, to bring up the issue of how they needed to know at some point,\" Sandy Broyard says. \"And then he would totally shut down and go into a rage. He'd say that at some point he would tell them, but he would not tell them now.\" He was the Scheherazade of racial imposture, seeking and securing one deferral after another. It must have made things not easier but harder. In the modern era, children are supposed to come out to their parents: it works better that way around. For children, we know, can judge their parents harshly-above all, for what they understand as failures of candor. His children would see the world in terms of authenticity; he saw the world in terms of self-creation. Would they think that he had made a Faustian bargain? Would they speculate about what else he had not told them-about the limits of self-invention? Broyard's resistance is not hard to fathom. He must have wondered when the past would learn its place, and stay past.\n\nAnatole Broyard had confessed enough in his time to know that confession did nothing for the soul. He preferred to communicate his truths on higher frequencies. As if in exorcism, Broyard's personal essays deal regularly with the necessary, guilt-ridden endeavor of escaping family history: and yet the feelings involved are well-nigh universal. The thematic elements of passing-fragmentation, alienation, liminality, self-fashioning-echo the great themes of modernism. As a result, he could prepare the way for exposure without ever risking it. Miller observes, \"If you look at the writing closely enough, and listen to the intonations, there's something there that is like no writer from the completely white world. Freud talked about the repetition compulsion. With Anatole, it's interesting that he was constantly hiding it and in some ways constantly revealing it.\"\n\nSandy speaks of these matters in calmly analytic tones; perhaps because she is a therapist, her love is tempered by an almost professional dispassion. She says, \"I think his own personal history continued to be painful to him,\" and she adds, \"In passing, you cause your family great anguish, but I also think, conversely, do we look at the anguish it causes the person who is passing? Or the anguish that it was born out of?\"\n\nIt may be tempting to describe Broyard's self-positioning as arising from a tortured allegiance to some liberal-humanist creed. In fact, the liberal pieties of the day were not much to his taste. \"It wasn't about an ideal of racelessness but something much more complex and interesting,\" Miller says. \"He was actually quite anti-black,\" Evelyn Toynton says. She tells of a time when she was walking with him on a street in New York and a drunken black man came up to him and asked for a dollar. Broyard seethed. Afterward, he remarked to her, \"I look around New York, and I think to myself, If there were no blacks in New York, would it really be any loss?\"\n\nNo doubt this is a calculation that whites, even white liberals, sometimes find themselves idly working out: How many black muggers is one Thelonious Monk worth? How many Willie Hortons does Gwendolyn Brooks redeem? In 1970, Ellison published his classic essay \"What America Would Be Like Without Blacks,\" in Time ; and one reason it is a classic essay is that it addresses a question that lingers in the American political unconscious. Commanding as Ellison's arguments are, there remains a whit of defensiveness in the very exercise. It's a burdensome thing to refute a fantasy.\n\nAnd a burdensome thing to be privy to it. Ellen Schwamm recalls that one of the houses Broyard had in Connecticut had a black jockey on the lawn, and that \"he used to tell me that Jimmy Baldwin had said to him, 'I can't come and see you with this crap on your lawn.' \" (Sandy remembers the lawn jockey-an antique-as having come with the house; she also recalls that it was stolen one day.) Charles Simmons says that the writer Herbert Gold, before introducing him to Broyard, warned him that Broyard was prone to make comments about \"spades,\" and Broyard did make a few such comments. \"He personally, on a deeper level, was not enamored of blacks,\" van den Haag says. \"He avoided blacks. There is no question he did.\" Sandy is gingerly in alluding to this subject. \"He was very short-tempered with the behavior of black people, the sort of behavior that was shown in the news. He had paid the price to be at liberty to say things that, if you didn't know he was black, you would misunderstand. I think it made him ironical.\"\n\nEvery once in a while, however, Broyard's irony would slacken, and he would speak of the thing with an unaccustomed and halting forthrightness. Toynton says that after they'd known each other for several years he told her there was a \"C\" (actually, \"col,\" for \"colored\") on his birth certificate. \"And then another time he told me that his sister was black and that she was married to a black man.\" The circumlocutions are striking: not that he was black but that his birth certificate was; not that he was black but that his family was. Perhaps this was a matter less of evasiveness than of precision.\n\n\"Some shrink had said to him that the reason he didn't like brown-haired women or dark women was that he was afraid of his own shit,\" Toynton continues. \"And I said, 'Anatole, it's as plain as plain can be that it has to do with being black.' And he just stopped and said, 'You don't know what it was like. It was horrible.' He told me once that he didn't like to see his sisters, because they reminded him of his unhappy childhood.\" (Shirley's account suggests that this unhappy childhood may have had more to do with the child than with the hood.)\n\nEllen Schwamm remembers one occasion when Broyard visited her and Harold Brodkey at their apartment, and read them part of the memoir he was working on. She says that the passages seemed stilted and distant, and that Brodkey said to him, \"You're not telling the truth, and if you try to write lies or evade the truth this is what you get. What's the real story?\" She says, \"Anatole took a deep breath and said, 'The real story is that I'm not who I seem. I'm a black.' I said, 'Well, Anatole, it's no great shock, because this rumor has been around for years and years and years, and everyone assumes there's a small percentage of you that's black, if that's what you're trying to say.' And he said, 'No, that's not what I'm trying to say. My father could pass, but in fact my mother's black, too. We're black as far back as I know.' We never said a word of it to anybody, because he asked us not to.\"\n\nSchwamm also says that she begged him to write about his history: it seemed to her excellent material for a book. But he explained that he didn't want notoriety based on his race-on his revealing himself to be black-rather than on his talent. As Toynton puts it, Broyard felt that he had to make a choice between being an aesthete and being a Negro. \"He felt that once he said, 'I'm a Negro writer,' he would have to write about black issues, and Anatole was such an aesthete.\"\n\nAll the same, Schwamm was impressed by a paradox: the man wanted to be appreciated not for being black but for being a writer, even though his pretending not to be black was stopping him from writing. It was one of the very few ironies that Broyard, the master ironist, was ill equipped to appreciate.\n\nBesides, there was always his day job to attend to. Broyard might suffer through a midnight of the soul in Vermont; but he was also a working journalist, and when it came to filing his copy he nearly always met his deadlines. In the late seventies, he also began publishing brief personal essays in the Times . They are among the finest work he did-easeful, witty, perfectly poised between surface and depth. In them he perfected the feat of being self-revelatory without revealing anything. He wrote about his current life, in Connecticut: \"People in New York City have psychotherapists, and people in the suburbs have handymen. While anxiety in the city is existential, in the country it is structural.\" And he wrote about his earlier life, in the city: \"There was a kind of jazz in my father's movements, a rhythm compounded of economy and flourishes, functional and decorative. He had a blues song in his blood, a wistful jauntiness he brought with him from New Orleans.\" (Wistful, and even worrisome: \"I half-expected him to break into the Camel Walk, the Shimmy Shewobble, the Black Bottom or the Mess Around.\") In a 1979 essay he wrote about how much he dreaded family excursions:\n\nTo me, they were like a suicide pact. Didn't my parents know that the world was just waiting for a chance to come between us?\n\nInside, we were a family, but outside we were immigrants, bizarre in our differences. I thought that people stared at us, and my face grew hot. At any moment, I expected my father and mother to expose their tribal rites, their eccentric anthropology, to the gape of strangers.\n\nAnyone who saw me with my family knew too much about me.\n\nThese were the themes he returned to in many of his personal essays, seemingly marking out the threshold he would not cross. And if some of his colleagues at the Times knew too much about him, or had heard the rumors, they wouldn't have dreamed of saying anything. Abe Rosenthal (who did know about him) says that the subject never arose. \"What was there to talk about? I didn't really consider it my business. I didn't think it was proper or polite, nor did I want him to think I was prejudiced, or anything.\"\n\nBut most people knew nothing about it. C. Gerald Fraser, a reporter and an editor at the Times from 1967 until 1991, was friendly with Broyard's brother-in-law Ambassador Franklin Williams. Fraser, who is black, recalls that one day Williams asked him how many black journalists there were at the Times . \"I listed them,\" he says, \"and he said, 'You forgot one.' I went over the list again, and I said, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'Shirley's brother, Anatole Broyard.' I was dumbstruck, because I'd never heard it mentioned at the Times that he was black, or that the paper had a black critic.\"\n\nIn any event, Broyard's colleagues did not have to know what he was to have reservations about who he was. He cultivated his image as a trickster-someone who would bend the rules, finesse the system-and that image only intensified his detractors' ire. \"A good book review is an act of seduction, and when he did it there was nobody better,\" John Leonard says, but he feels that Broyard's best was not always offered. \"I considered him to be one of the laziest book reviewers to come down the pike.\" Soon a running joke was that Broyard would review only novels shorter than two hundred pages. In the introduction to \"Aroused by Books,\" a collection of the reviews he published in the early seventies, Broyard wrote that he tried to choose books for review that were \"closest to [his] feelings.\" Lehmann-Haupt says dryly, \"We began to suspect that he often picked the books according to the attractiveness of the young female novelists who had written them.\" Rosenthal had shamed him for voicing his disquiet about Broyard's reputation as a Don Juan, but before long Rosenthal himself changed his tune. \"Maybe five or six years later,\" Lehmann-Haupt recalls, \"Rosenthal comes up to me, jabbing me in the chest with a stiffened index finger and saying, 'The trouble with Broyard is that he writes with his cock!' I bit my tongue.\"\n\nGradually, a measure of discontent with Broyard's reviews began to make itself felt among the paper's cultural commissars. Harvey Shapiro, the editor of the Book Review from 1975 to 1983, recalls conversations with Rosenthal in which \"he would tell me that all his friends hated Anatole's essays, and I would tell him that all my friends loved Anatole's essays, and that would be the end of the conversation.\" In 1984, Broyard was removed from the daily Times and given a column in the Book Review .\n\nMitchel Levitas, the editor of the Book Review from 1983 to 1989, edited Broyard's column himself. He says, \"It was a tough time for him, you see, because he had come off the daily book review, where he was out there in the public eye twice a week. That was a major change in his public role.\" In addition to writing his column, he was put to work as an editor at the Book Review . The office environment was perhaps not altogether congenial to a man of his temperament. Kazin recalls, \"He complained to me constantly about being on the Book Review , because he had to check people's quotations and such. I think he thought that he was superior to the job.\"\n\nThen, too, it was an era in which the very notion of passing was beginning to seem less plangent than preposterous. Certainly Broyard's skittishness around the subject wasn't to everyone's liking. Brent Staples, who is black, was an editor at the Book Review at the time Broyard was there \"Anatole had it both ways,\" Staples says. \"He would give you a kind of burlesque wink that seemed to indicate he was ready to accept the fact of your knowing that he was a black person. It was a real ambiguity, tacit and sort of recessed. He jived around and played with it a lot, but never made it express the fact that he was black.\" It was a game that tried Staples' patience. \"When Anatole came anywhere near me, for example, his whole style, demeanor, and tone would change,\" he recalls. \"I took that as him conveying to me, 'Yes, I am like you. But I'm relating this to you on a kind of recondite channel.' Over all, it made me angry. Here was a guy who was, for a long period of time, probably one of the two or three most important critical voices on literature in the United States. How could you, actively or passively, have this fact hidden?\"\n\nStaples pauses, then says, \"You know, he turned it into a joke. And when you change something basic about yourself into a joke, it spreads, it metastasizes, and so his whole presentation of self became completely ironic. Everything about him was ironic.\"\n\nThere were some people who came to have a professional interest in achieving a measure of clarity on the topic. Not long before Broyard retired from the Times , in 1989, Daphne Merkin, as an editor at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, gave him an advance of a hundred thousand dollars for his memoirs. (The completed portion was ultimately published, as \"Kafka Was the Rage,\" by Crown.) Merkin learned that \"he was, in some ways, opaque to himself,\" and her disquiet grew when the early chapters arrived. \"I said, 'Anatole, there's something odd here. Within the memoir, you have your family moving to a black neighborhood in Brooklyn. I find that strange-unless they're black.' I said, 'You can do many things if you're writing a memoir. But if you squelch stuff that seems to be crucial about you, and pretend it doesn't exist . . .' \" She observes that he was much attached to aspects of his childhood, but \"in a clouded way.\"\n\nWhen Broyard retired from the Times , he was nearly sixty-nine. To Sandy, it was a source of some anguish that their children still did not know the truth about him. Yet what was that truth? Broyard was a critic-a critic who specialized in European and American fiction. And what was race but a European and American fiction? If he was passing for white, perhaps he understood that the alternative was passing for black. \"But if some people are light enough to live like white, mother, why should there be such a fuss?\" a girl asks her mother in \"Near-White,\" a 1931 story by the Harlem Renaissance author Claude McKay. \"Why should they live colored when they could be happier living white?\" Why, indeed? One could concede that the passing of Anatole Broyard involved dishonesty; but is it so very clear that the dishonesty was mostly Broyard's?\n\nTo pass is to sin against authenticity, and \"authenticity\" is among the founding lies of the modern age. The philosopher Charles Taylor summarizes its ideology thus: \"There is a certain way of being human that is my way. I am called upon to live my life in this way, and not in imitation of anyone else's life. But this notion gives a new importance to being true to myself. If I am not, I miss the point of my life; I miss what being human is for me .\" And the Romantic fallacy of authenticity is only compounded when it is collectivized: when the putative real me gives way to the real us. You can say that Anatole Broyard was (by any juridical reckoning) \"really\" a Negro, without conceding that a Negro is a thing you can really be. The vagaries of racial identity were increased by what anthropologists call the rule of \"hypodescent\"-the one-drop rule. When those of mixed ancestry-and the majority of blacks are of mixed ancestry-disappear into the white majority, they are traditionally accused of running from their \"blackness.\" Yet why isn't the alternative a matter of running from their \"whiteness\"? To emphasize these perversities, however, is a distraction from a larger perversity. You can't get race \"right\" by refining the boundary conditions.\n\nThe act of razoring out your contributor's note may be quixotic, but it is not mad. The mistake is to assume that birth certificates and biographical sketches and all the other documents generated by the modern bureaucratic state reveal an anterior truth-that they are merely signs of an independently existing identity. But in fact they constitute it. The social meaning of race is established by these identity papers-by tracts and treatises and certificates and pamphlets and all the other verbal artifacts that proclaim race to be real and, by that proclamation, make it so.\n\nSo here is a man who passed for white because he wanted to be a writer, and he did not want to be a Negro writer. It is a crass disjunction, but it is not his crassness or his disjunction. His perception was perfectly correct. He would have had to be a Negro writer, which was something he did not want to be. In his terms, he did not want to write about black love, black passion, black suffering, black joy; he wanted to write about love and passion and suffering and joy. We give lip service to the idea of the writer who happens to be black, but had anyone, in the postwar era, ever seen such a thing?\n\nBroyard's friend Richard A. Shweder, an anthropologist and a theorist of culture, says, \"I think he believed that reality is constituted by style,\" and ascribes to Broyard a \"deeply romantic view of the intimate connection between style and reality.\" Broyard passed not because he thought that race wasn't important but because he knew that it was. The durable social facts of race were beyond reason, and, like Paul Broyard's furniture, their strength came at the expense of style. Anatole Broyard lived in a world where race had, indeed, become a trope for indelibility, for permanence. \"All I have to do,\" a black folk saying has it, \"is stay black and die.\"\n\nBroyard was a connoisseur of the liminal-of crossing over and, in the familiar phrase, getting over. But the ideologies of modernity have a kicker, which is that they permit no exit. Racial recusal is a forlorn hope. In a system where whiteness is the default, racelessness is never a possibility. You cannot opt out; you can only opt in. In a scathing review of a now forgotten black author, Broyard announced that it was time to reconsider the assumption of many black writers that \" 'whitey' will never let you forget you're black.\" For his part, he wasn't taking any chances. At a certain point, he seems to have decided that all he had to do was stay white and die.\n\nIn 1989, Broyard resolved that he and his wife would change their life once more. With both their children grown, they could do what they pleased. And what they pleased-what he pleased, anyway-was to move to Cambridge, Massachusetts. They would be near Harvard, and so part of an intellectual community. He had a vision of walking through Harvard Square, bumping into people like the sociologist Daniel Bell, and having conversations about ideas in the street. Besides, his close friend Michael Miller was living in the area. Anne Bernays, also a Cambridge resident, says, \"I remember his calling several times and asking me about neighborhoods. It was important for him to get that right. I think he was a little disappointed when he moved that it wasn't to a fancy neighborhood like Brattle or Channing Street. He was on Wendell Street, where there's a tennis court across the street and an apartment building and the houses are fairly close together.\" It wasn't a matter of passing so much as of positioning.\n\nSandy says that they had another the-children-must-be-told conversation shortly before the move. \"We were driving to Michael's fiftieth-birthday party-I used to plan to bring up the subject in a place where he couldn't walk out. I brought it up then because at that point our son was out of college and our daughter had just graduated, and my feeling was that they just absolutely needed to know, as adults.\" She pauses. \"And we had words. He would just bring down this gate.\" Sandy surmises, again, that he may have wanted to protect them from what he had experienced as a child. \"Also,\" she says, \"I think he needed still to protect himself.\" The day after they moved into their house on Wendell Street, Broyard learned that he had prostate cancer, and that it was inoperable.\n\nBroyard spent much of the time before his death, fourteen months later, making a study of the literature of illness and death, and publishing a number of essays on the subject. Despite the occasion, they were imbued with an almost dandyish, even jokey sense of incongruity: \"My urologist, who is quite famous, wanted to cut off my testicles. . . . Speaking as a surgeon, he said that it was the surest, quickest, neatest solution. Too neat, I said, picturing myself with no balls. I knew that such a solution would depress me, and I was sure that depression is bad medicine.\" He had attracted notice in 1954 with the account of his father's death from a similar cancer; now he recharged his writing career as a chronicler of his own progress toward death. He thought about calling his collection of writings on the subject \"Critically Ill.\" It was a pun he delighted in.\n\nSoon after the diagnosis was made, he was told that he might have \"in the neighborhood of years.\" Eight months later, it became clear that this prognosis was too optimistic. Richard Shweder, the anthropologist, talks about a trip to France that he and his wife made with Anatole and Sandy not long before Anatole's death. One day, the two men were left alone. Shweder says, \"And what did he want to do? He wanted to throw a ball. The two of us just played catch, back and forth.\" The moment, he believes, captures Broyard's athleticism, his love of physical grace.\n\nBroyard spent the last five weeks of his life at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, in Boston. In therapy sessions, the need to set things straight before the end had come up again-the need to deal with unfinished business and, most of all, with his secret. He appeared willing, if reluctant, to do so. But by now he was in almost constant pain, and the two children lived in different places, so the opportunities to have the discussion as a family were limited. \"Anatole was in such physical pain that I don't think he had the wherewithal,\" Sandy says. \"So he missed the opportunity to tell the children himself.\" She speaks of the expense of spirit, of psychic energy, that would have been required. The challenge would have been to explain why it had remained a secret. And no doubt the old anxieties were not easily dispelled: would it have been condemned as a Faustian bargain or understood as a case of personality overspilling, or rebelling against, the reign of category?\n\nIt pains Sandy even now that the children never had the chance to have an open discussion with their father. In the event, she felt that they needed to know before he died, and, for the first time, she took it upon herself to declare what her husband could not. It was an early afternoon, ten days before his death, when she sat down with her two children on a patch of grass across the street from the institute. \"They knew there was a family secret, and they wanted to know what their father had to tell them. And I told them.\"\n\nThe stillness of the afternoon was undisturbed. She says carefully, \"Their first reaction was relief that it was only this, and not an event or circumstance of larger proportions. Only following their father's death did they begin to feel the loss of not having known. And of having to reformulate who it was that they understood their father-and themselves-to be.\"\n\nAt this stage of his illness, Anatole was moving in and out of lucidity, but in his room Sandy and the children talked with humor and irony about secrets and about this particular secret. Even if Anatole could not participate in the conversation, he could at least listen to it. \"The nurses said that hearing was the last sense to go,\" Sandy says.\n\nIt was not as she would have planned it. She says, gently, \"Anatole always found his own way through things.\"\n\nThe writer Leslie Garis, a friend of the Broyards' from Connecticut, was in Broyard's room during the last weekend of September, 1990, and recorded much of what he said on his last day of something like sentience. He weighed perhaps seventy pounds, she guessed, and she describes his jaundice-clouded eyes as having the permanently startled look born of emaciation. He was partly lucid, mostly not. There are glimpses of his usual wit, but in a mode more aleatoric than logical. He spoke of Robert Graves, of Sheri Martinelli, of John Hawkes interpreting Miles Davis. He told Sandy that he needed to find a place to go where he could \"protect his irony.\" As if, having been protected by irony throughout his life, it was now time to return the favor.\n\n\"I think friends are coming, so I think we ought to order some food,\" he announced hours before he lapsed into his final coma. \"We'll want cheese and crackers, and Faust.\"\n\n\"Faust?\" Sandy asked.\n\nAnatole explained, \"He's the kind of guy who makes the Faustian bargain, and who can be happy only when the thing is revealed.\"\n\nA memorial service, held at a Congregationalist church in Connecticut, featured august figures from literary New York, colleagues from the Times , and neighbors and friends from the Village and the Vineyard. Charles Simmons told me that he was surprised at how hard he took Broyard's death. \"You felt that you were going to have him forever, the way you feel about your own child,\" he said. \"There was something wrong about his dying, and that was the reason.\" Speaking of the memorial service, he says, marvelling, \"You think that you're the close friend, you know? And then I realized that there were twenty people ahead of me. And that his genius was for close friends.\"\n\nIndeed, six years after Broyard's death many of his friends seem to be still mourning his loss. For them he was plainly a vital principle, a dancer and romancer, a seducer of men and women. (He considered seduction, he wrote, \"the most heartfelt literature of the self.\") Sandy tells me, simply, \"You felt more alive in his presence,\" and I've heard almost precisely the same words from a great many others. They felt that he lived more intensely than other men. They loved him-perhaps his male friends especially, or, anyway, more volubly-and they admired him. They speak of a limber beauty, of agelessness, of a radiance. They also speak of his excesses and his penchant for poses. Perhaps, as the bard has it, Broyard was \"much more the better for being a little bad.\"\n\nAnd if his presence in American fiction was pretty much limited to other people's novels, that is no small tribute to his personal vibrancy. You find him reflected and refracted in the books of his peers, like Anne Bernays (she says there is a Broyard character in every novel she's written) and Brossard and Gaddis, of course, but also in those of his students. His own great gift was as a feuilletonist. The personal essays collected in \"Men, Women and Other Anticlimaxes\" can put you in mind of \"The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table,\" by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. They are brief impromptus, tonally flawless. To read them is to feel that you are in the company of someone who is thinking things through. The essays are often urbane and sophisticated, but not unbearably so, and they can be unexpectedly moving. Literary culture still fetishizes the novel, and there he was perhaps out of step with his times. Sandy says, \"In the seventies and eighties, the trend, in literature and film, was to get sparer, and the flourish of Anatole's voice was dependent on the luxuriance of his language.\" Richard Shweder says, \"It does seem that Anatole's strength was the brief, witty remark. It was aphoristic. It was the critical review. He was brilliant in a thousand or two thousand words.\" Perhaps he wasn't destined to be a novelist, but what of it? Broyard was a Negro who wanted to be something other than a Negro, a critic who wanted to be something other than a critic. Broyard, you might say, wanted to be something other than Broyard. He very nearly succeeded.\n\nShirley Broyard Williams came to his memorial service, and many of his friends-including Alfred Kazin, who delivered one of the eulogies-remember being puzzled and then astonished as they realized that Anatole Broyard was black. For Todd and Bliss, however, meeting Aunt Shirley was, at last, a flesh-and-blood confirmation of what they had been told. Shirley is sorry that they didn't meet sooner, and she remains baffled about her brother's decision. But she isn't bitter about it; her attitude is that she has had a full and eventful life of her own-husband, kids, friends-and that if her brother wanted to keep himself aloof she respected his decision. She describes the conversations they had when they did speak: \"They always had to be focussed on something, like a movie, because you couldn't afford to be very intimate. There had to be something that would get in the way of the intimacy.\" And when she phoned him during his illness it was the same way. \"He never gave that up,\" she says, sounding more wistful than reproachful. \"He never learned how to be comfortable with me.\" So it has been a trying set of circumstances all around. \"The hypocrisy that surrounds this issue is so thick you could chew it,\" Shirley says wearily.\n\nShirley's husband died several months before Anatole, and I think she must have found it cheering to be able to meet family members who had been sequestered from her. She says that she wants to get to know her nephew and her niece-that there's a lot of time to make up. \"I've been encouraging Bliss to come and talk, and we had lunch, and she calls me on the phone. She's really responded very well. Considering that it's sort of last-minute.\"\n\nYears earlier, in an essay entitled \"Growing Up Irrational,\" Anatole Broyard wrote, \"I descended from my mother and father. I was extracted from them.\" His parents were \"a conspiracy, a plot against society,\" as he saw it, but also a source of profound embarrassment. \"Like every great tradition, my family had to die before I could understand how much I missed them and what they meant to me. When they went into the flames at the crematorium, all my letters of introduction went with them.\" Now that he had a wife and family of his own, he had started to worry about whether his children's feelings about him would reprise his feelings about his parents: \"Am I an embarrassment to them, or an accepted part of the human comedy? Have they joined my conspiracy, or are they just pretending? Do they understand that, after all those years of running away from home, I am still trying to get back?\" ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Will California Again Lead the Way on Prison Reform?\n\nFor much of the twentieth century, if you committed a serious crime in California, a judge would sentence you to an ambiguous-sounding prison term-say, five years to life. While you were serving your sentence, a parole board would review your record and decide how long the rest of the sentence should be, based on factors such as your behavior and your participation in prison rehabilitation programs. The idea was to take the specifics of the crime into account in the original sentencing, and then to reward those who seemed to be taking steps toward genuine rehabilitation.\n\nBut in the sixties and seventies, liberal lawmakers, influenced by the civil-rights movement, started to observe that the racial and class biases of parole-board members were influencing their decisions. At the same time, conservatives, troubled by rising crime, began to argue that parole boards had too much power, which was leading to lenient sentencing decisions. In 1976, under pressure from both sides, Governor Jerry Brown, a moderate Democrat, signed a law mandating \"determinate\" sentences in California: from then on, judges would choose from a set of firm sentences for each crime, stripping power from fickle and possibly racist parole boards. \"It is the most far-reaching criminal-justice reform in the last fifty years,\" Brown said at the time. The reform was far-reaching, but perhaps not in the way that Brown had expected. California's prison population began to balloon-the determinate sentences, set by the state legislature, turned out to be longer, on average, than the indeterminate ones.\n\nThis trend was compounded by new federal laws that were passed in the aftermath of California's (and of one passed by New York earlier in the seventies, which enacted strict penalties for selling drugs). Among them was the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act , signed by Bill Clinton, which included the notorious \"Three Strikes, You're Out\" provision, for dealing with repeat offenders. Many states enacted similar tough-on-crime measures. In 1978, state prisons held a hundred and twenty-three people for each hundred thousand U.S. residents; by 2007, that figure had risen to four hundred and sixty-one. The effects were disproportionately felt by low-income men of color. As Adam Gopnik wrote, in a 2012 article about the prison boom , \"For most privileged, professional people, the experience of confinement is a mere brush, encountered after a kid's arrest, say. For a great many poor people in America, particularly poor black men, prison is a destination that braids through an ordinary life, much as high school and college do for rich white ones.\"\n\nA great deal has happened over the past several decades to precipitate a change in public sentiment about prisons. In the late seventies, voters and politicians on the left were preoccupied with civil rights, and, on the right, with crime. But over the following decades, liberals became more focussed on the systems that perpetuate economic inequality-subpar schools, low access to healthcare, and, yes, high incarceration rates-and conservatives began to concentrate on government spending. When the recession of the late aughts devastated state budgets, liberal and conservative concerns converged: this time, liberals sought to lower imprisonment rates in service of social justice and in order to free up resources for education and health programs, while conservatives sought the same in service of reduced spending. A prison exodus began not only in California and other blue states but also in conservative states such as Texas.\n\nBy the time Brown was inaugurated as governor for a third time, in 2011, California's prison population had already fallen, but it was largely because his Republican predecessor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, had transferred thousands of prisoners to out-of-state facilities. A few months after Brown became governor, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that California's prisons were so overcrowded as to constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy called the situation \"exceptional,\" describing gymnasiums that housed hundreds of inmates and toilets shared by upward of fifty people.\n\nLater that year, the state began implementing a law, signed by Brown, mandating that people convicted of certain low-level crimes be punished at the county level-by being put in county jails or on probation overseen by county officers, instead of into the state system of prison and parole. The plan was known as \"realignment.\" With that move, Brown came to the fore of efforts to reverse prison growth, decades after he'd played a key role in its expansion. It wasn't a sudden shift, however. In 2003, while Brown was serving as mayor of Oakland, he had publicly repented about the determinate-sentencing decision, calling it an \"abysmal failure\" and describing California's prisons as \"postgraduate schools of crime.\"\n\nBrown's policies are seen as largely responsible for lowering the total number of inmates in the state's prisons by about a fifth since 2011, to about a hundred and seventeen thousand people. Still, the law hasn't accomplished as much as Brown and other advocates had hoped it would. California prisons still house far more people than they were built for. In 2011, the Supreme Court mandated that the state heed a call from a three-judge court to bring its prison population down to close to a hundred and ten thousand people; the Supreme Court gave the state until 2013. But, now, the panel has been forced to give California an extension, to 2016, to get there.\n\nOn Tuesday, California voters went further still, passing a ballot measure, Proposition 47 , that will turn certain felonies that often result in state-prison sentences into misdemeanors, which are typically punished by lower-level sentences, such as time in county jail. The measure passed by a wide margin, with fifty-eight per cent in favor and forty-two per cent opposed. The development has been widely celebrated in criminal-justice circles and seen as a continuation of Californians' repudiation of the tough-on-crime age. \"There's a shift in the national consciousness,\" Allen Hopper, the criminal-justice and drug-policy director for the American Civil Liberties Union of California, told the Sacramento Bee . \"I think that 'smart on crime' sort of captures the mood of the nation now.\"\n\nThough this may be true, the outcome of Prop. 47's passage is uncertain. The measure's opponents had argued, for example, that the muted deterrence effect would lead to more crimes. This could well happen. But Hayley Munguia, of FiveThirtyEight.com, looked on Thursday at similar laws that have recently passed in other states-Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, and Texas-and found that, in three of the four states, crime rates had decreased afterward. Since California started enacting reforms, in 2011, its rate of violent crimes has fallen, too, from four hundred and thirty-nine per hundred thousand residents, in 2010, to under four hundred, in 2013. (This continued a general decline since 1992, when the rate hit a record of eleven hundred.)\n\nAlso uncertain is whether Prop. 47 will actually keep people out of prison, let alone lower California's prison population enough to the level mandated by the judges. The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office, which advises the state legislature, estimated before the measure's passage that it would reduce the state prison population by \" several thousand \" inmates, but it didn't offer a more specific figure.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that California is making poor decisions-only that the outcomes won't be known for quite a while. That's to be expected with big legislative changes meant to reverse decades' worth of public policy. Discussing the realignment law, Brown recently made a remark that was eerily similar to his 1976 comment about determinate sentencing, calling the new law \"the biggest change, probably, in our prison system in the last forty years.\" Both times, Brown was prescient in recognizing that an important transformation was afoot; the hope is that this time it's for the better.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "White Like Me\n\nIn 1982, an investment banker named Richard Grand-Jean took a summer's lease on an eighteenth-century farmhouse in Fairfield, Connecticut; its owner, Anatole Broyard, spent his summers in Martha's Vineyard. The house was handsomely furnished with period antiques, and the surrounding acreage included a swimming pool and a pond. But the property had another attraction, too. Grand-Jean, a managing director of Salomon Brothers, was an avid reader, and he took satisfaction in renting from so illustrious a figure. Anatole Broyard had by then been a daily book reviewer for the Times for more than a decade, and that meant that he was one of literary America's foremost gatekeepers. Grand-Jean might turn to the business pages of the Times first, out of professional obligation, but he turned to the book page next, out of a sense of self. In his Walter Mittyish moments, he sometimes imagined what it might be like to be someone who read and wrote about books for a living-someone to whom millions of readers looked for guidance.\n\nBroyard's columns were suffused with both worldliness and high culture. Wry, mandarin, even self-amused at times, he wrote like a man about town, but one who just happened to have all of Western literature at his fingertips. Always, he radiated an air of soigné self-confidence: he could be amiable in his opinions or waspish, but he never betrayed a flicker of doubt about what he thought. This was a man who knew that his judgment would never falter and his sentences never fail him.\n\nGrand-Jean knew little about Broyard's earlier career, but as he rummaged through Broyard's bookshelves he came across old copies of intellectual journals like Partisan Review and Commentary , to which Broyard had contributed a few pieces in the late forties and early fifties. One day, Grand-Jean found himself leafing through a magazine that contained an early article by Broyard. What caught his eye, though, was the contributor's note for the article-or, rather, its absence. It had been neatly cut out, as if with a razor.\n\nA few years later, Grand-Jean happened on another copy of that magazine, and decided to look up the Broyard article again. This time, the note on the contributor was intact. It offered a few humdrum details-that Broyard was born in New Orleans, attended Brooklyn College and the New School for Social Research, and taught at New York University's Division of General Education. It also offered a less humdrum one: the situation of the American Negro, the note asserted, was a subject that the author \"knows at first hand.\" It was an elliptical formulation, to be sure, but for Anatole Broyard it may not have been elliptical enough.\n\nBroyard was born black and became white, and his story is compounded of equal parts pragmatism and principle. He knew that the world was filled with such snippets and scraps of paper, all conspiring to reduce him to an identity that other people had invented and he had no say in. Broyard responded with X-Acto knives and evasions, with distance and denials and half denials and cunning half-truths. Over the years, he became a virtuoso of ambiguity and equivocation. Some of his acquaintances knew the truth; many more had heard rumors about \"distant\" black ancestry (wasn't there a grandfather who was black? a great-grandfather?). But most were entirely unaware, and that was as he preferred it. He kept the truth even from his own children. Society had decreed race to be a matter of natural law, but he wanted race to be an elective affinity, and it was never going to be a fair fight. A penalty was exacted. He shed a past and an identity to become a writer-a writer who wrote endlessly about the act of shedding a past and an identity.\n\nAnatole Paul Broyard was born on July 16, 1920, in New Orleans to Paul Broyard and Edna Miller. His father was a carpenter and worked as a builder, along with his brothers; neither parent had graduated from elementary school. Anatole spent his early years in a modest house on St. Ann Street, in a colored neighborhood in the French Quarter. Documents in the Louisiana state archives show all Anatole's ancestors, on both sides, to have been Negroes, at least since the late eighteenth century. The rumor about a distant black ancestor was, in a sense, the reverse of the truth: he may have had one distant white ancestor. Of course, the conventions of color stratification within black America-nowhere more pronounced than in New Orleans-meant that light-skinned blacks often intermarried with other light-skinned blacks, and this was the case with Paul and his \"high yellow\" wife, Edna. Anatole was the second of three children; he and his sister Lorraine, two years older, were light-skinned, while Shirley, two years younger, was not so light-skinned. (The inheritance of melanin is an uneven business.) In any event, the family was identified as Negro, and identified itself as Negro. It was not the most interesting thing about them. But in America it was not a negligible social fact. The year before Anatole's birth, for example, close to a hundred blacks were lynched in the South and anti-black race riots claimed the lives of hundreds more.\n\nWhile Anatole was still a child, the family moved to the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, thus joining the great migration that took hundreds of thousands of Southern blacks to Northern cities during the twenties. In the French Quarter, Paul Broyard had been a legendary dancer, beau, and galant ; in the French Quarter, the Broyards-Paul was one of ten siblings-were known for their craftsmanship. Brooklyn was a less welcoming environment. \"He should never have left New Orleans, but my mother nagged him into it,\" Broyard recalled years later. Though Paul Broyard arrived there a master carpenter, he soon discovered that the carpenters' union was not favorably inclined toward colored applicants. A stranger in a strange city, Paul decided to pass as white in order to join the union and get work. It was strictly a professional decision, which affected his work and nothing else.\n\nFor Paul, being colored was a banal fact of life, which might be disguised when convenient; it was not a creed or something to take pride in. Paul did take pride in his craft, and he liked to boast of rescuing projects from know-nothing architects. He filled his home with furniture he had made himself-flawlessly professional, if a little too sturdily built to be stylish. He also took pride in his long legs and his dance-hall agility (an agility Anatole would share). It was a challenge to be a Brooklyn galant , but he did his best.\n\n\"Family life was very congenial, it was nice and warm and cozy, but we just didn't have any sort of cultural or intellectual nourishment at home,\" Shirley, who was the only member of the family to graduate from college, recalls. \"My parents had no idea even what the New York Times was, let alone being able to imagine that Anatole might write for it.\" She says, \"Anatole was different from the beginning.\" There was a sense, early on, that Anatole Broyard-or Buddy, as he was called then-was not entirely comfortable being a Broyard.\n\nShirley has a photograph, taken when Anatole was around four or five, of a family visit back to New Orleans. In it you can see Edna and her two daughters, and you can make out Anatole, down the street, facing in the opposite direction. The configuration was, Shirley says, pretty representative. After graduating from Boys High School, in the late thirties, he enrolled in Brooklyn College. Already, he had a passion for modern culture-for European cinema and European literature. The idea that meaning could operate on several levels seemed to appeal to him. Shirley recalls exasperating conversations along those lines: \"He'd ask me about a Kafka story I'd read or a French film I'd seen and say, 'Well, you see that on more than one level, don't you?' I felt like saying 'Oh, get off it.' Brothers don't say that to their sisters.\"\n\nJust after the war began, he got married, to a black Puerto Rican woman, Aida, and they soon had a daughter. (He named her Gala, after Salvador Dali's wife.) Shirley recalls, \"He got married and had a child on purpose-the purpose being to stay out of the Army. Then Anatole goes in the Army anyway, in spite of this child.\" And his wife and child moved in with the Broyard family.\n\nThough his military records were apparently destroyed in a fire, some people who knew him at this time say that he entered the segregated Army as a white man. If so, he must have relished the irony that after attending officers' training school he was made the captain of an all-black stevedore battalion. Even then, his thoughts were not far from the new life he envisioned for himself. He said that he joined the Army with a copy of Wallace Stevens in his back pocket; now he was sending money home to his wife and asking her to save it so that he could open a bookstore in the Village when he got back. \"She had other ideas,\" Shirley notes. \"She wanted him to get a nice job, nine to five.\"\n\nBetween Aida and the allure of a literary life there was not much competition. Soon after his discharge from the Army, at war's end, he found an apartment in the Village, and he took advantage of the G.I. Bill to attend evening classes at the New School for Social Research, on Twelfth Street. His new life had no room for Aida and Gala. (Aida, with the child, later moved to California and remarried.) He left other things behind, too. The black scholar and dramatist W. F. Lucas, who knew Buddy Broyard from Bed-Stuy, says, \"He was black when he got into the subway in Brooklyn, but as soon as he got out at West Fourth Street he became white.\"\n\nHe told his sister Lorraine that he had resolved to pass so that he could be a writer, rather than a Negro writer. His darker-skinned younger sister, Shirley, represented a possible snag, of course, but then he and Shirley had never been particularly close, and anyway she was busy with her own life and her own friends. (Shirley graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Hunter College, and went on to marry Franklin Williams, who helped organize the Peace Corps and served as Ambassador to Ghana.) They had drifted apart: it was just a matter of drifting farther apart. Besides, wasn't that why everybody came to New York-to run away from the confines of family, from places where people thought they knew who and what you were? Whose family wasn't in some way unsuitable? In a Times column in 1979 Broyard wrote, \"My mother and father were too folksy for me, too colorful. . . . Eventually, I ran away to Greenwich Village, where no one had been born of a mother and father, where the people I met had sprung from their own brows, or from the pages of a bad novel. . . . Orphans of the avant-garde, we outdistanced our history and our humanity.\" Like so much of what he wrote in this vein, it meant more than it said; like the modernist culture he loved, it had levels.\n\nIn the Village, where Broyard started a bookstore on Cornelia Street, the salient thing about him wasn't that he was black but that he was beautiful, charming, and erudite. In those days, the Village was crowded with ambitious and talented young writers and artists, and Broyard-known for calling men \"Sport\" and girls \"Slim\"-was never more at home. He could hang out at the San Remo bar with Dwight Macdonald and Delmore Schwartz, and with a younger set who yearned to be the next Macdonalds and the next Schwartzes. Vincent Livelli, a friend of Broyard's since Brooklyn College days, recalls, \"Everybody was so brilliant around us-we kept duelling with each other. But he was the guy that set the pace in the Village.\" His conversation sparkled-everybody said so. The sentences came out perfectly formed, festooned with the most apposite literary allusions. His high-beam charm could inspire worship but also resentment. Livelli says, \"Anatole had a sort of dancing attitude toward life-he'd dance away from you. He had people understand that he was brilliant and therefore you couldn't hold him if you weren't worthy of his attention.\"\n\nThe novelist and editor Gordon Lish says, \"Photographs don't suggest in any wise the enormous power he had in person. No part of him was ever for a moment at rest.\" He adds, \"I adored him as a man. I mean, he was really in a league with Neal Cassady as a kind of presence.\" But there was, he says, a fundamental difference between Broyard and Kerouac's inspiration and muse: \"Unlike Cassady, who was out of control, Anatole was exorbitantly in control. He was fastidious about managing things.\"\n\nExcept, perhaps, the sorts of things you're supposed to manage. His bookstore provided him with entrée to Village intellectuals-and them with entrée to Anatole-yet it was not run as a business, exactly. Its offerings were few but choice: Céline, Kafka, other hard-to-find translations. The critic Richard Gilman, who was one of its patrons, recalls that Broyard had a hard time parting with the inventory: \"He had these books on the shelf, and someone would want to buy one, and he would snatch it back.\"\n\nAround 1948, Broyard started to attract notice not merely for his charm, his looks, and his conversation but for his published writings. The early pieces, as often as not, were about a subject to which he had privileged access: blacks and black culture. Commentary , in his third appearance in its pages, dubbed him an \"anatomist of the Negro personality in a white world.\" But was he merely an anthropologist or was he a native informant? It wasn't an ambiguity that he was in any hurry to resolve. Still, if all criticism is a form of autobiography (as Oscar Wilde would have it), one might look to these pieces for clues to his preoccupations at the time. In a 1950 Commentary article entitled \"Portrait of the Inauthentic Negro,\" he wrote that the Negro's embarrassment over blackness should be banished by the realization that \"thousands of Negroes with 'typical' features are accepted as whites merely because of light complexion.\" He continued:\n\nThe inauthentic Negro is not only estranged from whites-he is also estranged from his own group and from himself. Since his companions are a mirror in which he sees himself as ugly, he must reject them; and since his own self is mainly a tension between an accusation and a denial, he can hardly find it, much less live in it. . . . He is adrift without a role in a world predicated on roles.\n\nA year later, in \"Keep Cool, Man: The Negro Rejection of Jazz,\" he wrote, just as despairingly, that the Negro's\n\ncontact with white society has opened new vistas, new ideals in his imagination, and these he defends by repression, freezing up against the desire to be white, to have normal social intercourse with whites, to behave like them. . . . But in coolness he evades the issue . . . he becomes a pacifist in the struggle between social groups-not a conscientious objector, but a draft-dodger.\n\nThese are words that could be read as self-indictment, if anybody chose to do so. Certainly they reveal a ticklish sense of the perplexities he found himself in, and a degree of self-interrogation (as opposed to self-examination) he seldom displayed again.\n\nIn 1950, in a bar near Sheridan Square, Broyard met Anne Bernays, a Barnard junior and the daughter of Edward L. Bernays, who is considered the father of public relations. \"There was this guy who was the handsomest man I have ever seen in my life, and I fell madly in love with him,\" Bernays, who is best known for such novels as \"Growing Up Rich\" and \"Professor Romeo,\" recalls. \"He was physically irresistible, and he had this dominating personality, and I guess I needed to be dominated. His hair was so short that you couldn't tell whether it was curly or straight. He had high cheekbones and very smooth skin.\" She knew that he was black, through a mutual friend, the poet and Blake scholar Milton Klonsky. (Years later, in a sort of epiphany, she recognized Anatole's loping walk as an African-American cultural style: \"It was almost as if this were inside him dying to get out and express itself, but he felt he couldn't do it.\")\n\nAfter graduation, she got a job as an editor at the literary semiannual Discovery . She persuaded Broyard to submit his work, and in 1954 the magazine ran a short story entitled \"What the Cystoscope Said\"-an extraordinary account of his father's terminal illness:\n\nI didn't recognize him at first, he was so bad. His mouth was open and his breathing was hungry. They had removed his false teeth, and his cheeks were so thin that his mouth looked like a keyhole. I leaned over his bed and brought my face before his eyes. \"Hello darlin',\" he whispered, and he smiled. His voice, faint as it was, was full of love, and it bristled the hairs on the nape of my neck and raised goose flesh on my forearms. I couldn't speak, so I kissed him. His cheek smelled like wax.\n\nOvernight, Broyard's renown was raised to a higher level. \"Broyard knocked people flat with 'What the Cystoscope Said,' \" Lish recalls. One of those people was Burt Britton, a bookseller who later co‐founded Books & Co. In the fifties, he says, he read the works of young American writers religiously: \"Now, if writing were a horse race, which God knows it's not, I would have gone out and put my two bucks down on Broyard.\" In \"Advertisements for Myself,\" Norman Mailer wrote that he'd buy a novel by Broyard the day it appeared. Indeed, Bernays recalls, on the basis of that story the Atlantic Monthly Press offered Broyard a twenty-thousand-dollar advance-then a staggeringly large sum for a literary work by an unknown-for a novel of which \"Cystoscope\" would be a chapter. \"The whole literary world was waiting with bated breath for this great novelist who was about to arrive,\" Michael Vincent Miller, a friend of Broyard's since the late fifties, recalls. \"Some feelings of expectation lasted for years.\"\n\nRumor surrounded Broyard like a gentle murmur, and sometimes it became a din. Being an orphan of the avant-garde was hard work. Among the black literati, certainly, his ancestry was a topic of speculation, and when a picture of Broyard accompanied a 1958 Time review of a Beat anthology it was closely scrutinized. Arna Bontemps wrote to Langston Hughes, \"His picture . . . makes him look Negroid. If so he is the only spade among the Beat Generation.\" Charlie Parker spied Broyard in Washington Square Park one day and told a companion, \"He's one of us, but he doesn't want to admit he's one of us.\" Richard Gilman recalls an awkwardness that ensued when he stumbled across Anatole with his dark-skinned wife and child: \"I just happened to come upon them in a restaurant that was not near our usual stomping grounds. He introduced me, and it was fine, but my sense was that he would rather not have had anyone he knew meet them.\" He adds, \"I remember thinking at the time that he had the look of an octoroon or a quadroon, one of those-which he strenuously denied. He got into very great disputes with people.\"\n\nOne of those disputes was with Chandler Brossard, who had been a close friend: Broyard was the best man at Brossard's wedding. There was a falling out, and Brossard produced an unflattering portrait of Broyard as the hustler and opportunist Henry Porter in his 1952 novel, \"Who Walk in Darkness.\" Brossard knew just where Broyard was most vulnerable, and he pushed hard. His novel originally began, \"People said Henry Porter was a Negro,\" and the version published in France still does. Apparently fearing legal action, however, Brossard's American publisher, New Directions, sent it to Broyard in galley form before it was published.\n\nAnne Bernays was with Broyard when the galleys arrived. Broyard explained to her, \"They asked me to read it because they are afraid I am going to sue.\" But why would he sue, she wanted to know. \"Because it says I'm a Negro,\" he replied grimly. \"Then,\" Bernays recalls, \"I said, 'What are you going to do?' He said, 'I am going to make them change it.' And he did.\"\n\nThe novel went on to be celebrated as a groundbreaking chronicle of Village hipsters; it also-as a result of the legal redactions-reads rather oddly in places. Henry Porter, the Broyard character, is rumored to be not a Negro but merely \"an illegitimate\":\n\nI suspect [the rumor] was supposed to explain the difference between the way he behaved and the way the rest of us behaved. Porter did not show that he knew people were talking about him this way. I must give him credit for maintaining a front of indifference that was really remarkable.\n\nSomeone both Porter and I knew quite well once told me the next time he saw Porter he was going to ask him if he was or was not an illegitimate. He said it was the only way to clear the air. Maybe so. But I said I would not think of doing it. . . . I felt that if Porter ever wanted the stories about himself cleared up, publicly, he would one day do so. I was willing to wait.\n\nAnd that, after all, is the nature of such secrets: they are not what cannot be known but what cannot be acknowledged.\n\nAnother trip wire seems to have landed Broyard in one of the masterpieces of twentieth-century American fiction, William Gaddis's \"The Recognitions.\" Livelli explains, \"Now, around 1947 or '48, William Gaddis and Anatole were in love with the same gal, Sheri Martinelli. They were rivals, almost at each other's throats. And Willie was such a sweetheart that he had a mild approach to everything, and Anatole was sort of a stabber: he injected words like poison into conversations.\" When \"The Recognitions\" came out, in 1955, \"Anatole caught on to it right away, and he was kind of angry over it.\" The Broyard character is named Max, and Gaddis wrote that he \"always looked the same, always the same age, his hair always the same short length,\" seemingly \"a parody on the moment, as his clothes caricatured a past at eastern colleges where he had never been.\" Worse is his \"unconscionable smile,\" which intimates \"that the wearer knew all of the dismal secrets of some evil jungle whence he had just come.\"\n\nBroyard's own account of these years-published in 1993 as \"Kafka Was the Rage\"-is fuelled by the intertwined themes of writing and women. Gaddis says, \"His eyes were these great pools-soft, gentle pools. It was girls, girls, girls: a kind of intoxication of its own. I always thought, frankly, that that's where his career went, his creative energies.\"\n\nAnne Bernays maintains, \"If you leave the sex part out, you're only telling half the story. With women, he was just like an alcoholic with booze.\" She stopped seeing him in 1952, at her therapist's urging. \"It was like going cold turkey off a drug,\" she says, remembering how crushing the experience was, and she adds, \"I think most women have an Anatole in their lives.\"\n\nIndeed, not a few of them had Anatole. \"He was a pussy gangster, really,\" Lucas, a former professor of comparative literature, says with Bed-Stuy bluntness. Gilman recalls being in Bergdorf Goodman and coming across Broyard putting the moves on a salesgirl. \"I hid behind a pillar-otherwise he'd know that I'd seen him-and watched him go through every stage of seduction: 'What do you think? Can I put this against you? Oh, it looks great against your skin. You have the most wonderful skin.' And then he quoted Baudelaire.\"\n\nQuoting Baudelaire turns out to be key. Broyard's great friend Ernest van den Haag recalls trolling the Village with Broyard in those days: \"We obviously quite often compared our modus operandi, and what I observed about Anatole is that when he liked a girl he could speak to her brilliantly about all kinds of things which the girl didn't in the least understand, because Anatole was really vastly erudite. The girl had no idea what he was talking about, but she loved it, because she was under the impression, rightly so, that she was listening to something very interesting and important. His was a solipsistic discourse, in some ways.\" Indeed, the narrator of \"What the Cystoscope Said\" tells of seducing his ailing father's young and ingenuous nurse in a similar manner:\n\n\"Listen,\" I said, borrowing a tone of urgency from another source, \"I want to give you a book. A book that was written for you, a book that belongs to you as much as your diary, that's dedicated to you like your nurse's certificate.\" . . . My apartment was four blocks away, so I bridged the distance with talk, raving about Journey to the End of the Night , the book she needed like she needed a hole in her head.\n\nBroyard recognized that seduction was a matter not only of talking but of listening, too, and he knew how to pay attention with an engulfing level of concentration. The writer Ellen Schwamm, who met Broyard in the late fifties, says, \"You show me a man who talks, and I'll show you a thousand women who hurl themselves at his feet. I don't mean just talk, I mean dialogues . He listened, and he was willing to speak of things that most men are not interested in: literature and its effect on life.\" But she also saw another side to Broyard's relentless need to seduce. She invokes a formulation made by her husband, the late Harold Brodkey: \"Harold used to say that a lot of men steal from women. They steal bits of their souls, bits of their personalities, to construct an emotional life, which many men don't have. And I think that Anatole needed something of that sort.\"\n\nIt's an image of self-assemblage which is very much in keeping with Broyard's own accounts of himself. Starting in 1946, and continuing at intervals for the rest of his life, he underwent analysis. Yet the word \"analysis\" is misleading: what he wanted was to be refashioned-or, as he told his first analyst, to be transfigured . \"When I came out with the word, I was like someone who sneezes into a handkerchief and finds it full of blood,\" he wrote in the 1993 memoir. \"I wanted to discuss my life with him not as a patient talking to an analyst but as if we were two literary critics discussing a novel. . . . I had a literature rather than a personality, a set of fictions about myself.\" He lived a lie because he didn't want to live a larger lie: and Anatole Broyard, Negro writer, was that larger lie.\n\nAlexandra Nelson, known as Sandy, met Broyard in January of 1961. Broyard was forty, teaching the odd course at the New School and supporting himself by freelancing: promotional copy for publishers, liner notes for Columbia jazz records, blurbs for the Book-of-the-Month Club. Sandy was twenty-three and a dancer, and Broyard had always loved dancers. Of Norwegian descent, she was strikingly beautiful, and strikingly intelligent. Michael Miller recalls, \"She represented a certain kind of blonde, a certain kind of sophisticated carnage and a way of moving through the world with a sense of the good things. They both had marvellous taste.\"\n\nIt was as if a sorcerer had made a list of everything Broyard loved and had given it life. At long last, the conqueror was conquered: in less than a year, Broyard and Sandy were married. Sandy remembers his aura in those days: \"Anatole was very hip. It wasn't a pose-it was in his sinew, in his bones. And, when he was talking to you, you just felt that you were receiving all this radiance from him.\" (Van den Haag says, \"I do think it's not without significance that Anatole married a blonde, and about as white as you can get. He may have feared a little bit that the children might turn out black. He must have been pleased that they didn't.\")\n\nWhile they were still dating, two of Broyard's friends told Sandy that he was black, in what seemed to be a clumsy attempt to scare her off. \"I think they really weren't happy to lose him, to see him get into a serious relationship,\" she says. \"They were losing a playmate, in a way.\" Whatever the cultural sanctions, she was unfazed. But she says that when she asked Broyard about it he proved evasive: \"He claimed that he wasn't black, but he talked about 'island influences,' or said that he had a grandmother who used to live in a tree on some island in the Caribbean. Anatole was like that-he was very slippery.\" Sandy didn't force the issue, and the succeeding years only fortified his sense of reserve. \"Anatole was very strong,\" she says. \"And he said about certain things, 'Just keep out. This is the deal if you get mixed up with me.' \" The life that Broyard chose to live meant that the children did not meet their Aunt Shirley until after his death-nor, except for a couple of brief visits in the sixties, was there any contact even with Broyard's light-skinned mother and older sister. It was a matter of respecting the ground rules. \"I would try to poke in those areas, but the message was very direct and strong,\" Sandy explains. \"Oh, when I got angry at him, you know, one always pushes the tender points. But over time you grow up about these things and realize you do what you can do and there are certain things you can't.\"\n\nIn 1963, just before their first child, Todd, was born, Anatole shocked his friends by another big move-to Connecticut. Not only was he moving to Connecticut but he was going to be commuting to work: for the first time in his life, he would be a company man. \"I think one of his claims to fame was that he hadn't had an office job-somehow, he'd escaped that,\" Sandy says. \"There had been no real need for him to grow up.\" But after Todd was born-a daughter, Bliss, followed in 1966-Anatole spent seven years working full-time as a copywriter at the Manhattan advertising agency Wunderman Ricotta & Kline.\n\nOver the next quarter century, the family lived in a series of eighteenth-century houses, sometimes bought on impulse, in places like Fairfield, Redding, Greens Farms, and Southport. Here, in a land of leaf-blowers and lawnmowers, Bed-Stuy must have seemed almost comically remote. Many of Broyard's intimates from the late forties knew about his family; the intimates he acquired in the sixties did not, or else had heard only rumors. Each year, the number of people who knew Buddy from Bed-Stuy dwindled; each year, the rumors grew more nebulous; each year, he left his past further behind. Miller says, \"Anatole was a master at what Erving Goffman calls 'impression management.' \" The writer Evelyn Toynton says, \"I remember once going to a party with Sandy and him in Connecticut. There were these rather dull people there, stockbrokers and the usual sorts of people, and Anatole just knocked himself out to charm every single person in the room. I said to him, 'Anatole, can't you ever not be charming?' \" Miller observes, \"He was a wonderful host. He could take people from different walks of life-the president of Stanley Tools or a vice-president of Merrill Lynch, say, and some bohemian type from the Village-and keep the whole scene flowing beautifully. He had perfect pitch for the social encounter, like Jay Gatsby.\"\n\nIt was as if, wedded to an ideal of American self-fashioning, he sought to put himself to the ultimate test. It was one thing to be accepted in the Village, amid the Beats and hipsters and émigrés, but to gain acceptance in Cheever territory was an achievement of a higher order. \"Anatole, when he left the Village and went to Connecticut, was able not only to pass but even to be a kind of influential presence in that world of rich white Wasps,\" Miller says. \"Maybe that was a shallower part of the passing-to be accepted by Connecticut gentry.\"\n\nBroyard's feat raised eyebrows among some of his literary admirers: something borrowed, something new. Daphne Merkin, another longtime friend, detected \"a 'country-squire' tendency-a complicated tendency to want to establish a sort of safety through bourgeoisness. It was like a Galsworthy quality.\"\n\nEven in Arcadia, however, there could be no relaxation of vigilance: in his most intimate relationships, there were guardrails. Broyard once wrote that Michael Miller was one of the people he liked best in the world, and Miller is candid about Broyard's profound influence on him. Today, Miller is a psychotherapist, based in Cambridge, and the author, most recently, of \"Intimate Terrorism.\" From the time they met until his death, Broyard read to him the first draft of almost every piece he wrote. Yet a thirty-year friendship of unusual intimacy was circumscribed by a subject that they never discussed. \"First of all, I didn't know ,\" Miller says. \"I just had intuitions and had heard intimations. It was some years before I'd even put together some intuition and little rumblings-nothing ever emerged clearly. There was a certain tacit understanding between us to accept certain pathways as our best selves, and not challenge that too much.\" It was perhaps, he says a little sadly, a limitation on the relationship.\n\nIn the late sixties, Broyard wrote several front-page reviews for the Times Book Review . \"They were brilliant, absolutely sensational,\" the novelist Charles Simmons, who was then an assistant editor there, says. In 1971, the Times was casting about for a new daily reviewer, and Simmons was among those who suggested Anatole Broyard. It wasn't a tough sell. Arthur Gelb, at the time the paper's cultural editor, recalls, \"Anatole was among the first critics I brought to the paper. He was very funny, and he also had that special knack for penetrating hypocrisy. I don't think he was capable of uttering a boring sentence.\"\n\nYou could say that his arrival was a sign of the times. Imagine: Anatole Broyard, downtown flaneur and apostle of sex and high modernism, ensconced in what was, literarily speaking, the ultimate establishment perch. \"There had been an awful lot of very tame, very conventional people at the Times , and Broyard came in as a sort of ambassador from the Village and Village sophistication,\" Alfred Kazin recalls. Broyard had a highly developed appreciation of the paper's institutional power, and he even managed to use it to avenge wrongs done him in his Village days. Just before he started his job at the daily, he published a review in the Times Book Review of a new novel by one Chandler Brossard. The review began, \"Here's a book so transcendently bad it makes us fear not only for the condition of the novel in this country, but for the country itself.\"\n\nBroyard's reviews were published in alternation with those of Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, who has now been a daily reviewer at the Times for more than a quarter century, and who readily admits that Broyard's appointment did not gladden his heart. They hadn't got along particularly well when Lehmann-Haupt was an editor at the Times Book Review , nor did Lehmann-Haupt entirely approve of Broyard's status as a fabled libertine. So when A. M. Rosenthal, the paper's managing editor, was considering hiring him, Lehmann-Haupt expressed reservations. He recalls, \"Rosenthal was saying, 'Give me five reasons why not.' And I thoughtlessly blurted out, 'Well, first of all, he is the biggest ass man in town.' And Rosenthal rose up from his desk and said, 'If that were a disqualification for working for the New York Times' -and he waved-'this place would be empty!' \"\n\nBroyard got off to an impressive start. Lehmann-Haupt says, \"He had a wonderful way of setting a tone, and a wonderful way of talking himself through a review. He had good, tough instincts when it came to fiction. He had taste.\" And the jovial Herbert Mitgang, who served a stint as a daily reviewer himself, says, \"I always thought he was the most literary of the reviewers. There would be something like a little essay in his daily reviews.\"\n\nOccasionally, his acerbic opinions got him in trouble. There was, for example, the storm that attended an uncharitable review of a novel by Christy Brown, an Irish writer who was born with severe cerebral palsy. The review concluded:\n\nIt is unfortunate that the author of \"A Shadow on Summer\" is an almost total spastic-he is said to have typed his highly regarded first novel, \"Down All the Days,\" with his left foot-but I don't see how the badness of his second novel can be blamed on that. Any man who can learn to type with his left foot can learn to write better than he has here.\n\nThen, there was the controversial review of James Baldwin's piously sentimental novel of black suffering, \"If Beale Street Could Talk.\" Broyard wrote:\n\nIf I have to read one more description of the garbage piled up in the streets of Harlem, I may just throw protocol to the winds and ask whose garbage is it? I would like to remind Mr. Baldwin that the City Health Code stipulates that garbage must be put out in proper containers, not indiscriminately \"piled.\"\n\nNo one could accuse Broyard of proselytizing for progressive causes. Jason Epstein, for one, was quick to detect a neoconservative air in his reviews, and Broyard's old friend Ernest van den Haag, a longtime contributing editor at National Review , volunteers that he was available to set Broyard straight on the issues when the need arose. Broyard could be mischievous, and he could be tendentious. It did not escape notice that he was consistently hostile to feminist writers. \"Perhaps it's naïve of me to expect people to write reasonable books about emotionally charged subjects,\" one such review began, irritably. \"But when you have to read and review two or three books each week, you do get tired of 'understanding' so much personal bias. You reach a point where it no longer matters that the author's mistakes are well meant. You don't care that he or she is on the side of the angels: you just want them to tell the truth.\"\n\nNor did relations between the two daily reviewers ever become altogether cordial. Lehmann-Haupt tells of a time in 1974 when Broyard said that he was sick and couldn't deliver a review. Lehmann-Haupt had to write an extra review in less than a day, so that he could get to the Ali-Frazier fight the next night, where he had ringside seats. Later, when they discussed the match, Broyard seemed suspiciously knowledgeable about its particulars; he claimed that a friend of his had been invited by a television executive to watch it on closed-circuit TV. \"I waited about six months, because one of the charming things about Anatole was that he never remembered his lies,\" Lehmann-Haupt says, laughing. \"And I said, 'Did you see that fight?' And he said, 'Oh, yeah-I was there as a guest of this television executive.' That's why he couldn't write the review!\"\n\nBroyard had been teaching off and on at the New School since the late fifties, and now his reputation as a writing teacher began to soar. Certainly his fluent prose style, with its combination of grace and clarity, was a considerable recommendation. He was charismatic and magisterial, and, because he was sometimes brutal about students' work, they found it all the more gratifying when he was complimentary. Among his students were Paul Breslow, Robert Olen Butler, Daphne Merkin, and Hilma Wolitzer. Ellen Schwamm, who took a workshop with him in the early seventies, says, \"He had a gourmet's taste for literature and for language, and he was really able to convey that: it was a very sensual experience.\"\n\nThese were years of heady success and, at the same time, of a rising sense of failure. An arbiter of American writing, Broyard was racked by his inability to write his own magnum opus. In the fifties, the Atlantic Monthly Press had contracted for an autobiographical novel-the novel that was supposed to secure Broyard's fame, his place in contemporary literature-but, all these years later, he had made no progress. It wasn't for lack of trying. Lehmann-Haupt recalls his taking a lengthy vacation in order to get the book written. \"I remember talking to him-he was up in Vermont, where somebody had lent him a house-and he was in agony. He banished himself from the Vineyard, was clearly suffering, and he just couldn't do it.\" John Updike, who knew Broyard slightly from the Vineyard, was reminded of the anticipation surrounding Ellison's second novel: \"The most famous non-book around was the one that Broyard was not writing.\" (The two non-book writers were in fact quite friendly: Broyard admired Ellison not only as a writer but as a dancer-a high tribute from such an adept as Broyard.)\n\nSurrounded by analysts and psychotherapists-Sandy Broyard had become a therapist herself by this time-Broyard had no shortage of explanations for his inability to write his book. \"He did have a total writer's block,\" van den Haag says, \"and he was analyzed by various persons, but it didn't fully overcome the writer's block. I couldn't prevent him from going back to 'The Cystoscope' and trying to improve it. He made it, of course, not better but worse.\" Broyard's fluency as an essayist and a reviewer wasn't quite compensation. Charles Simmons says, \"He had produced all this charming criticism, but the one thing that mattered to him was the one thing he hadn't managed to do.\"\n\nAs the seventies wore on, Miller discussed the matter of blockage with his best friend in relatively abstract terms: he suggested that there might be something in Broyard's relationship to his family background that was holding him back. In the eighties, he referred Broyard to his own chief mentor in gestalt therapy, Isador From, and From became perhaps Broyard's most important therapist in his later years. \"In gestalt therapy, we talk a lot about 'unfinished business': anything that's incomplete, unfinished, haunts the whole personality and tends, at some level, to create inhibition or blockage,\" Miller says. \"You're stuck there at a certain point. It's like living with a partly full bladder all your life.\"\n\nSome people speculated that the reason Broyard couldn't write his novel was that he was living it-that race loomed larger in his life because it was unacknowledged, that he couldn't put it behind him because he had put it beneath him. If he had been a different sort of writer, it might not have mattered so much. But Merkin points out, \"Anatole's subject, even in fiction, was essentially himself. I think that ultimately he would have had to deal with more than he wanted to deal with.\"\n\nBroyard may have been the picture of serene self-mastery, but there was one subject that could reliably fluster him. Gordon Lish recalls an occasion in the mid-seventies when Burt Britton (who was married to a black woman) alluded to Anatole's racial ancestry. Lish says, \"Anatole became inflamed, and he left the room. He snapped, like a dog snapping-he barked at Britton. It was an ugly moment.\" To people who knew nothing about the matter, Broyard's sensitivities were at times simply perplexing. The critic Judith Dunford used to go to lunch with Broyard in the eighties. One day, Broyard mentioned his sister Shirley, and Dunford, idly making conversation, asked him what she looked like. Suddenly, she saw an extremely worried expression on his face. Very carefully, he replied, \"Darker than me.\"\n\nThere was, finally, no sanctuary. \"When the children were older, I began, every eighteen months or so, to bring up the issue of how they needed to know at some point,\" Sandy Broyard says. \"And then he would totally shut down and go into a rage. He'd say that at some point he would tell them, but he would not tell them now.\" He was the Scheherazade of racial imposture, seeking and securing one deferral after another. It must have made things not easier but harder. In the modern era, children are supposed to come out to their parents: it works better that way around. For children, we know, can judge their parents harshly-above all, for what they understand as failures of candor. His children would see the world in terms of authenticity; he saw the world in terms of self-creation. Would they think that he had made a Faustian bargain? Would they speculate about what else he had not told them-about the limits of self-invention? Broyard's resistance is not hard to fathom. He must have wondered when the past would learn its place, and stay past.\n\nAnatole Broyard had confessed enough in his time to know that confession did nothing for the soul. He preferred to communicate his truths on higher frequencies. As if in exorcism, Broyard's personal essays deal regularly with the necessary, guilt-ridden endeavor of escaping family history: and yet the feelings involved are well-nigh universal. The thematic elements of passing-fragmentation, alienation, liminality, self-fashioning-echo the great themes of modernism. As a result, he could prepare the way for exposure without ever risking it. Miller observes, \"If you look at the writing closely enough, and listen to the intonations, there's something there that is like no writer from the completely white world. Freud talked about the repetition compulsion. With Anatole, it's interesting that he was constantly hiding it and in some ways constantly revealing it.\"\n\nSandy speaks of these matters in calmly analytic tones; perhaps because she is a therapist, her love is tempered by an almost professional dispassion. She says, \"I think his own personal history continued to be painful to him,\" and she adds, \"In passing, you cause your family great anguish, but I also think, conversely, do we look at the anguish it causes the person who is passing? Or the anguish that it was born out of?\"\n\nIt may be tempting to describe Broyard's self-positioning as arising from a tortured allegiance to some liberal-humanist creed. In fact, the liberal pieties of the day were not much to his taste. \"It wasn't about an ideal of racelessness but something much more complex and interesting,\" Miller says. \"He was actually quite anti-black,\" Evelyn Toynton says. She tells of a time when she was walking with him on a street in New York and a drunken black man came up to him and asked for a dollar. Broyard seethed. Afterward, he remarked to her, \"I look around New York, and I think to myself, If there were no blacks in New York, would it really be any loss?\"\n\nNo doubt this is a calculation that whites, even white liberals, sometimes find themselves idly working out: How many black muggers is one Thelonious Monk worth? How many Willie Hortons does Gwendolyn Brooks redeem? In 1970, Ellison published his classic essay \"What America Would Be Like Without Blacks,\" in Time ; and one reason it is a classic essay is that it addresses a question that lingers in the American political unconscious. Commanding as Ellison's arguments are, there remains a whit of defensiveness in the very exercise. It's a burdensome thing to refute a fantasy.\n\nAnd a burdensome thing to be privy to it. Ellen Schwamm recalls that one of the houses Broyard had in Connecticut had a black jockey on the lawn, and that \"he used to tell me that Jimmy Baldwin had said to him, 'I can't come and see you with this crap on your lawn.' \" (Sandy remembers the lawn jockey-an antique-as having come with the house; she also recalls that it was stolen one day.) Charles Simmons says that the writer Herbert Gold, before introducing him to Broyard, warned him that Broyard was prone to make comments about \"spades,\" and Broyard did make a few such comments. \"He personally, on a deeper level, was not enamored of blacks,\" van den Haag says. \"He avoided blacks. There is no question he did.\" Sandy is gingerly in alluding to this subject. \"He was very short-tempered with the behavior of black people, the sort of behavior that was shown in the news. He had paid the price to be at liberty to say things that, if you didn't know he was black, you would misunderstand. I think it made him ironical.\"\n\nEvery once in a while, however, Broyard's irony would slacken, and he would speak of the thing with an unaccustomed and halting forthrightness. Toynton says that after they'd known each other for several years he told her there was a \"C\" (actually, \"col,\" for \"colored\") on his birth certificate. \"And then another time he told me that his sister was black and that she was married to a black man.\" The circumlocutions are striking: not that he was black but that his birth certificate was; not that he was black but that his family was. Perhaps this was a matter less of evasiveness than of precision.\n\n\"Some shrink had said to him that the reason he didn't like brown-haired women or dark women was that he was afraid of his own shit,\" Toynton continues. \"And I said, 'Anatole, it's as plain as plain can be that it has to do with being black.' And he just stopped and said, 'You don't know what it was like. It was horrible.' He told me once that he didn't like to see his sisters, because they reminded him of his unhappy childhood.\" (Shirley's account suggests that this unhappy childhood may have had more to do with the child than with the hood.)\n\nEllen Schwamm remembers one occasion when Broyard visited her and Harold Brodkey at their apartment, and read them part of the memoir he was working on. She says that the passages seemed stilted and distant, and that Brodkey said to him, \"You're not telling the truth, and if you try to write lies or evade the truth this is what you get. What's the real story?\" She says, \"Anatole took a deep breath and said, 'The real story is that I'm not who I seem. I'm a black.' I said, 'Well, Anatole, it's no great shock, because this rumor has been around for years and years and years, and everyone assumes there's a small percentage of you that's black, if that's what you're trying to say.' And he said, 'No, that's not what I'm trying to say. My father could pass, but in fact my mother's black, too. We're black as far back as I know.' We never said a word of it to anybody, because he asked us not to.\"\n\nSchwamm also says that she begged him to write about his history: it seemed to her excellent material for a book. But he explained that he didn't want notoriety based on his race-on his revealing himself to be black-rather than on his talent. As Toynton puts it, Broyard felt that he had to make a choice between being an aesthete and being a Negro. \"He felt that once he said, 'I'm a Negro writer,' he would have to write about black issues, and Anatole was such an aesthete.\"\n\nAll the same, Schwamm was impressed by a paradox: the man wanted to be appreciated not for being black but for being a writer, even though his pretending not to be black was stopping him from writing. It was one of the very few ironies that Broyard, the master ironist, was ill equipped to appreciate.\n\nBesides, there was always his day job to attend to. Broyard might suffer through a midnight of the soul in Vermont; but he was also a working journalist, and when it came to filing his copy he nearly always met his deadlines. In the late seventies, he also began publishing brief personal essays in the Times . They are among the finest work he did-easeful, witty, perfectly poised between surface and depth. In them he perfected the feat of being self-revelatory without revealing anything. He wrote about his current life, in Connecticut: \"People in New York City have psychotherapists, and people in the suburbs have handymen. While anxiety in the city is existential, in the country it is structural.\" And he wrote about his earlier life, in the city: \"There was a kind of jazz in my father's movements, a rhythm compounded of economy and flourishes, functional and decorative. He had a blues song in his blood, a wistful jauntiness he brought with him from New Orleans.\" (Wistful, and even worrisome: \"I half-expected him to break into the Camel Walk, the Shimmy Shewobble, the Black Bottom or the Mess Around.\") In a 1979 essay he wrote about how much he dreaded family excursions:\n\nTo me, they were like a suicide pact. Didn't my parents know that the world was just waiting for a chance to come between us?\n\nInside, we were a family, but outside we were immigrants, bizarre in our differences. I thought that people stared at us, and my face grew hot. At any moment, I expected my father and mother to expose their tribal rites, their eccentric anthropology, to the gape of strangers.\n\nAnyone who saw me with my family knew too much about me.\n\nThese were the themes he returned to in many of his personal essays, seemingly marking out the threshold he would not cross. And if some of his colleagues at the Times knew too much about him, or had heard the rumors, they wouldn't have dreamed of saying anything. Abe Rosenthal (who did know about him) says that the subject never arose. \"What was there to talk about? I didn't really consider it my business. I didn't think it was proper or polite, nor did I want him to think I was prejudiced, or anything.\"\n\nBut most people knew nothing about it. C. Gerald Fraser, a reporter and an editor at the Times from 1967 until 1991, was friendly with Broyard's brother-in-law Ambassador Franklin Williams. Fraser, who is black, recalls that one day Williams asked him how many black journalists there were at the Times . \"I listed them,\" he says, \"and he said, 'You forgot one.' I went over the list again, and I said, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'Shirley's brother, Anatole Broyard.' I was dumbstruck, because I'd never heard it mentioned at the Times that he was black, or that the paper had a black critic.\"\n\nIn any event, Broyard's colleagues did not have to know what he was to have reservations about who he was. He cultivated his image as a trickster-someone who would bend the rules, finesse the system-and that image only intensified his detractors' ire. \"A good book review is an act of seduction, and when he did it there was nobody better,\" John Leonard says, but he feels that Broyard's best was not always offered. \"I considered him to be one of the laziest book reviewers to come down the pike.\" Soon a running joke was that Broyard would review only novels shorter than two hundred pages. In the introduction to \"Aroused by Books,\" a collection of the reviews he published in the early seventies, Broyard wrote that he tried to choose books for review that were \"closest to [his] feelings.\" Lehmann-Haupt says dryly, \"We began to suspect that he often picked the books according to the attractiveness of the young female novelists who had written them.\" Rosenthal had shamed him for voicing his disquiet about Broyard's reputation as a Don Juan, but before long Rosenthal himself changed his tune. \"Maybe five or six years later,\" Lehmann-Haupt recalls, \"Rosenthal comes up to me, jabbing me in the chest with a stiffened index finger and saying, 'The trouble with Broyard is that he writes with his cock!' I bit my tongue.\"\n\nGradually, a measure of discontent with Broyard's reviews began to make itself felt among the paper's cultural commissars. Harvey Shapiro, the editor of the Book Review from 1975 to 1983, recalls conversations with Rosenthal in which \"he would tell me that all his friends hated Anatole's essays, and I would tell him that all my friends loved Anatole's essays, and that would be the end of the conversation.\" In 1984, Broyard was removed from the daily Times and given a column in the Book Review .\n\nMitchel Levitas, the editor of the Book Review from 1983 to 1989, edited Broyard's column himself. He says, \"It was a tough time for him, you see, because he had come off the daily book review, where he was out there in the public eye twice a week. That was a major change in his public role.\" In addition to writing his column, he was put to work as an editor at the Book Review . The office environment was perhaps not altogether congenial to a man of his temperament. Kazin recalls, \"He complained to me constantly about being on the Book Review , because he had to check people's quotations and such. I think he thought that he was superior to the job.\"\n\nThen, too, it was an era in which the very notion of passing was beginning to seem less plangent than preposterous. Certainly Broyard's skittishness around the subject wasn't to everyone's liking. Brent Staples, who is black, was an editor at the Book Review at the time Broyard was there \"Anatole had it both ways,\" Staples says. \"He would give you a kind of burlesque wink that seemed to indicate he was ready to accept the fact of your knowing that he was a black person. It was a real ambiguity, tacit and sort of recessed. He jived around and played with it a lot, but never made it express the fact that he was black.\" It was a game that tried Staples' patience. \"When Anatole came anywhere near me, for example, his whole style, demeanor, and tone would change,\" he recalls. \"I took that as him conveying to me, 'Yes, I am like you. But I'm relating this to you on a kind of recondite channel.' Over all, it made me angry. Here was a guy who was, for a long period of time, probably one of the two or three most important critical voices on literature in the United States. How could you, actively or passively, have this fact hidden?\"\n\nStaples pauses, then says, \"You know, he turned it into a joke. And when you change something basic about yourself into a joke, it spreads, it metastasizes, and so his whole presentation of self became completely ironic. Everything about him was ironic.\"\n\nThere were some people who came to have a professional interest in achieving a measure of clarity on the topic. Not long before Broyard retired from the Times , in 1989, Daphne Merkin, as an editor at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, gave him an advance of a hundred thousand dollars for his memoirs. (The completed portion was ultimately published, as \"Kafka Was the Rage,\" by Crown.) Merkin learned that \"he was, in some ways, opaque to himself,\" and her disquiet grew when the early chapters arrived. \"I said, 'Anatole, there's something odd here. Within the memoir, you have your family moving to a black neighborhood in Brooklyn. I find that strange-unless they're black.' I said, 'You can do many things if you're writing a memoir. But if you squelch stuff that seems to be crucial about you, and pretend it doesn't exist . . .' \" She observes that he was much attached to aspects of his childhood, but \"in a clouded way.\"\n\nWhen Broyard retired from the Times , he was nearly sixty-nine. To Sandy, it was a source of some anguish that their children still did not know the truth about him. Yet what was that truth? Broyard was a critic-a critic who specialized in European and American fiction. And what was race but a European and American fiction? If he was passing for white, perhaps he understood that the alternative was passing for black. \"But if some people are light enough to live like white, mother, why should there be such a fuss?\" a girl asks her mother in \"Near-White,\" a 1931 story by the Harlem Renaissance author Claude McKay. \"Why should they live colored when they could be happier living white?\" Why, indeed? One could concede that the passing of Anatole Broyard involved dishonesty; but is it so very clear that the dishonesty was mostly Broyard's?\n\nTo pass is to sin against authenticity, and \"authenticity\" is among the founding lies of the modern age. The philosopher Charles Taylor summarizes its ideology thus: \"There is a certain way of being human that is my way. I am called upon to live my life in this way, and not in imitation of anyone else's life. But this notion gives a new importance to being true to myself. If I am not, I miss the point of my life; I miss what being human is for me .\" And the Romantic fallacy of authenticity is only compounded when it is collectivized: when the putative real me gives way to the real us. You can say that Anatole Broyard was (by any juridical reckoning) \"really\" a Negro, without conceding that a Negro is a thing you can really be. The vagaries of racial identity were increased by what anthropologists call the rule of \"hypodescent\"-the one-drop rule. When those of mixed ancestry-and the majority of blacks are of mixed ancestry-disappear into the white majority, they are traditionally accused of running from their \"blackness.\" Yet why isn't the alternative a matter of running from their \"whiteness\"? To emphasize these perversities, however, is a distraction from a larger perversity. You can't get race \"right\" by refining the boundary conditions.\n\nThe act of razoring out your contributor's note may be quixotic, but it is not mad. The mistake is to assume that birth certificates and biographical sketches and all the other documents generated by the modern bureaucratic state reveal an anterior truth-that they are merely signs of an independently existing identity. But in fact they constitute it. The social meaning of race is established by these identity papers-by tracts and treatises and certificates and pamphlets and all the other verbal artifacts that proclaim race to be real and, by that proclamation, make it so.\n\nSo here is a man who passed for white because he wanted to be a writer, and he did not want to be a Negro writer. It is a crass disjunction, but it is not his crassness or his disjunction. His perception was perfectly correct. He would have had to be a Negro writer, which was something he did not want to be. In his terms, he did not want to write about black love, black passion, black suffering, black joy; he wanted to write about love and passion and suffering and joy. We give lip service to the idea of the writer who happens to be black, but had anyone, in the postwar era, ever seen such a thing?\n\nBroyard's friend Richard A. Shweder, an anthropologist and a theorist of culture, says, \"I think he believed that reality is constituted by style,\" and ascribes to Broyard a \"deeply romantic view of the intimate connection between style and reality.\" Broyard passed not because he thought that race wasn't important but because he knew that it was. The durable social facts of race were beyond reason, and, like Paul Broyard's furniture, their strength came at the expense of style. Anatole Broyard lived in a world where race had, indeed, become a trope for indelibility, for permanence. \"All I have to do,\" a black folk saying has it, \"is stay black and die.\"\n\nBroyard was a connoisseur of the liminal-of crossing over and, in the familiar phrase, getting over. But the ideologies of modernity have a kicker, which is that they permit no exit. Racial recusal is a forlorn hope. In a system where whiteness is the default, racelessness is never a possibility. You cannot opt out; you can only opt in. In a scathing review of a now forgotten black author, Broyard announced that it was time to reconsider the assumption of many black writers that \" 'whitey' will never let you forget you're black.\" For his part, he wasn't taking any chances. At a certain point, he seems to have decided that all he had to do was stay white and die.\n\nIn 1989, Broyard resolved that he and his wife would change their life once more. With both their children grown, they could do what they pleased. And what they pleased-what he pleased, anyway-was to move to Cambridge, Massachusetts. They would be near Harvard, and so part of an intellectual community. He had a vision of walking through Harvard Square, bumping into people like the sociologist Daniel Bell, and having conversations about ideas in the street. Besides, his close friend Michael Miller was living in the area. Anne Bernays, also a Cambridge resident, says, \"I remember his calling several times and asking me about neighborhoods. It was important for him to get that right. I think he was a little disappointed when he moved that it wasn't to a fancy neighborhood like Brattle or Channing Street. He was on Wendell Street, where there's a tennis court across the street and an apartment building and the houses are fairly close together.\" It wasn't a matter of passing so much as of positioning.\n\nSandy says that they had another the-children-must-be-told conversation shortly before the move. \"We were driving to Michael's fiftieth-birthday party-I used to plan to bring up the subject in a place where he couldn't walk out. I brought it up then because at that point our son was out of college and our daughter had just graduated, and my feeling was that they just absolutely needed to know, as adults.\" She pauses. \"And we had words. He would just bring down this gate.\" Sandy surmises, again, that he may have wanted to protect them from what he had experienced as a child. \"Also,\" she says, \"I think he needed still to protect himself.\" The day after they moved into their house on Wendell Street, Broyard learned that he had prostate cancer, and that it was inoperable.\n\nBroyard spent much of the time before his death, fourteen months later, making a study of the literature of illness and death, and publishing a number of essays on the subject. Despite the occasion, they were imbued with an almost dandyish, even jokey sense of incongruity: \"My urologist, who is quite famous, wanted to cut off my testicles. . . . Speaking as a surgeon, he said that it was the surest, quickest, neatest solution. Too neat, I said, picturing myself with no balls. I knew that such a solution would depress me, and I was sure that depression is bad medicine.\" He had attracted notice in 1954 with the account of his father's death from a similar cancer; now he recharged his writing career as a chronicler of his own progress toward death. He thought about calling his collection of writings on the subject \"Critically Ill.\" It was a pun he delighted in.\n\nSoon after the diagnosis was made, he was told that he might have \"in the neighborhood of years.\" Eight months later, it became clear that this prognosis was too optimistic. Richard Shweder, the anthropologist, talks about a trip to France that he and his wife made with Anatole and Sandy not long before Anatole's death. One day, the two men were left alone. Shweder says, \"And what did he want to do? He wanted to throw a ball. The two of us just played catch, back and forth.\" The moment, he believes, captures Broyard's athleticism, his love of physical grace.\n\nBroyard spent the last five weeks of his life at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, in Boston. In therapy sessions, the need to set things straight before the end had come up again-the need to deal with unfinished business and, most of all, with his secret. He appeared willing, if reluctant, to do so. But by now he was in almost constant pain, and the two children lived in different places, so the opportunities to have the discussion as a family were limited. \"Anatole was in such physical pain that I don't think he had the wherewithal,\" Sandy says. \"So he missed the opportunity to tell the children himself.\" She speaks of the expense of spirit, of psychic energy, that would have been required. The challenge would have been to explain why it had remained a secret. And no doubt the old anxieties were not easily dispelled: would it have been condemned as a Faustian bargain or understood as a case of personality overspilling, or rebelling against, the reign of category?\n\nIt pains Sandy even now that the children never had the chance to have an open discussion with their father. In the event, she felt that they needed to know before he died, and, for the first time, she took it upon herself to declare what her husband could not. It was an early afternoon, ten days before his death, when she sat down with her two children on a patch of grass across the street from the institute. \"They knew there was a family secret, and they wanted to know what their father had to tell them. And I told them.\"\n\nThe stillness of the afternoon was undisturbed. She says carefully, \"Their first reaction was relief that it was only this, and not an event or circumstance of larger proportions. Only following their father's death did they begin to feel the loss of not having known. And of having to reformulate who it was that they understood their father-and themselves-to be.\"\n\nAt this stage of his illness, Anatole was moving in and out of lucidity, but in his room Sandy and the children talked with humor and irony about secrets and about this particular secret. Even if Anatole could not participate in the conversation, he could at least listen to it. \"The nurses said that hearing was the last sense to go,\" Sandy says.\n\nIt was not as she would have planned it. She says, gently, \"Anatole always found his own way through things.\"\n\nThe writer Leslie Garis, a friend of the Broyards' from Connecticut, was in Broyard's room during the last weekend of September, 1990, and recorded much of what he said on his last day of something like sentience. He weighed perhaps seventy pounds, she guessed, and she describes his jaundice-clouded eyes as having the permanently startled look born of emaciation. He was partly lucid, mostly not. There are glimpses of his usual wit, but in a mode more aleatoric than logical. He spoke of Robert Graves, of Sheri Martinelli, of John Hawkes interpreting Miles Davis. He told Sandy that he needed to find a place to go where he could \"protect his irony.\" As if, having been protected by irony throughout his life, it was now time to return the favor.\n\n\"I think friends are coming, so I think we ought to order some food,\" he announced hours before he lapsed into his final coma. \"We'll want cheese and crackers, and Faust.\"\n\n\"Faust?\" Sandy asked.\n\nAnatole explained, \"He's the kind of guy who makes the Faustian bargain, and who can be happy only when the thing is revealed.\"\n\nA memorial service, held at a Congregationalist church in Connecticut, featured august figures from literary New York, colleagues from the Times , and neighbors and friends from the Village and the Vineyard. Charles Simmons told me that he was surprised at how hard he took Broyard's death. \"You felt that you were going to have him forever, the way you feel about your own child,\" he said. \"There was something wrong about his dying, and that was the reason.\" Speaking of the memorial service, he says, marvelling, \"You think that you're the close friend, you know? And then I realized that there were twenty people ahead of me. And that his genius was for close friends.\"\n\nIndeed, six years after Broyard's death many of his friends seem to be still mourning his loss. For them he was plainly a vital principle, a dancer and romancer, a seducer of men and women. (He considered seduction, he wrote, \"the most heartfelt literature of the self.\") Sandy tells me, simply, \"You felt more alive in his presence,\" and I've heard almost precisely the same words from a great many others. They felt that he lived more intensely than other men. They loved him-perhaps his male friends especially, or, anyway, more volubly-and they admired him. They speak of a limber beauty, of agelessness, of a radiance. They also speak of his excesses and his penchant for poses. Perhaps, as the bard has it, Broyard was \"much more the better for being a little bad.\"\n\nAnd if his presence in American fiction was pretty much limited to other people's novels, that is no small tribute to his personal vibrancy. You find him reflected and refracted in the books of his peers, like Anne Bernays (she says there is a Broyard character in every novel she's written) and Brossard and Gaddis, of course, but also in those of his students. His own great gift was as a feuilletonist. The personal essays collected in \"Men, Women and Other Anticlimaxes\" can put you in mind of \"The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table,\" by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. They are brief impromptus, tonally flawless. To read them is to feel that you are in the company of someone who is thinking things through. The essays are often urbane and sophisticated, but not unbearably so, and they can be unexpectedly moving. Literary culture still fetishizes the novel, and there he was perhaps out of step with his times. Sandy says, \"In the seventies and eighties, the trend, in literature and film, was to get sparer, and the flourish of Anatole's voice was dependent on the luxuriance of his language.\" Richard Shweder says, \"It does seem that Anatole's strength was the brief, witty remark. It was aphoristic. It was the critical review. He was brilliant in a thousand or two thousand words.\" Perhaps he wasn't destined to be a novelist, but what of it? Broyard was a Negro who wanted to be something other than a Negro, a critic who wanted to be something other than a critic. Broyard, you might say, wanted to be something other than Broyard. He very nearly succeeded.\n\nShirley Broyard Williams came to his memorial service, and many of his friends-including Alfred Kazin, who delivered one of the eulogies-remember being puzzled and then astonished as they realized that Anatole Broyard was black. For Todd and Bliss, however, meeting Aunt Shirley was, at last, a flesh-and-blood confirmation of what they had been told. Shirley is sorry that they didn't meet sooner, and she remains baffled about her brother's decision. But she isn't bitter about it; her attitude is that she has had a full and eventful life of her own-husband, kids, friends-and that if her brother wanted to keep himself aloof she respected his decision. She describes the conversations they had when they did speak: \"They always had to be focussed on something, like a movie, because you couldn't afford to be very intimate. There had to be something that would get in the way of the intimacy.\" And when she phoned him during his illness it was the same way. \"He never gave that up,\" she says, sounding more wistful than reproachful. \"He never learned how to be comfortable with me.\" So it has been a trying set of circumstances all around. \"The hypocrisy that surrounds this issue is so thick you could chew it,\" Shirley says wearily.\n\nShirley's husband died several months before Anatole, and I think she must have found it cheering to be able to meet family members who had been sequestered from her. She says that she wants to get to know her nephew and her niece-that there's a lot of time to make up. \"I've been encouraging Bliss to come and talk, and we had lunch, and she calls me on the phone. She's really responded very well. Considering that it's sort of last-minute.\"\n\nYears earlier, in an essay entitled \"Growing Up Irrational,\" Anatole Broyard wrote, \"I descended from my mother and father. I was extracted from them.\" His parents were \"a conspiracy, a plot against society,\" as he saw it, but also a source of profound embarrassment. \"Like every great tradition, my family had to die before I could understand how much I missed them and what they meant to me. When they went into the flames at the crematorium, all my letters of introduction went with them.\" Now that he had a wife and family of his own, he had started to worry about whether his children's feelings about him would reprise his feelings about his parents: \"Am I an embarrassment to them, or an accepted part of the human comedy? Have they joined my conspiracy, or are they just pretending? Do they understand that, after all those years of running away from home, I am still trying to get back?\" ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Mike White's Mischievous Vision for \"The White Lotus\"\n\nMike White's first job as a television writer, in the late nineties, was on the teen soap opera \" Dawson's Creek .\" It was a sentimental show, leavened by sharp, self-conscious dialogue; the titular character, Dawson Leery, was a film buff who worked at a video store, which meant that he could analyze the show's various narrative devices at least as well as viewers could. One of White's main tasks was to prolong the sense of romantic anticipation that sustained the show, and for a time he enjoyed solving this puzzle. But it didn't last. \"I quickly couldn't keep interested,\" he said recently. \"I always, whether intentionally or not, started burning down the house.\"\n\nIt was a sticky spring afternoon in Phuket, Thailand, and White had summoned a few dozen actors and a few hundred crew members from around the world to shoot the third season of \"The White Lotus,\" his acclaimed HBO series. The show, which began as a rushed pandemic project in Hawaii, has expanded into a globe-trotting franchise, with a new setting and array of characters for each incarnation. \"This is, like, my dream gig,\" White said. \"Because I can burn down the house at the end of every season and start building again.\"\n\nThe 100th Anniversary Issue Subscribers get full access. Read the issue »\n\nWhite is fifty-four, with pale skin, pale hair, and a nasal, hesitating voice that disguises an implacable determination to do things precisely the way he wants. For most of his career, he was known for what he calls \"oddball character studies\"-projects that were cerebral and a little weird. He wrote and starred in \"Chuck & Buck,\" an indie movie that drew a small crowd but left a big impression: Entertainment Weekly named it the year's best film, and Roger Ebert called it \"a fascinating study of behavior that violates the rules,\" although his reviewing partner, Richard Roeper, likened the film to \"spiders crawling on my arms.\" White found broad success when he wrote \"School of Rock,\" the Jack Black movie, which inspired a children's television show and a Broadway musical. His first HBO drama, \"Enlightened,\" delighted a narrower audience . In the show, Laura Dern played Amy Jellicoe, who was an inspiring crusader and a painful nightmare, sometimes in the same scene. It ran for two seasons before it was cancelled.\n\nWhite specializes in characters who leave viewers unsure of how to feel about them, or about themselves. With \"The White Lotus,\" though, he has found a way to provide plenty of pleasure along with the pain. The show is both a social satire and a murder mystery, named for the fictional luxury hotel chain where it is set. People go to the White Lotus to be pampered, which means that the audience can feel pampered, too, watching glamorous characters talking through various trivial and existential crises. Each season begins with an unidentified corpse, giving viewers assurance that, by season's end, a question will be settled, even if their feelings about the characters aren't.\n\nThe first season, filmed at a Four Seasons in Maui and broadcast in 2021, was a barbed morality play about the ways that rich Americans make themselves at home in exotic locations. Unlike many pandemic-era projects, it felt bright and buoyant, earning an armful of awards and becoming HBO's most streamed show. White followed up by discarding much of what fans loved. The second season, which he describes as \"an Italian bedroom farce,\" was set in Sicily, and its characters and plot were more exuberant: if Hawaii gave White a chance to skewer American hypocrisy, Sicily gave him a chance to escape it. Now, for the third season, he was again asking fans to transfer their loyalty to an almost entirely new show.\n\nThough White finds these constant transformations enlivening, they put pressure on him: because the cast and the location and even the theme song keep changing, the show's identity is its semi-satirical tone-that is, White's tone. The new season begins with violent chaos; viewers expecting a comedy of manners get something that looks, instead, like an action movie. \"It's about death,\" White told me. \"But I also find it maybe the funniest season.\" The plot came to him on a location-scouting trip, when he was struck with bronchitis and given a steroid nebulizer; kept awake by the medicine, he found himself imagining a group of Westerners who descend on Thailand in search of spiritual revival.\n\nLink copied\n\nWe were sitting in an air-conditioned hotel suite with a dramatic view of Patong Bay, where a cruise ship was slowly turning, on its way from Perth to Mumbai. White seemed too distracted to notice. By creating a hit series about luxury hotels, he has consigned himself to a life of upscale travel, and he had been in Thailand, off and on, for more than a year. He said that the whole process made him feel a bit like a con man: he had dreamed up a story, and now he had to bring it profitably to life. \"I see myself as an indie weirdo who's just backed into this,\" he said. \"I'm white-knuckling my way through.\" Then he began to cry softly, which made him chuckle at his own sentimentality. (In a Mike White show, the sight of a director crying in front of a journalist would surely be presented as awkward comedy.) He said that he found it exhausting to be responsible for so many people-all those actors who had uprooted their lives and moved to Thailand-and that he wasn't used to the pressure of commercial expectations. Yet people who know him say that he has always believed in his own ability to tell a great story. \"Obviously, I don't want to lay an egg,\" he told me. \"But I don't think I'm going to.\"\n\nAs an actor, White has often portrayed nebbishes and sneaks, so people who meet him are sometimes surprised to encounter a fit, energetic man with a fondness for protein shakes. In Thailand, he was wearing gray running shorts and On Cloud sneakers, as well as a wristband that kept track of his heart-rate variability and sleep regimen. He told me that he wanted to make sure he was at his best during the long, hot shoot, though he conceded that this was also an act of benevolent manipulation: he wanted the cast and crew to function at their best, too. \"He's always asking me how many grams of protein I ate, or what's my H.R.V.,\" Patrick Schwarzenegger, one of the stars of the new season, said during a break between scenes. Schwarzenegger is the son of the legendary action star, and also a fitness obsessive: he co-founded a company that makes protein bars. He said he had grown used to encountering White in the hotel gym at five in the morning.\n\nBecause White is an exacting and perceptive person, he knows how infuriating exacting people can be. In the first season, Jake Lacy and Alexandra Daddario played a honeymooning couple: Shane, a rich heir, and Rachel, a frustrated journalist who is increasingly uncertain that she has, in fact, married well. Shane spends most of the six episodes engaged in a spiralling dispute with the hotel's disobliging manager over whether he has been given the suite he requested:\n\nR ACHEL : Why wouldn't he want us to have the room? Why would he care?\n\nS HANE : I bet because he thinks I'm an asshole.\n\nR ACHEL : Well, were you an asshole?\n\nS HANE : No! No, I was actually trying to not be an asshole.\n\nR ACHEL ( with a bright smile ): But-you failed?\n\nThe undisputed fan favorite from that season was Jennifer Coolidge , who played a wealthy, woozy solo traveller named Tanya; she never seemed quite sure where she was or how she had got there. The role marked a career resurgence for Coolidge, and she was virtually the only actor who returned for Season 2. But she didn't make the trip to Thailand. \"I miss her a lot,\" White said, without seeming to doubt his decision. Later, when I talked to Coolidge, she said, graciously, that she understood that her departure was a dramatic necessity: \"I don't think Tanya's ever coming back, so I have to live with it.\"\n\nThis year's cast includes Parker Posey , playing an ostentatious matriarch with a toothsome Southern drawl. One afternoon during shooting, she was sitting at a table in the hotel restaurant, wearing a peach-colored cotton dress, swatting at the air, and singing a quiet song of her own invention: \"Bug spray, bug spray, bug spra-a-a-ay.\" White approached her to confer, and they traded requests: she asked him to scratch a spot on her back, and he asked her to angle slightly toward the camera. The scene also involved her character's daughter, played with eye-rolling disdain by Sarah Catherine Hook, and the daughter's father, who was evidently in some kind of trouble. Posey's character wanted her daughter to understand that the dad, played by Jason Isaacs, really wasn't so bad. He had his flaws, but he wasn't some sort of lowlife or sexual predator. \"You think men like that only exist in bad movies,\" Posey said. \"Turns out? They're real.\" White ducked in with a suggestion: perhaps Posey could say \"They're real\" with rising intonation, as a verbal shrug?\n\nWhite thinks of himself primarily as a writer, which means that he can't help being attuned to the minutiae of the script. But actors he has worked with say that they think of him as a fellow-practitioner. At one point, he told Isaacs, \"Hide it better.\" He wanted Isaacs to carry on a normal conversation, trusting that the camera would find his eyes and allow him to show, with a minimal gesture, that something was terribly wrong. Isaacs said that he had learned to trust White. \"He wants to shriek with laughter-sometimes at the most tragic things,\" he said. \"If you get a shriek from behind the monitor, you know two things. One, you've done something great. And, two, you might have to do it again, because he's ruined the sound.\"\n\nWhite's father, Mel, says that Mike was an unusually confident and clear-eyed boy. \"Michael has never been ambivalent about anything,\" he told me. When Mel tried to scold him, Mike would patiently pull him aside and say, \"Dad, take it easy.\" The family lived in Pasadena, and White got interested in theatre in the second grade, thanks to a teacher who happened to be Sam Shepard's mother. His own mother, Lyla, later worked as the executive director of the Pasadena Playhouse.\n\nWhite is a second-generation writer and director, but he could not fairly be described as a nepo baby. Mel White was for a time a leading storyteller in the evangelical movement. Starting in the early nineteen-seventies, he wrote a series of inspirational tracts, and then ghostwrote books for some of the movement's most prominent figures, including Pat Robertson (\"America's Dates with Destiny\") and Jerry Falwell (\"Strength for the Journey\"). He also helped direct documentaries for Francis Schaeffer, the influential theologian. Mike attended an exclusive day school in Pasadena, and on Sundays he went to a Congregationalist church to hear his father preach against materialism, sometimes arguing that Christians shouldn't even own homes. In the summer, he was sent to a Christian camp that held rapture drills. \"I felt like an outsider, but I didn't dress the part of a countercultural person,\" he said. \"It took a while to figure out what, exactly, I was counter to.\"\n\nDuring those years, Mel was struggling to quench his lifelong attraction to men. When Mike was around eleven, he stumbled on one of his father's journals and began to discover that his parents' marriage was more complicated than he had suspected. \"It was definitely a house of secrets,\" he remembers. In 1993, Mel publicly announced that he was gay, and the next year he published \" Stranger at the Gate: To Be Gay and Christian in America ,\" an affecting memoir that described his efforts to change, including electroconvulsive therapy; his decision to stop trying to change; and his disappointment that his former friends and allies, especially Robertson and Falwell, weren't willing to reconsider their beliefs about same-sex romance, or even talk with him about his life. On \"60 Minutes,\" Mel tried to explain why he had waited to publicly criticize people he so disagreed with. \"I was blinded by my love for Jesus, and my love for the Scripture, and my hopes for the Church,\" he said. \"And I was-yeah, I had two kids in college.\"\n\nWhite's older sister, Erinn, attended Azusa Pacific, and is now a teacher. White went to Wesleyan, where he became known as a writer of sharp dialogue. One of his T.A.s, Zak Penn, remembers a scene that he wrote depicting two women getting drunk in a bar. \"I was astonished that he had written something that well observed,\" Penn says: the women sounded like real people, talking about real lives.\n\nNot long afterward, Penn moved to Hollywood, and landed a hundred-and-sixty-thousand-dollar writing deal. (He had co-written the script that became \"Last Action Hero,\" starring Patrick Schwarzenegger's father.) He offered half the fee to White after he graduated. White was a hard worker, though not by nature a team player. Penn recalls, \"I said, 'I'll do the first fifteen pages, and you do the next fifteen.' That was a Friday, and on Monday he came in with forty pages written-all great.\"\n\nWhen a fellow Wesleyan graduate, Miguel Arteta, gave White and Penn small roles in an indie film he was making, \"Star Maps,\" White couldn't resist rewriting their few lines of dialogue. The two played smug screenwriters, and White thought that his character should respond to a director's suggestion about making a sex scene more political by saying, \"When they're fucking on her desk, she can knock over a recycling bin.\" Arteta wasn't offended-he was impressed. \"I was, like, 'Dear God, yes, please, let's shoot this,' \" he says.\n\nIt was the late nineties, and White was shopping some screenplays while taking TV-writing jobs. Arteta found himself preoccupied with one of White's scripts, \"Chuck & Buck,\" about a guy who can't let go of his boyhood best friend. Arteta asked White to let him direct, and White played Buck. In an era of twee indie films, Buck was defiantly uncharming-a \"lost, gay predator retard,\" as White once called him. Over the years, White has described himself as bisexual or gay, but he wanted to resist the neat logic of the coming-out story. \"My dad suffered a lot from wanting to appear good,\" he told me. \"It was so important for him to say, 'Gays are just like you, we're good little boys.' And 'Chuck & Buck' is me being, like, 'I don't want to be making that argument for my career, or my life. I'm not a good little boy.' \" White took his father to a screening, and remembers Mel grabbing his leg in feigned shock-or, perhaps, real shock-during some of the film's most uncomfortable moments, like Buck's desperate and manipulative pleas for sex. \"I thought, He's way ahead of me, in terms of dealing with issues you don't deal with publicly,\" Mel White told me. \"The first movie he made, and the star only wanted a blow job.\"\n\nOne of the film's fans was Jennifer Aniston , who agreed to play the lead in White and Arteta's next collaboration, \"The Good Girl,\" which starts out like a romantic comedy and then goes disastrously, absurdly wrong. Something similar happened to White's career a few years later, after he got an offer to create a sitcom for Fox. \"Cracking Up\" was about a young psychology student who moves into the guesthouse of a wealthy Beverly Hills family. As the tagline put it, \"Meet the all-American family-and the therapist crazy enough to live with them!\"\n\nFox had ambitious goals for the show-which was broadcast immediately after \"American Idol\"-and apparently that was part of the problem. Molly Shannon played the mother, who suffered from a frantic addiction to pills and alcohol. She says that the set was great fun until the network started thinking that viewers might prefer a show that was less unhinged. Shannon remembers a disagreement with executives over a scene in which her character tried to bust open a safe containing the family's alcohol supply. \"It was such brilliant writing, and just a joy-but then they started giving these notes that were not good,\" she says. \"And, really, Mike was getting stressed out.\"\n\nAs a writer, White could appreciate the irony: under the pressure of trying to manage a show called \"Cracking Up,\" he was cracking up. He wrote a letter to Fox, insulting the executives and all but daring them to cancel. Eventually, he found himself so paralyzed by stress that he thought he might be having a nervous breakdown, and briefly visited Las Encinas, a Pasadena psychiatric hospital. In the end, he turned to Buddhist self-help books, even as he cringed at the idea of a burned-out Hollywood writer doing self-actualization exercises. \"You see it as the absurdity that it is,\" he said. \"But then, the next minute, you're kind of still drinking the Kool-Aid.\"\n\nOne of White's favorite tactics is to give a character a speech that's both serious and funny-not wholly convincing but not wholly inane. For a time, in the early nineties, he lived next door to Jack Black , and he wrote \"School of Rock\" with him in mind. (More than once, White has surprised a prospective collaborator with a script that no one knew he was working on.) Black, who was then establishing himself as a good-natured but anarchic film star, was amazed at how well the screenplay captured his vibe. \"That's my tombstone role, for sure,\" he told me.\n\nEarly in the movie, Black's character, Dewey, a hapless rocker who fakes his way into a gig as a substitute teacher, tells a roomful of students that the world is rigged against them:\n\nThe Man ruined the ozone, and he's burning down the Amazon, and he kidnapped Shamu and put her in a chlorine tank, O.K.? And there used to be a way to stick it to the Man: it was called rock and roll. But guess what? Oh, no, the Man ruined that, too, with a little thing called MTV. So don't waste your time trying to make anything cool, or pure, or awesome, 'cause the Man's just gonna call you a fat, washed-up loser and crush your soul. So do yourselves a favor and just give up!\n\nBlack's bug-eyed charisma makes this pathetic sermon seem halfway convincing, and gives viewers a moment to calibrate their opinion of Dewey. (Would you entrust your child to this man?) \"School of Rock\" is basically a wholesome family film, but it delivers a complicated message: even a flawed doctrine can be compelling, and transformative. This, perhaps, is a lesson that White learned as a boy, sitting next to the pulpit when his father was preaching. And perhaps he learned it again at Wesleyan, where he wrote a thesis on Judith Butler and earnestly studied the scriptures of postmodern theory. \"Wesleyan was, like, the P.C. school, before institutions all became sort of like that, and I embraced the theology of that for a long time,\" he says. (The atmosphere there was intense enough to inspire the 1994 satire \"PCU,\" co-written by Zak Penn.)\n\nAttentive followers of White's career may find themselves anticipating the loopy gospels that his characters preach-and then, inevitably, fail to entirely practice. In \"Enlightened,\" the main character, Amy, is emerging from a breakdown and trying to put her newfound wisdom to use. The show opens with our hero sobbing in a bathroom stall. \"You look insane,\" a co-worker tells her, and the subsequent episodes complicate this judgment without quite refuting it. By the end of the second season, Amy is a crusader against corporate corruption-but also, still, an annoying and bottomlessly needy presence, as so many of us are, at least some of the time.\n\nAfter her breakdown, Amy goes to a retreat in Hawaii, and a voice-over narrates the words we see her writing in her journal:\n\nI'm speaking with my true voice now, without bitterness or fear, and I'm here to tell you: you can walk out of hell and into the light, you can wake up to your higher self. And, when you do, the world is suddenly full of possibility, of wonder and deep connection.\n\nLike much of what Amy says in the course of two seasons, this is ludicrous without necessarily being wrong. Part of what White loved about the character was that she wasn't cool-she had little in common with Tony Soprano , Walter White , Don Draper , or other manly television rogues. White says that HBO executives worried about the \"emo voice-overs\" that bookended many of the episodes, and the \"tonal ambivalence\" that has long been one of his favorite qualities. At one point, Amy's ex-husband goes on the Hawaiian retreat that she loved. He hates it. \"It's like I'm in a Hawaiian prison,\" he says. The episode was broadcast in 2013, the year that White bought a house in Hawaii-having decided, apparently, that Amy's notion of finding renewal in the middle of the Pacific Ocean wasn't so ridiculous after all.\n\nEven by Hawaiian standards, Kauai is a low-key place: quieter than Oahu and less opulent than Maui. White lives across the street from the ocean, and he has set up editing bays in several units of a time-share development nearby, an arrangement that suits both his temperament and the show's budget. (The state government offers a twenty-seven-per-cent tax credit for certain film-production work undertaken on Kauai.) I visited White there in early December. A few friends were in town, and his flatulent bulldog, Peanut, was following him loyally wherever he went. He seemed to have recovered from the stress of the shoot, although now he was facing the stress of having to edit the footage into a show that met his standards. \"I'm so fried, bro,\" he said, strolling along the wide beach, with mountains framing a neon sunset. \"It's really nice to be somewhere like this, around all this natural beauty, and just chill.\"\n\nIn fact, White's time in Hawaii did not seem particularly chill. He said that his relationship with his long-term boyfriend had fallen apart because \"The White Lotus\" had taken over his schedule; his life was one long working vacation. And yet he was already thinking about scouting locations for the fourth season. \"I'm not in a relationship, I don't have kids,\" he said. \"I'd love to have a break, but two weeks in I'd be, like\"-he imagined himself sitting home, restless-\"what are we doing?\"\n\nNot all of White's projects have been manifestly personal. (He once spent a couple of weeks doctoring the script for \"The Emoji Movie.\") But, after the failure of \"Cracking Up,\" he fulfilled a promise to write something for Molly Shannon . The script became \"Year of the Dog,\" which was released in 2007, as White's directorial début. Shannon played Peggy, a lonely office worker who develops a passion for animal rights after the death of her dog, Pencil. In a different kind of film, Peggy might learn some lessons, find a boyfriend, and return to her office job, wiser and happier. Instead, a trapdoor seems to open in White's script, and Peggy falls through it. She commits financial fraud and attempts murder; offered an unlikely chance at redemption, she abandons her old life to devote herself to animal welfare. She explains her conversion, naturally, with a voice-over speech that is among the most cockeyed in the Mike White œuvre: \"How do I explain the things I've said and done? How do I explain the person I've become? I know I've disappointed everyone, and I'm sorry for that. I wish I was a more articulate person. I believe life is magical.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nBy the time White made the film, he was a vegan-he says that his opposition to animal cruelty is about as close as he comes to zealotry. Shannon and White are a reliably funny and off-kilter team (she also appears in \"Enlightened\" and \"The White Lotus\"), and not long ago she came to visit him in Hawaii. One day, while White was distracted with a phone call, Shannon tried to pet Peanut, who nipped her in the face. \"I have no hard feelings toward Peanut,\" Shannon told me. If anything, she seemed pleased to know that White had such a fierce protector.\n\nWhite says that, in some ways, the \"White Lotus\" character he most resembles is Quinn, the socially maladroit son from Season 1, who doesn't seem to care about anyone or anything until he joins a sea-canoeing crew of local men. Exalted, he decides not to go home.\n\nWhite now owns two houses on Kauai. Compared with the tourists, he is a local, but compared with the natives he is a wealthy interloper, not entirely different from the \"White Lotus\" characters he satirized. \"Unless I feel somehow personally indicted, it doesn't feel like I'm doing anything that bold,\" he told me. \"I have to take these people seriously enough that it isn't just a satire.\" One of Kauai's most famous part-time residents, Mark Zuckerberg, reportedly owns more than a thousand acres of beachfront property, including an underground bunker. But the difference between his compound and White's modest pair of houses is merely one of scale. \"I can make fun of Mark Zuckerberg-but I am also that person,\" White says.\n\nLast fall, HBO announced a global partnership with Four Seasons, the resort chain where the majority of all three seasons of \"The White Lotus\" were filmed. (The companies promise \"on-site activations at Four Seasons properties globally designed to engage audiences across multiple touchpoints.\") HBO sells \"White Lotus\" bathrobes, and Coffee-mate is celebrating the show's return with a \"White Lotus\"-branded nondairy creamer flavored like Thai iced coffee. One day, when I was having lunch with White, he got a text from his father, who still lives in California, proudly sharing the news that the show had made the front page of the Los Angeles Times . The headline read \" THAILAND GEARS UP FOR ROLE PAYOFF .\" The article reported that the country was expecting an influx of visitors thanks to the show.\n\nWhite recognizes that glamorous locales are essential to the reliable television formula that he describes as \"attractive people in beautiful places doing sexy, dirty shit.\" He was lured to Thailand not just by its narrative possibilities but also by tax incentives that the other main contender, Japan, was unable to match. Much of the season was filmed at a Four Seasons on Koh Samui, an island in the Gulf of Thailand, where a suite can cost as much as fifteen thousand dollars a night; some scenes were filmed at a secluded hillside hotel in Phuket. Footage of the two would be combined to create the fictional White Lotus Thailand.\n\nMost of the actors, like their characters, were visitors, but the cast also included a handful of renowned locals, none more renowned than Lalisa Manoban, the country's leading pop star, who is better known as Lisa, from the world-conquering K-pop group BLACKPINK . At first, White was wary of Manoban, even though she had a strong audition, not to mention a hundred and five million followers on Instagram. He didn't want to seem desperate for attention, and he wasn't sure he wanted to deal with the extra security that would be required. But he came to see that it might seem disrespectful, both to Manoban and to her country, not to cast her. When the news broke that she would have a part, some of the show's Thai staffers broke down in tears-and, White says, Thai officials became even more eager to help.\n\nWhite acknowledged that his desire to do right by Thailand sometimes conflicted with his lifelong desire to tell stories that are \"mischievous,\" as he puts it. \"There's moments where I'm, like, 'Do I want to show this side of Thailand?' \" he said. He was referring, perhaps, to the raffish culture down the hill in the Patong entertainment district, which is known for providing a more unpretentious vacation experience than the one typically depicted in the series: rowdy bars, late-night massage spas, Muay Thai fights. \"I feel this need to show the beauty, make people want to come here,\" White said.\n\nLast summer, when HBO released the first images from the new season, some viewers objected to the sepia tones: they thought it looked as if White had filmed Thailand with a so-called Mexico filter, an approach made infamous by the Steven Soderbergh movie \"Traffic,\" which contrasted yellow-tinted scenes set in Mexico with blue-tinted scenes set in the United States. (Critics felt that the yellow tint was a lazy way to evoke a world of heat, dirt, and disorder.) By December, when the first teaser was released, set to a song by the beloved Thai rock band Carabao, the images were noticeably less yellow.\n\nMany viewers have heard of the Bechdel test, named for the cartoonist Alison Bechdel, who in 1985 depicted a character saying that she would watch a movie only if it had at least two women in it who had a conversation about \"something besides a man.\" Watching the first season of \"The White Lotus,\" I found myself thinking about a different standard. I call it the pervert test. Whenever I see a nonwhite character onscreen, I find myself wondering, Could this character possibly be a pervert? Or at any rate a creep, a brute, a charlatan, a narcissist, a villain? Or will this character turn out to be drearily decent, possessed of no serious flaws except those which can be justified by the character's backstory or by the flaws of society?\n\nThe thought arose because \"The White Lotus\" is so full of transgression and bad behavior, especially when it comes to sex. In the first season, Steve Zahn plays Mark, who is thrown by the revelation that his late father was gay. His daughter, Olivia, played by Sydney Sweeney, torments him by cheerfully considering the precise arrangements. \"Even if he wasn't a top, it doesn't mean he was femme,\" she says. \"He could have still been butch, Dad.\" (Zahn's character does not find this consoling.) Armond, the hotel manager, played by the Australian actor Murray Bartlett, bears a resemblance to Basil Fawlty, the manic proprietor in \"Fawlty Towers,\" the old British sitcom. He is also a gay man who commits a spectacular act of sexual harassment, and an even more spectacular act of nonsexual harassment: in a frenzy of anger and desperation, he defecates in a guest's suitcase.\n\nUnderstandably, perhaps, White seems a bit more cautious when it comes to race. Natasha Rothwell, who plays the spa manager Belinda, is Black, and her character sometimes sounds like a spokesperson. \"The clientele here is mostly rich white people-and to be honest I struggle with that,\" she says in an early episode, as if expecting viewers to nod along. By the end of the season, though, these mostly rich white people have been complicated and, in some cases, vindicated. Olivia and her stringently progressive friend Paula, played by the biracial actor Brittany O'Grady, function as a kind of Greek chorus, offering deadpan observations of the world around them. But Paula turns out to be, if not precisely a pervert, then probably some kind of villain. \"I was, like, 'This is going to get me in trouble,' \" White said. \"But I felt like it was worth it.\" As it happened, there was not much trouble. Reviews were almost uniformly positive, and though one critic described Olivia's cracks about her grandfather's sexuality as \"disturbingly unfunny,\" it's not clear that White considers this a criticism.\n\nThe pervert test did not much apply to the second season, in which virtually everyone was white. That season was even more of a sensation than the first one, thanks in part to its debauched atmosphere. Two of the most memorable characters were high-spirited Sicilian sex workers. And White seemed to take particular pleasure in inverting his father's cosmology, as Tanya descended into a hellish subculture of what White describes as \"evil gays.\" The whooping theme song became an unlikely night-club hit, summoning a world of bad behavior.\n\nThe new season includes a hint of incest, or perhaps more than a hint, as well as a gay plotline that is, White promises, \"truly Satanic.\" He likes the idea of finding ways to depict gay life as transgressive, or even perverted-not, of course, to condemn it but to connect it to the rest of humanity, and the rest of human sexuality. \"It's not all harmless,\" he says. \"But it's not inherently harmful. It's inherently very natural. We're animals.\"\n\nWhite is intensely aware of how much the ethos of Hollywood has changed since the nineties, at least superficially. Back then, he says, the networks would quiz people like him about their female characters: \"Is she hot? Is she fuckable?\" Nowadays, he says, the same kinds of executives might ask, \"Do we have a person of color?\" His instinct has always been to resist these sorts of demands. In 2023, when the Writers Guild of America went on strike , one of its goals was to compel studios to increase the size of writers' rooms, which some people hoped would give more diverse writers a chance to learn the trade. White is unusual in that he works entirely alone, although he does solicit feedback on the finished scripts. \"I don't want a writers' room,\" he told me. \"I don't have time to mentor anybody, and I don't really want to be scrutinized that way.\" (In the end, the new deal retained an exception for writers who truly work alone.) White's approach means that he is often creating dialogue for characters who do not resemble him, in contravention of the idea that demographic authenticity is a necessary ingredient in a great script. But the opportunity to transgress boundaries of identity is one of his favorite parts of writing; many of his most celebrated characters, after all, are women. \"It's a pleasure to try to get inside someone's head,\" he says.\n\nFor this season, White brought back Belinda. On set in Thailand, I mentioned to Rothwell that many fans perceived Belinda as an oasis of decency, and I asked whether she ever wished that her character could be as indecent as some of the others. She told me that she had thought carefully about giving Belinda agency, and suggested that it might be possible to read her not as a spa manager with a heart of gold but as a strategic operator whose big idea-that Tanya will invest in her new business-suggests a certain degree of \"narcissism\" and \"hubris.\" When I relayed this interpretation to White, he sounded skeptical, but he did allow that Belinda might have a chance to make some mistakes of her own this season.\n\nWhen it comes to the depiction of Thai people, White seems to expect a fair amount of scrutiny. \"In Italy, all the Italian characters were running around fucking each other,\" he told me. \"If I had made the Thai characters all sex workers, it would have been a problem.\" Even one Thai sex worker might have been considered one too many, unless the portrayal was scrupulously high-minded. So he made sure that Manoban's character, a charming hotel employee named Mook, was someone that her fans could be proud of. \"She's not a pervert-she fails the pervert test,\" White said, almost apologetically. \"But she's a hustler. She's pushy.\"\n\nDespite his early exposure to Sam Shepard, White doesn't think of himself as particularly highbrow. \"I'm not really a Criterion guy,\" he says. One of his abiding passions is reality television, particularly shows in which competitors are made to suffer under pressure. In 2009, he appeared, with his father, on \"The Amazing Race,\" which sends pairs of contestants on around-the-world scavenger hunts. The Whites were portrayed as something of an oddity: a gay father-and-son duo, unusually kind to each other and to fellow-contestants. Mel, who was seventy, was the oldest person on the show, but far from the weakest. \"I think the other teams might think my dad is Cloris Leachman, but he's really MacGyver,\" Mike said, in the opening episode. After a series of mishaps, they were ejected in Phuket, and spent weeks in a house with other discarded contestants; the new season of \"The White Lotus\" is, in a way, White's chance for redemption.\n\nWhite is also a fan of \"Survivor,\" the gruelling elimination show. It is probably not a coincidence that \"Survivor\" and \"The White Lotus\" share a structural resemblance: a bunch of big-and often annoying-personalities convene in an exotic location, and audiences try to guess who is going to be eliminated. Over the years, White became friendly with the host of \"Survivor,\" Jeff Probst, and convinced him that he would make a great contestant. In 2018, White appeared on the show's thirty-seventh season, in Fiji, which matched overachieving \"Goliaths\" against underdog \"Davids.\" White was sorted into the Goliath tribe, and came close to winning the show's million-dollar prize by slipping into character as a more or less regular guy, unthreatening enough to evade attention. Probst told me, \"There were a couple of people who said, 'Is he a David or a Goliath?' I said, 'Are you kidding? Good luck winning an argument with Mike White.' \"\n\nLink copied\n\nOne reason viewers are drawn to reality television is that the rules governing identity and behavior aren't so strict: given sufficient time and duress, just about everyone will pass the pervert test. On \"Survivor,\" White had a frosty relationship with Natalie Cole, a self-possessed Black woman from Los Angeles who was sorted into the Goliath tribe, by virtue of her career as a newspaper and magazine publisher. By the third episode, White was complaining that Cole was \"an unpleasant drain around camp,\" and some of his fellow-Goliaths seemed to agree. If this had been a scripted series, Cole would have been given a chance to show that she wasn't so unpleasant, and White would have had a moment to confront his own assumptions, and possibly his own racism. But on \"Survivor\" this conflict went unresolved, especially since Cole was voted out in the fifth episode.\n\nNot long ago, though, she got an unexpected message from White, who wanted to know if she'd like to fly to Thailand for a small role in \"The White Lotus.\" He said that he respected her as a person and a competitor, and he liked the idea of affirming the connection between the two franchises. (\"Survivor\" contestants appeared in the first two seasons.) Cole agreed. \"We were kind of in conflict a lot,\" she recalled, in Phuket. Still, she suggested that White's scrupulous attention to behavior and body language helped explain both his success on \"Survivor\"and his success in Hollywood. \"It is personal, but, at the end of the day, it's a game,\" she said.\n\nTwelve years ago, when \"Enlightened\" was on the verge of being cancelled, White sat for an interview with Marc Maron , the comedian and podcaster. White sounded as if \"Enlightened\" was his one big shot, and he was bracing for it to be taken away. \"I had the Cinderella experience of the show,\" he said, noting that its ratings were unspectacular, with fewer than a million viewers a week. \"At some point, I'm going to come back to reality.\"\n\nNowadays, ratings are more mysterious, because streaming networks don't share data in a uniform or transparent way. (HBO said that the Season 2 finale of \"The White Lotus\" attracted more than four million viewers, although most of that number reflects people who watched some or all of the episode online.) Expectations of longevity have changed, too: many viewers no longer assume that a show will last more than a few seasons.\n\nIn this climate, the popularity of \"The White Lotus\" seems like something of a throwback to the age of prestige television. White has noticed that his friends are finding it harder to sell their TV and film ideas-in fact, \"The White Lotus\" was partly inspired by \"The Tears of St. Patsy,\" a proposed series starring Jennifer Coolidge as a frustrated actor navigating a dangerous world. When White shopped it to networks, no one was interested. (\"Everybody passed,\" he told the crowd at the Golden Globes, when he accepted an award for \"The White Lotus\" in 2023. Peering around the room, he added, \"I know you all passed.\") White still seems amazed that his little pandemic idea has turned into the biggest hit of his life. \"Somehow, I got on the last helicopter out of the dystopia that is Hollywood,\" he says.\n\nHe was sitting in one of the makeshift editing suites in Kauai: staffers had pushed aside a bed to install four monitors and two big speakers on tripods. A ceiling fan whirred, Peanut snored, and White calculated how much time he had to make small changes. \"HBO's not expecting it till Friday of next week, so there's no rush,\" he told one of the editors. This was Episode 6, of eight, and it was a little long. \"Sixty-three twenty-nine-ugh,\" White said. \"Are you trying to get me in trouble?\" Anything longer than an hour was likely to inspire suggestions from HBO, and White was not feeling particularly suggestible. He finds the editing process satisfying in a way that directing cannot be, because it yields something tangible: a finished episode, to justify the money he's getting from the network. On set, he is obliged to be enthusiastic, so that the actors don't get discouraged, but in the editing bay he is unsparing. \"It's a lot of eye acting going on,\" White said, disapprovingly, when he thought some facial gestures were unnecessarily big.\n\nAt least in its first two episodes, the new season is less fizzy than its predecessors, and more hardboiled: a show that once revolved around acerbic conversation now seems to be building toward a dénouement that involves at least one monk and at least one handgun. White's most important task is to locate that familiar mix of flavors-a kind of gin-and-tonic astringency-in every scene. At one point, he asked to reëdit a seemingly minor exchange that sounded too earnest. \"The sincerity of it is making me laugh,\" he said.\n\nIn some ways, the imperative of reinventing \"The White Lotus\" is an advantage: the cast changes, White says, actually help with morale: \"You're more in the dating stage. As opposed to 'I expected more out of my life and my marriage than this!' \"\n\nEven now, White thinks of \"The White Lotus\" as a bit of a fluke, and he knows there is no guarantee that people who loved the silly second season will also love the decidedly less silly third one. \"It isn't exactly a crowd-pleaser,\" he said. \"I don't know what it is, but we'll see.\" As far as he can tell, \"The White Lotus\" makes more sense in 2025 than it did in 2021, when the prevailing mood was a bit gentler and more earnest. \"I think the sensibilities of the culture have changed,\" he says. \"I think people want a little blood in the mouth.\" He is aware, though, that a brainy storyteller with a rather perverse sensibility is unlikely to remain at the center of mainstream culture indefinitely. \"I'm fifty-four years old,\" he told me. \"I feel like I've been out in the ocean, waiting for a wave. It's getting to sunset-maybe I'll just swim in. And then I catch a wave? I'm definitely going to ride this wave.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "A Raised Voice\n\n\"My skin is black,\" the first woman's story begins, \"my arms are long.\" And, to a slow and steady beat, \"my hair is woolly, my back is strong.\" Singing in a club in Holland, in 1965, Nina Simone introduced a song she had written about what she called \"four Negro women\" to a young, homogeneously white, and transfixed crowd. \"And one of the women's hair,\" she instructed, brushing her hand lightly across her own woolly Afro, \"is like mine.\" Every performance of \"Four Women\" caught on film (as here) or disk is different. Sometimes Simone coolly chants the first three women's parts-the effect is of resigned weariness-and at other times, as on this particular night, she gives each woman an individual, sharply dramatized voice. All four have names. Aunt Sarah is old, and her strong back has allowed her only \"to take the pain inflicted again and again.\" Sephronia's yellow skin and long hair are the result of her rich white father having raped her mother-\"Between two worlds I do belong\"-and Sweet Thing, a prostitute, has tan skin and a smiling bravado that seduced at least some of the eager Dutch listeners into the mistake of smiling, too. And then Simone hit them with the last and most resolutely up to date of the women, improbably named Peaches. \"My skin is brown,\" she growled ferociously, \"my manner is tough. I'll kill the first mother I see. 'Cause my life has been rough.\" (One has to wonder what the Dutch made of killing that \"mother.\") If Simone's song suggests a history of black women in America, it is also a history of long-suppressed and finally uncontainable anger.\n\nA lot of black women have been openly angry these days over a new movie about Simone's life, and it hasn't even been released. The issue is color, and what it meant to Simone to be not only categorically African-American but specifically African in her features and her very dark skin. Is it possible to separate Simone's physical characteristics, and what they cost her in this country, from the woman she became? Can she be played by an actress with less distinctively African features, or a lighter skin tone? Should she be played by such an actress? The casting of Zoe Saldana, a movie star of Dominican descent and a light-skinned beauty along European lines, has caused these questions-rarely phrased as questions-to dog the production of \"Nina,\" from the moment Saldana's casting was announced to the completed film's début, at Cannes, in May, at a screening confined to possible distributors. No reviewers have seen it. The film's director, Cynthia Mort, has been stalwart in her defense of Saldana's rightness for the role, citing not only the obvious relevance of acting skills but Simone's inclusion of a range of colors among her own \"Four Women\"-which is a fair point. None of the women in Simone's most personal and searing song escape the damage and degradation accorded to their race.\n\nIronically, \"Four Women\" was charged with being insulting to black women and was banned on a couple of radio stations in New York and Philadelphia soon after the recording was released, in 1966. The ban was lifted, however, when it produced more outrage than the song. Simone's husband, Andrew Stroud, who was also her manager, worried about the dangers that the controversy might have for her career, although this was hardly a new problem. Simone had been singing out loud and clear about civil rights since 1963-well after the heroic stand of figures like Harry Belafonte and Sammy Davis, Jr., but still at a time when many black performers felt trapped between the rules of commercial success and the increasing pressure for racial confrontation. At Motown, in the early sixties, the wildly popular performers of a stream of crossover hits became models of black achievement but had virtually no contact with the movement at all.\n\nSimone herself had been hesitant at first. Known for her sophisticated pianism, her imperious attitude, and her velvety rendition of \"I Loves You, Porgy\" (which, like Billie Holiday before her, she sang without the demeaningly ungrammatical \"s\" on \"loves\"), she had arrived in New York in late 1958, establishing her reputation not in Harlem but in the clubs of hip and relatively interracial Greenwich Village. Her repertoire of jazz and folk and show tunes, often played with a classical touch, made her impossible to classify. In these early years, she performed African songs but also Hebrew songs, and wove a Bach fugue through a rapid-fire version of \"Love Me or Leave Me.\" She tossed off the thirties bauble \"My Baby Just Cares for Me\" with airy insouciance, and wrung the heart out of the lullaby \"Brown Baby\"-newly written by Oscar Brown, Jr., about a family's hopes for a child born into a better racial order-erupting in a hair-raising wail on the word \"freedom,\" as though registering all the pain over all the years during which it was denied. For a while, \"Brown Baby\" was as close to a protest song as Simone got. She believed it was enough.\n\nAnd then her friend Lorraine Hansberry set her straight. It speaks to Simone's intelligence and restless force that, in her twenties, she attracted some of African-American culture's finest minds. Both Langston Hughes and James Baldwin elected themselves mentors: Simone, appearing on the scene just as Holiday died, seemed to evoke their most exuberant hopes and most protective instincts. But Hansberry offered her a special bond. A young woman also dealing with a startling early success-Hansberry was twenty-eight when \"A Raisin in the Sun\" won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award, in 1959-she had a strongly cultivated black pride and a pedagogical bent. \"We never talked about men or clothes,\" Simone wrote in her memoir, decades later. \"It was always Marx, Lenin and revolution-real girls' talk.\" A milestone in Simone's career was a solo concert at Carnegie Hall-a happy chance to show off her pianism-on April 12, 1963, which happened also to be the day that Martin Luther King, Jr., was arrested with other protesters in Birmingham, Alabama, and locked up in the local jail. The discrepancy between the events was pointed out by Hansberry, who telephoned Simone after the concert, although not to offer praise.\n\nTwo months later, Simone played a benefit for the N.A.A.C.P. In early August, she sang \"Brown Baby\" before a crowd gathered in the football stadium of a black college outside Birmingham-the first integrated concert ever given in the area-while guards with guns and dogs prowled the field. But Hansberry only started a process that events in America quickly accelerated. Simone watched the March on Washington, later that August, on television, while she was preparing for a club date. She was still rehearsing when, on September 15th, news came of the bombing of Birmingham's Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, killing four young African-American girls who had just got out of Bible class. Simone's first impulsive act, she recalled, was to try to make a zip gun with tools from her garage. \"I had it in my mind to go out and kill someone,\" she wrote. \"I didn't yet know who, but someone I could identify as being in the way of my people.\"\n\nThis urge to violence was not a wholly aberrant impulse but something that had been brewing on a national scale, however tamped down by cooler heads and political pragmatists. At the Washington march, John Lewis, then a leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, was forced to cut the word \"revolution\" from his speech and to omit the threat that, absent immediate progress, the marchers would go through the South \"the way Sherman did\" and \"burn Jim Crow to the ground.\" James Baldwin, in a televised discussion after the bombing, noted that, throughout American history, \"the only time that nonviolence has been admired is when the Negroes practice it.\" But the center held. Simone's husband, a smart businessman, told her to forget the gun and put her rage into her music.\n\nIt took her an hour to write \"Mississippi Goddam.\" A freewheeling cri de coeur based on the place names of oppression, the song has a jaunty tune that makes an ironic contrast with words-\"Alabama's got me so upset, Tennessee made me lose my rest\"-that arose from injustices so familiar they hardly needed to be stated: \"And everybody knows about Mississippi, goddam!\" Still, Simone spelled them out. She mocked stereotypical insults (\"Too damn lazy!\"), government promises (\"Desegregation / Mass participation\"), and, above all, the continuing admonition of public leaders to \"Go slow,\" a line that prompted her backup musicians to call out repeatedly, as punctuation, \"Too slow!\" It wasn't \"We Shall Overcome\" or \"Blowin' in the Wind\": Simone had little feeling for the Biblically inflected uplift that defined the anthems of the era. It's a song about a movement nearly out of patience by a woman who never had very much to begin with, and who had little hope for the American future: \"Oh but this whole country is full of lies,\" she sang. \"You're all gonna die and die like flies.\"\n\nShe introduced the song in a set at the Village Gate a few days later. And she sang it at a very different concert at Carnegie Hall, in March, 1964-brazenly flinging \"You're all gonna die\" at a mostly white audience-along with other protest songs she had taken a hand in writing, including the defiantly jazzy ditty \"Old Jim Crow.\" She also performed a quietly haunting song titled \"Images,\" about a black woman's inability to see her own beauty (\"She thinks her brown body has no glory\")-a wistful predecessor to \"Four Women\" that she had composed to words by the Harlem Renaissance poet Waring Cuney. At the time, Simone herself was still wearing her hair in a harshly straightened fifties-style bob-sometimes the small personal freedoms are harder to speak up for than the larger political ones-and, clearly, it wasn't time yet for such specifically female injuries to take their place in the racial picture. \"Mississippi Goddam\" was the song of the moment: bold and urgent and easy to sing, it was adopted by embattled protesters in the cursed state itself just months after Simone's concert, during what they called the Mississippi Summer Project, or Freedom Summer, and what President Johnson called \"the summer of our discontent.\"\n\nThere was no looking back by the time she performed the song outside Montgomery, Alabama, in March, 1965, when some three thousand marchers were making their way along the fifty-four-mile route from Selma; two weeks earlier, protesters making the same attempt had been driven back by state troopers with clubs, whips, and tear gas. The triumphant concert, on the fourth night of the march, was organized by the indefatigable Belafonte, at the request of King, and took place on a makeshift stage built atop stacks of empty coffins lent by local funeral homes, and in front of an audience that had swelled with twenty-five thousand additional people, drawn either by the cause or by a lineup of stars that ranged from Tony Bennett and Johnny Mathis to Joan Baez. Simone, accompanied only by her longtime guitarist, Al Schackman, drew cheers on the interpolated line \"Selma made me lose my rest.\" In the course of events that night, she was introduced to King, and Schackman remembered that she stuck her hand out and warned him, \"I'm not nonviolent!\" It was only when King replied, gently, \"Not to worry, sister,\" that she calmed down.\n\nSimone's explosiveness was well known. In concert, she was quick to call out anyone she noticed talking, to stop and glare or hurl a few insults or even leave the stage. Yet her performances, richly improvised, were also confidingly intimate-she needed the connection with her audience-and often riveting. Even in her best years, Simone never put many records on the charts, but people flocked to her shows. In 1966, the critic for the Philadelphia Tribune , an African-American newspaper, explained that to hear Simone sing \"is to be brought into abrasive contact with the black heart and to feel the power and beauty which for centuries have beat there.\" She was proclaimed the voice of the movement not by Martin Luther King but by Stokely Carmichael and H. Rap Brown, whose Black Power philosophy answered to her own experience and inclinations. As the sixties progressed, the feelings she displayed-pain, lacerating anger, the desire to burn down whole cities in revenge-made her seem at times emotionally disturbed and at other times simply the most honest black woman in America.\n\nLink copied\n\nShe recalled that racial anger first arose in her when she was eleven. Born Eunice Waymon, in 1933, she was the sixth of eight children of John and Kate Waymon, who were descendants of slaves and pillars of the small black community of Tryon, North Carolina. Her mother was a Methodist preacher, a severely religious woman who made extra money by cleaning house for a white Tryon family; her father, who had started off as an entertainer, worked at whatever the circumstances required. Even during the Depression, the Waymons made a good home. Simone's earliest memories were of her mother singing hymns, and both the house and the church were so filled with music that no one noticed little Eunice climbing up to the organ bench until, at the age of two and a half, she played \"God Be with You Till We Meet Again,\" straight through.\n\nYet as rare as the little girl's musical gifts is the way that, in that time and place, those gifts were encouraged. She began playing for her mother's sermons before her feet could reach the pedals, and was soon accompanying the church choir and Sunday services. She especially enjoyed playing for visiting revivalists, because of the raptures she discovered that she could loose in an audience with music. At the other end of the spectrum, she was five years old when the woman for whom her mother cleaned house offered to pay for lessons with a local piano teacher, Muriel Mazzanovich. The British-born Miz Mazzy, as Eunice called her-and also, later on, \"my white momma\"-inspired her love of Bach and her plans to become a great and famous classical pianist. Giving a recital in the local library, at eleven, Eunice saw her parents being removed from their front-row seats to make room for a white couple. She had been schooled by Miz Mazzy in proper deportment, but she nevertheless stood up and announced that if people wanted to hear her play they'd better let her parents sit back down in the front row. There were some laughs, but her parents were returned to their seats. The next day, she remembered, she felt \"as if I had been flayed, and every slight, real or imagined, cut me raw. But, the skin grew back a little tougher, a little less innocent, and a little more black.\"\n\nHer skin was very black, and she was made fully aware of that, along with the fact that her nose was too large. The aesthetics of race-and the loathing and self-loathing inflicted on those who vary from accepted standards of beauty-is one of the most pervasive aspects of racism, yet it is not often discussed. The standards have been enforced by blacks as well as by whites. Even Harry Belafonte wrote, in his memoir, about his mother's well-intentioned counsel to \"marry a woman with good hair,\" and he added, in unnecessary clarification, \"Good hair meant straight hair.\" (Reader, he married her.) But Nina Simone, strong and fierce and proud Nina Simone? \" I can't be white and I'm the kind of colored girl who looks like everything white people despise or have been taught to despise,\" she wrote in a note to herself, not during her adolescence but in the years when she was already a successful performer. \"If I were a boy, it wouldn't matter so much, but I'm a girl and in front of the public all the time wide open for them to jeer and approve of or disapprove of.\"\n\nCountering the charge of physical inferiority, in her youth, was the talent that her mother assured her was God-given. Music was her salvation, her identity. Thanks to a fund established by a pair of generous white patrons in Tryon, she was sent to board at a private high school-she practiced piano five hours a day, and graduated valedictorian-and then to a summer program at Juilliard, all with the unwavering aim of getting into the Curtis Institute of Music, in Philadelphia, where admission was terrifically competitive but tuition was free. Her destiny seemed so assured that her parents moved to Philadelphia before she took the Curtis exam. The fact that she was rejected, and believed that this was because of her race, was a source of unending bitterness. It was also a turning point. In the summer of 1954, in need of money, Eunice Waymon took a job playing cocktail piano in an Atlantic City dive-the owner demanded that she also sing-and, hoping to keep the news of this unholy employment from her mother, turned herself into Nina Simone, feeling every right to the anger that Nina Simone displayed forever after.\n\nAt times, it seemed that she could outdistance her feelings. In 1961, after a brief marriage to a white hanger-on at the Atlantic City club, she married Stroud, a tough police detective on the Harlem beat whom she initially sized up as \"a light-skinned man,\" \"well built,\" and \"very sure of himself.\" The following year, she gave birth to a daughter, Lisa Celeste, and Stroud left his job to manage Simone's career; they lived in a large house in the leafy Westchester suburb of Mount Vernon, complete with a gardener and a maid. Although she complained of working too hard and touring too much-of being desperately exhausted-her life was not the stuff of the blues. And then, before a concert in early 1967, Stroud found her in her dressing room putting makeup in her hair. She didn't know who he was; she didn't quite know who she was. She later remembered that she had been trying to get her hair to match her skin: \"I had visions of laser beams and heaven, with skin-always skin-involved in there somewhere.\"\n\nThe full medical facts of Simone's mental illness became public only after her death, in 2003, thanks to two British fan-club founders and friends of Simone's, Sylvia Hampton and David Nathan, whose account of the singer's career was aptly titled, after one of Simone's songs, \"Nina Simone: Break Down & Let It All Out\" (2004). Subsequent biographies-the warmly overdramatizing \"Nina Simone,\" by David Brun-Lambert (2009), and the coolly meticulous \"Princess Noire,\" by Nadine Cohodas (2010)-have filled in terrible details of depression and violence and long-sought but uncertain diagnoses: \"bipolar disorder\" appears to be the best contemporary explanation. Excerpts from Simone's diaries and letters of the nineteen-sixties, published by Joe Hagan (who got them from Andrew Stroud) in The Believer , in 2010, added the news that Simone's personal hell was compounded by regular beatings from Stroud. The marriage dissolved in 1970, but it was many more years before she received any helpful medication.\n\nAll the more remarkable, then, the strength that Simone projected through the sixties. As the decade wore on, she began to favor bright African gowns and toweringly braided African hair styles; she became the High Priestess of Soul, and though the title was no more than a record company's P.R. gambit-Aretha Franklin was soon crowned the Queen of Soul-she bore it with conviction. It would be wrong, however, to give the impression that her songs were mostly about civil rights. Stroud, with his eye on the bottom line, was always there to keep her from going too far in that direction. In concert, she even pulled back on \"Mississippi Goddam,\" singing \"We're all gonna die, and die like flies\" in place of the gleefully threatening \"You're all gonna die . . .\" Although she did record the classic anti-lynching ballad \"Strange Fruit,\" in 1965, and she could give the most unexpected songs an edge of racial protest (listen to her harrowing version of the Brecht-Weill \"Pirate Jenny\"), she had a vast and often surprising musical appetite. By the late sixties, she was so afraid of falling behind the times that she expanded her repertory to include Bob Dylan, Leonard Bernstein, and, covering all bases, the Bee Gees. One of her biggest hits of the era was the joyously innocuous \"Ain't Got No-I Got Life,\" from the musical \"Hair\"-which, in her hands, became a classic freedom song.\n\nBut womanly strength was in everything she sang: in the cavernous depths of her voice-some people think Simone sounds like a man-in her intensity, her drama, her determination. It's there in the crazy love song \"I Put a Spell on You,\" in which she recasts the crippling needs of love (\"Because you're mine! \") into an undeniable command. It's there in the ten-minute gospel tour de force \"Sinnerman,\" when she cries out \"Power!\" like a Southern preacher and her musicians shout back \"Power to the Lord!,\" and especially when she takes the disapproving voice of the Lord upon herself: \"Where were you, when you oughta been praying?\" If you'd never before thought of the Lord as a black woman, you did now.\n\nThe civil-rights songs were nevertheless what she called \"the important ones.\" And the movement is where she gained her strength. It's also where her private anger took on public dimensions, in the years when patience gave way entirely and the anger in many black communities could no longer be tamped down. Onstage in Detroit, on August 13, 1967-two weeks after a five-day riot had left forty-three people dead, hundreds injured, and the city in ruins-Simone, singing \"Just in Time,\" added a message to the crowd: \"Detroit, you did it. . . . I love you, Detroit-you did it!\" She was met with roars of approval, which one Detroit critic said he presumed had come from \"the arsonists, looters and snipers in the audience.\" Another critic, however, wrote that her show let white people know what they had to learn, and learn fast. Was she the voice of national tragedy or of the next American revolution?\n\nAnd then King was shot, on April 4, 1968. Sections of Washington, Chicago, Baltimore, and more than a hundred smaller cities went berserk. Despite her rhetoric, Simone was profoundly shaken, and her views of what might be accomplished in this country only grew more bleak. At an outdoor concert in Harlem, the following summer-it's available on YouTube-she went for broke.\n\nMajestically bedecked à l'africaine , she opened with \"Four Women,\" singing now before a crowd where an Afro was the norm. After several other stirring, politically focussed songs-\"Revolution,\" \"Backlash Blues\"-she closed with something so new that she had not had time to learn it, a poem by David Nelson, who was then part of a group called the Last Poets and is now among the revered begetters of rap. She read the words from a sheet of paper, moving across the stage and repeatedly exhorting the crowd to answer the question \"Are you ready, black people? . . . Are you ready to do what is necessary?\" The crowd responded to this rather vague injunction with a mild cheer, prompted by the bongos behind her and the demand in her voice. And then: \"Are you ready to kill, if necessary?\" Now a bigger, if somewhat incongruous, cheer rose from the smiling crowd filled with little kids dancing to the rhythm on a sunny afternoon. It had been five years since the Harlem riot of 1964, the granddaddy of sixties riots; New York had largely escaped the ruinations of both 1967 and 1968. \"Are you ready to smash white things, to burn buildings, are you ready?\" she cried. \"Are you ready to build black things?\"\n\nDespite her best efforts, Simone failed to incite a riot in Harlem that day in 1969. The crowd received the poem as it had received her songs: with noisy affirmation, but merely as part of a performance. People applauded and went on their way. There are many possible reasons: no brutal incident of the kind that frequently set off riots, massive weariness, the knowledge of people elsewhere trapped in riot-devastated cities, maybe even hope. Simone had her unlikeliest hit that year with a simple hymn of promise, \"To Be Young, Gifted and Black,\" based on the title of a play that had been put together from Lorraine Hansberry's uncollected writings. Hansberry, who died in 1965, had used the phrase in a speech to a group of prize-winning black students, and Simone asked a fellow-musician, Weldon Irvine, to come up with lyrics that \"will make black children all over the world feel good about themselves forever.\" Indeed, it is a children's song (or it was, until Aretha took it over). Simone's most moving performance may have been on \"Sesame Street,\" where she sat on the set's tenement steps wearing an African gown and lip-synched her recording to four enchanting if slightly mystified black children, who raised their arms in victory toward the end.\n\nIt was not a victory she could believe in or a mood she could sustain. By the end of the sixties, both Simone's career and her marriage were in serious trouble. Pop-rock did not really suit her, and the jazz and folk markets had radically shrunk; the concert stage still assured her income and her stature. And if the collapse of her marriage was in some ways a liberation she was also now without the person who had managed her finances and her schedule, and who had kept her calm before she went onstage (by forbidding her alcohol, among other means), and got her offstage quickly when the calm failed. She was left to govern herself in a world that suddenly had no rules and, just as frightening, was emptied of its larger, steadying purpose. \"Andy was gone and the movement had walked out on me too,\" she wrote, \"leaving me like a seduced schoolgirl, lost.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nLooking back on the historic protests and legislative victories of the sixties, one may find it easy to assume a course of inevitable if often halting racial progress, yet this was anything but apparent as the decade closed. When, in 1970, James Baldwin set out to write about \"the life and death of what we call the Civil Rights movement,\" its failure seemed to him beyond contention. As for the black leaders who had \"walked out\" on Simone, they were in cemeteries (Malcolm X, Medgar Evers, King, Fred Hampton), in jail (Huey Newton, Bobby Seale), or in Africa (Stokely Carmichael), or else had \"run for cover,\" as she put it, \"in community or academic programmes.\" White liberals had diverted their efforts to Vietnam; this was now the war being fought on televisions in living rooms every night. According to Simone, \"The days when revolution really had seemed possible were gone forever.\"\n\nShe left the country in 1974. Travelling to Liberia with her twelve-year-old daughter, she stayed for two years, during which she performed hardly at all. She left Liberia for Switzerland in order to put her daughter in school there. Eventually, she moved to France, alone. It seems to have been only the recurrent need for money that spurred her to perform again in the United States, although she took great pride in an honorary doctorate that she received from Amherst, in 1977, and insisted ever after on being called \"Doctor Nina Simone.\" Meanwhile, her concerts tended increasingly toward disaster. As she now sang in \"Mississippi Goddam,\" \"the whole damn world's made me lose my rest.\"\n\nThe remainder of her life, some twenty-five years, is a tale of escalating misery. At the worst, she was found wandering naked in a hotel corridor brandishing a knife; she set her house in France on fire, and once, also in France, she shot a teen-age boy (in the leg, but that may have been poor aim) in a neighbor's back yard for making too much noise-and for answering her complaints with what she understood as racial insults. Yet the ups of her life could be almost as vertiginous as the downs. In 1987, just a year after she was sent to a hospital in a straitjacket, her charmingly upbeat 1959 recording of \"My Baby Just Cares for Me\" was chosen by Chanel for its international television ad campaign. Rereleased, the record went gold in France and platinum in England. In 1991, she sold out the Olympia, in Paris, for almost a week.\n\nShe toured widely during her final years. In Seattle, in the summer of 2001, she worked a tirade against George W. Bush into \"Mississippi Goddam,\" and encouraged the audience to \"go and do something about that man.\" She was already suffering from breast cancer, but it wasn't the worst illness she had known. She was seen as a relic of the civil-rights era, and on occasion she even led the audience in a wistful sing-along of \"We Shall Overcome,\" although she did not believe her country had overcome nearly enough. Once she became too sick to perform, she did not return to what she called \"the United Snakes of America.\" She died in France, in April, 2003; her ashes were scattered in several African countries. The most indelible image of her near the end is as a stooped old lady reacting to the enthusiastic cheers that greeted her with a raised, closed-fisted Black Power salute.\n\nThirty-four years after Simone released \"Young, Gifted and Black,\" Jay Z reused the title for a song that describes the fate of many of those gifted children-\"Hear all the screams from the ghetto all the teens ducking metal\"-in twenty-first-century America. The rap connection with Simone is hardly surprising, since rap is where black anger now openly resides. Simone disliked the rap she knew, however, in part for displacing so much anger onto women-or, as she put it, for \"letting people believe that women are second class, and calling them bitches and stuff like that.\" Back in 1996, Lauryn Hill rapped an anything-you-can-do retort to a male counterpart, \"So while you imitatin' Al Capone / I be Nina Simone / And defecatin' on your microphone,\" but no one has really taken up the challenge of Simone's example. There was a minor uproar last year over Kanye West's sampling of phrases from Simone's recording of \"Strange Fruit\" (with her voice speeded up to an unrecognizable tinniness) in \"Blood on the Leaves,\" in which Simone's evocation of lynched black bodies is juxtaposed with West's personal concerns about \"second string bitches,\" cocaine, and the cost of paying off a baby mama versus a new Mercedes. Some people have seen a social statement here, but one can't help recalling Simone's broader reaction to rap: \"Hell, Martin and Malcolm would turn in their graves if they heard some of this crazy shit.\"\n\nAs for jazz, Simone was largely excluded from the history books for decades. Will Friedwald's seminal \"Jazz Singing,\" of 1990, mentioned her only in passing, as \"off-putting and uncommunicative\" and as the center of a cult \"that only her faithful understand.\" But Simone's eclecticism has slowly widened the very definition of jazz singing. And, ever since Presidential candidate Obama listed her version of \"Sinnerman\" as one of his ten favorite songs of all time, in 2008, the cult has gone mainstream. There's now a burgeoning field of what may be called Simone studies-Ruth Feldstein's \"How It Feels to Be Free\" and Richard Elliott's \"Nina Simone\" offer two highly intelligent examples-and Friedwald's even more authoritative volume of 2010, \"A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers,\" includes a lengthy entry on Simone that pronounces her \"more important than anyone\" in her influence on twenty-first-century jazz singing.\n\nLast year, two Broadway shows depicted Simone as an inspiration for a couple of unexpected figures: in \"A Night with Janis Joplin,\" she helped to provide her white soul sister with the gift of fire, and, even stranger, in the crude but enthusiastic \"Soul Doctor\"-which reopens Off Broadway this winter-she was the force behind the \"rock-and-roll rabbi\" Shlomo Carlebach. Nutty as it seemed onstage, Simone's acquaintance with the rabbi appears to have some basis in fact, and helps to explain the Hebrew songs she performed at the Village Gate (where he also performed) in the early sixties. While it may be a show-biz exaggeration to suggest that the rabbi and the jazz singer had an affair-the show featured an Act I curtain clinch that, on the night I saw it, had its largely Orthodox audience literally gasping-the point was the universality of Simone's message about persecution, the search for justice, and the power of music.\n\nBack in 1979, at a concert in Philadelphia, Simone followed a performance of \"Four Women\" by scolding the black women in the audience about their changes in style: \"You used to be talking about being natural and wearing natural hair styles. Now you're straightening your hair, rouging your cheeks and dressing out of Vogue .\" In 2009, the comedian Chris Rock made a documentary titled \"Good Hair\" because, he explained, his young daughter had come to him with the question \"Daddy, how come I don't have good hair?\" For an African-American child, nothing had changed since Harry Belafonte's mother's advice, more than half a century earlier. (According to one contented businessman in Rock's film, African-Americans-twelve per cent of the population-buy eighty per cent of the hair products in this country.) As for skin tone, the cosmetic companies have been expanding their range ever since Iman established a line of darker foundations, in 1994, although in March, 2014, a former beauty director of Essence , Aretha Busby, complained to the Times ,\"The companies tend to stop at Kerry Washington. I'd love to see brands go two or three shades darker.\"\n\nThe question of skin tone and hair and their meaning for African-American women exploded on the Internet with the announcement of the casting of Saldana in the Hollywood bio-pic about Simone. When the idea for such a film was initially floated, in the early nineties, Simone herself gave the nod to being played by Whoopi Goldberg. When, in 2010, the present film was announced in the Hollywood Reporter , Mary J. Blige-the reigning Queen of Hip-Hop Soul-was announced for the lead. Once Blige was replaced with Saldana, however, a woman whose skin tone is more than two or three shades lighter than Simone's, the cries for boycotting the film on the basis of misrepresentation-on the basis of insult-were instantaneous. Why not cast Viola Davis? Or Jennifer Hudson? Production photographs showing Saldana on the set with an artificially broadened nose, an Afro wig, and-inevitably, but most unfortunately-dark makeup that is all too easily confoundable with blackface rendered any hope of calm discussion futile. It's been suggested that the filmmakers might as well have cast Tyler Perry in full \"Madea\" drag.\n\nSimone's daughter has come out against the film because its story focusses on an invented love affair as much as for the casting of Saldana, although she is quick to point out how much her mother's appearance shaped her life. (Lisa once told an interviewer that her mother would sometimes \"traumatize\" her because she is light-skinned-\"and I'd remind her that she had chosen my father, I didn't.\") The fight over the film ultimately extended to a lawsuit filed by the director, Cynthia Mort, against the British production company, Ealing Studios Enterprises, on the very eve of the screening at Cannes. Since then, though, the suit has been dismissed, so \"Nina\" may yet show up in a theatre near you. And Saldana may give a compelling performance-may well prove that she can play not only women who are sci-fi blue (as in \"Avatar\") or green (as in \"Guardians of the Galaxy\") but real-life black. Still, there is no escaping the fact that her casting represents exactly the sort of prejudice that Simone was always up against. \"I was never on the cover of Ebony or Jet ,\" Simone told an interviewer, in 1980. \"They want white-looking women like Diana Ross-light and bright.\" Or, as Marc Lamont Hill writes in Ebony today, \"There is no greater evidence of how tragic things are for dark-skinned women in Hollywood than the fact that they can't even get hired to play dark-skinned women.\" Well beyond Hollywood, these outworn habits of taste reverberate down the generations, infecting all of us.\n\nSimone's favorite performer in her later years was Michael Jackson. She brought cassettes of his albums with her everywhere, and recalled having met him on a plane when he was a little boy, and telling him, \"Don't let them change you. You're black and you're beautiful.\" She anguished over his evident failure to believe what she'd said: the facial surgeries, the mysterious lightening of his skin, the fatality of believing, instead, what the culture had told him, and wanting to be white. Simone appeared onstage with him just once, amid a huge cast of performers gathered for Nelson Mandela's eightieth birthday, in Johannesburg, in the summer of 1998. She was sixty-five years old, and photographs of the event show her standing between Mandela and Jackson, overweight yet glamorously done up, her hair piled in braids and her strapless white blouse a contrast to the African costumes of the chorus all around. But she was also very frail. In one photograph, Jackson-in his glittering trademark military-style jacket, hat, and shades-holds her left hand in both his hands, in a gesture of affection. But in another shot he has put one steadying arm around her, and she is grasping his hand for support. Few people seem aware of what is happening. The stage remains a swirl of laughter and song, a joyous African celebration. And at its center the two Americans stand with hands clasped tight-one hand notably dark, the other notably fair-as though trying to help each other along a hard and endless road. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "My Fears for the \"Crazy Rich Asians\" Sequels\n\nWarner Bros. confirmed on Wednesday that plans are moving forward to turn \"Crazy Rich Asians\" into a big-screen franchise after the romantic comedy touched a cultural nerve , generating nearly $40 million in ticket sales during its first six days in theaters. - The Times .\n\n\"Crazy Rich Asians 2\"\n\nPicking up where the first installment left off, Astrid and Charlie's romantic relationship continues to beautifully unfold until, halfway through the movie, a white guy shows up and starts asking members of the otherwise all-Asian cast, \"What kind of Asian are you?\" This ruins everything to such an extent that no one makes a movie with an all-Asian cast ever again.\n\n\"Crazy Rich White People \"\n\nBradley Cooper and Scarlett Johansson star as two wealthy thirtysomethings who are mostly in love with their money, and sometimes in love with each other. The film bombs at the box office and even though every actor and actress in it was white, no one makes a movie with an all-Asian cast ever again.\n\n\"Crazy Rich Donald Trump \"\n\nDonald Trump spends the entire film complimenting Elaine Chao on her \"excellent English\" and eating Asian chicken salad at a Trump Hotel. Then he still gets to be President, and as further excruciating punishment, no one makes a movie with an all-Asian cast ever again.\n\n\"Crazy Rich Oprah\"\n\nIn this fairy tale of a film, Oprah Winfrey skillfully convinces Barack and Michelle Obama to return to politics. Michelle is elected President in a landslide victory, while Barack serves as doting Vice-President. In the movie's final scene, Oprah-filling a new Cabinet position, Secretary of Good-travels around the country handing out free health-care and college-tuition vouchers. Exiting audiences buzz with giddy delight, only to emerge into the harsh reality of a seemingly endless Trump Presidency, in which people are still not making more movies with all-Asian casts for some goddam reason.\n\n\"Crazy Rich Elon Musk \"\n\nMusk buys the rights to the sequel and casts only himself. In the first three hours, he angry-tweets about the media, and self-congratulatory-tweets about himself. The next three hours show Musk laughing maniacally in front of a mirror. Critics call it \"bizarre\" and \"brilliant,\" and Hollywood does go on to make another movie with an all-Asian cast, but only after thirty straight years of movies starring only white people.\n\n\"Crazy Rich Venture Capitalists \"\n\nThis sequel follows V.C.s in Silicon Valley as they invest in startups with mostly white founders. When one startup with an Asian founder earns venture backing, V.C.s declare an end to their \"diversity problem\" and go back to only funding white males. Studio execs never make a movie with an all-Asian cast again, but they do encourage Asians to take on roles \"behind the camera.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Americans Think They're Smarter Than Average, Especially Rich White Guy Americans\n\nPhoto by auremar / Shutterstock\n\nYou may think you're smart, but you're dumb. I'm simplifying ('cause you're dumb), but that is the cheering overall conclusion of a new survey by the research organization YouGov. The online questionnaire of 991 Americans finds that 55 percent believe they are smarter than the average person. (Or, as writer Peter Moore sardonically phrases it, \"the average American thinks they are smarter than the average American.\") Meanwhile, \"a third of the country (34%) say that they are about as smart as the average person, while only four percent say that they are less intelligent than average Americans.\" As a country, it's strange that we are so intelligent yet not astute enough to see when we're inflating our own brainpower.\n\nBreak down the data further, and additional patterns emerge. As the National Journal points out , men are likelier than women to consider themselves \"much more intelligent\" than Joe or Jane American. (This reminds me of attribution studies that reveal how men often ascribe their successes to skill and hard work, whereas women usually credit fate/the stars/fairy godmothers/anything but themselves.) White people prove likelier to tout their intellects than black and Hispanic people. The wealthy-those earning over $100,000 a year-far more frequently deem their fellow Americans unintelligent. For poor respondents (those earning under $40,000 a year), the opposite is true: They tend to perceive other citizens as wise.\n\nHar dee har. It is pretty funny that we overestimate our brilliance, we dim bulbs in the string above the bathroom mirror. But if you focus on who exactly feels so confident in their smarts, these results seem less like a punchline and more like the trap door into an entire unseen network of justifications for inequality. What does it mean when people of privilege-the white, male, and wealthy-disproportionally think they've aced the bell curve? I don't want to read too much into one poll, but there is plenty of other research to back up the numbers. As psychologist Michael Kraus finds, those with higher social status more often hold \"essentialist\" ideas about class structure -they believe that one's genes determine one's place on the economic ladder. Disadvantaged people generally disagree: They tell researchers that social status drops down onto individuals like a net from the sky.\n\nI understand the comfort of assuming that your triumphs reflect your native worth (and that your failures speak to cosmic fickleness). But as author Daniel Goleman explains in an article for the New York Times (clicky headline: \" Rich People Just Care Less \"), the sense of entitlement on the part of the well-to-do-money cannot resist the gravitational pull of my big brain!-is self-perpetuating. Goleman writes about how men and women of privilege withhold \"empathetic attention\" from those they perceive to have lower social status. In conversation, these titans of income interrupt more, express less sympathy for misfortune, let their eyes wander, and don't smile. Meanwhile, Goleman argues, \"poor people are better attuned to interpersonal relations-with those of the same strata, and the more powerful ... because they have to be .\" (For the desperate, no resource-including a social tie-is invisible.) When you don't bother to get to know someone who seems different, innate ingroup and outgroup biases fog your judgments. Rich-person myths about the shiftlessness of the poor flourish in the empathy gap.\n\nSo privilege erases the need to acknowledge the needy, ignorance of others breeds contempt, and the end result is that a lot of rich white guys polled by YouGov think their fellow Americans are a bunch of dum-dums. Why this matters: As we know, inequality is perhaps the biggest issue facing the United States in 2014. It has reached Gilded Age levels . It is only growing more intractable . One of the huge obstacles to addressing it with the full measure of our American souls is the conviction that it reflects a kind of justice. \"Sociologically, America today may be the worst of all worlds for those who are neither top income earners nor top wealth successors: you are poor, and depicted as dumb and undeserving,\" writes Brad DeLong in a review of Thomas Piketty's Capital in the Twenty-First Century . While, as Piketty observes, \"nobody was trying to depict Ancien Regime inequality as fair,\" the American Dream supposedly converts intelligence and virtue into mansions and trust funds. If you haven't made it yet, the argument goes, you're just not dreaming hard enough. (This kind of thinking also works its way into the advice given to women and minorities: Unhappy with your lot in life? Lean in! Pull yourself up by your bootstraps!) The national reverence for intelligence is a beautiful thing, but not when it blurs out the advantages conferred by the right gender, race, and class.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "It's Even More Painful to Watch Emily in Paris in France\n\nAs an American living in France who's dealt with the loneliness and frustration of moving to a new country, I was really looking forward to bingeing Netflix's new hit Emily in Paris . The show focuses way too much on rich white pretty people, but given that it's a Darren Star series, that's not exactly shocking, and if it had made good on the promise to juxtapose two cultures and encourage Americans to see how they are viewed by the rest of the world, I could've looked past all of that. Instead, Emily reinforces caricatures of both Americans and French, minus any self-analysis, depth, or personal change on the part of our heroine. The show exemplifies how Hollywood, much like Emily, is too steeped in its own narcissism to allow for any self-reflection-even when the French hold up a mirror. It's easy enough to take an American out of the U.S. and plop her in another country. The real challenge is taking the American out of an American, wherever they are. Emily in Paris suffers from a bad case of what one might call the American gaze-the utter inability to see another country or culture without using our assumed superiority as the lens through which it's understood.\n\nFacing my own American narcissism has been the most challenging part of moving abroad, and it's something I'm still unlearning. Like Emily, I came here with Amélie as a reference for French culture, also knowing nothing about Normandy other than what I was taught in school: that it was where Americans saved the world from Nazis. I've been lectured about needing to be more thoughtful of my surroundings and adapt to them rather than the other way around. Emily's co-worker asks her the first day why she's shouting in a meeting. My French husband still has to remind me, even years after moving to France, that I'm using my outdoor voice unnecessarily. \"Is talking competitive in America too?\" he asked.\n\nThe best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox three times a week.\n\nLike Emily's, my Instagram used to be full of photos of myself, my friends, and strangers. After getting called out by my French buddies, I toned it way down. In general, the French value their privacy on social media far more than most Americans do. Emily's boss criticizes her several times for being \"accessible to everyone\" and having \"no mystery,\" but this goes right over the burgeoning influencer's head. Finally, her boss orders her to delete her account, which creates an existential crisis for Emily. \"I don't even know who I am without Emily in Paris!\" she says, as if this shell of a public figure is as deep as she gets. Emily can't imagine a world in which privacy is highly valued, even though she's living in that world and is lectured about it repeatedly. France actually has some of the world's strictest privacy laws , meaning Emily could get in trouble for using people's images without their consent-probably something a would-be social media personality should know about the country she's \"influencing.\"\n\nIn a sense, it's not really Americans' fault we're so self-centered. We've been told our entire lives that America is the best country in the world (as opposed to the 28 th !) and that ours is the best way of doing things. It is , however, our responsibility to reexamine the belief that America is the default by which all other cultures are measured, especially Emily's white, hypercapitalistic, puritanical version of America. But Emily never does, because the closest her character comes to self-examination is taking selfies.\n\nEmily in Paris is centered mostly on its heroine's job-and how very American it is for work to be the No. 1 priority! This bubbly twentysomething with oddly unshakable self-confidence moves to Paris to help a French firm up its game on social media, since, as she puts it, \"Americans invented it.\" Emily has a few smoking hot French lovers and makes some friends along the way, but most of her life is about work, an arrangement she sees zero problem with. It's taken me years of living in France to break the habit of working at least one weekend day, and I still feel ridiculously guilty if I'm not being \"productive\" all the time. My husband constantly reminds me of how toxic this American mentality is, especially when I project it on him. \"But you're not doing anything,\" I'll say sometimes when he's just relaxing. \"Yeah, that's the point!\" he has to remind me-even on our honeymoon. In theory, I agree with him, which is one reason I moved here. But in practice, it's so much harder to just enjoy life instead of constantly striving for success. When a French co-worker calls Emily out on tying her self-worth and happiness to work, money, and success, she says, \"Maybe that's a little arrogant.\"\n\nOne of the more pronounced ways Emily's ugly Americanness shows itself is in her insistence on speaking English, and only English-so much so that she doesn't even learn the French words for \"Do you speak English?\" Instead she goes around shouting in English at strangers as if they're the idiots for not understanding her. There's even a scene where Emily dines at a restaurant with a Southern woman, both of them delighted that this place doesn't so much as allow French to be spoken. The nerve!\n\nOn some level, I can relate to this gross laziness. Who wouldn't rather fall back on their native tongue and leave the mental gymnastics to others? A long weekend at my non-Anglophone in-laws' leaves my brain fried like an egg in an anti-drug commercial . Americans often interpret French people's insistence on speaking their own language as a function of nationalism, arrogance, or rudeness. But it's not that French people are unwilling to speak English. It's more that they're deeply insecure about it, and also don't see why they should have to do all the work when you're the visitor. We're the rude ones. If Emily made the tiniest soupcon of effort, she would have been liked much more (which is all she wanted!). Instead, she just dismisses French people as difficult, and decides that Paris just doesn't like her.\n\nAlong with her linguistic chauvinism, Emily brings over her puritanical ideas around sex, assuming she's morally superior to her boss and all the other married French people who are having affairs, despite the fact that she's never been married herself or been in an open relationship. One of the things I found hardest to come to terms with about my Americanism was my internalized slut-shaming, coming from a culture colonized by the most backassward religious freaks in Europe. Fortunately, I managed to shed shame-based ideas around sex long before landing here. In fact, I've slept around way more than any of my French friends or partners. Emily, however, is still stuck in ideas about monogamy and perfect pairings derived less from American life than American movies. Emily's boss calls her out on the idea that \"the knight on a white horse is going to come and save you from everything.\" Emily-trying, to her brief credit, to translate her analogy into French terms-explains she's not someone who can \"share\" a crepe. \"I want the whole crepe.\"\n\nNormally I'm harder on American films and TV than my French husband is. He's a French actor turned writer who not only studied American-style filmmaking but finds it far superior to the French approach, so it's rare for him to hate American shows (even terrible ones!). But Emily in Paris truly pissed him off-not just because its version of France is grossly inaccurate, but because it's used as a straw man to prop up ideas about American superiority. Every country is guilty of falling back on simplistic notions about other countries, but he's confident France would never make a show this tone-deaf: \"Unlike Americans, French people, and most people in general, are aware another point of view even exists.\"\n\nThe first time I realized how much I needed to deal with my American narcissism was in a shower with a former French boyfriend, who insisted on holding the showerhead. \"In America, we just stand under it, hands-free, like this,\" I explained. He looked at me with loving indulgence, \"Chérie, the whole world knows how Americans take showers. We watch your movies all the time .\" My French husband knows more about my culture than I'll probably ever know about his, and he's never even been to the U.S. Like Emily, I come from a country that imports little to no foreign culture-other than the stuff we steal, rebrand, then claim as our own. (I thought Inspector Gadget was a strictly American show until I caught my husband singing a very different song .) Or when we do import a French film, like Cuties , American senators try to cancel Netflix and accuse its brilliant director of making kiddie porn . And yet we shamelessly blast our violent red, white, and blue content-TV shows, movies, apps, porn, music, you name it-at the world, so much that they have to make laws to protect themselves from the relentless onslaught.\n\nWhile I appreciate the attempt Emily in Paris makes toward grappling with the struggles of moving to France-especially getting used to the complaining and the subtleties of \" the French no \"-Emily never questions her way of doing things and even gets rewarded for not caring to. She easily makes friends, has guys vying for her, and shows up her boss. After all, part of being American is having the power to not acknowledge your narrowness of mind. I'd love to see a show that truly deprograms the American gaze, one whose characters follow the advice the French keep giving Emily, to talk less and listen more. Until then, I'll be over here trying my best not to yell indoors or judge my husband for doing absolutely nothing on his day off.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Michael Jackson's Influence on Beyoncé's \"Formation,\" Explained\n\nPhoto illustration by Slate. Screenshots via michaeljacksonVEVO and Beyoncé\n\nIn \"Formation,\" Beyoncé proudly shouts out her black Southern roots and calls up imagery of Hurricane Katrina and the Black Lives Matter movement. At the Super Bowl the day after it premiered, she took the overtly political imagery even further , with dancers in black berets as an homage to the Black Panthers who at one point even formed an X on the field, presumably a nod to Malcolm X. After almost 20 years of intense scrutiny by the public, of having her appearance, personal life, and \"street cred\" interrogated, she wanted to let everyone know that she's not the apolitical, perfectly curated, tabula rasa we long assumed she was.\n\nPerhaps she was taking a cue from one of her childhood idols, to whom she also paid sartorial tribute during her Super Bowl performance: Michael Jackson. In 1987, after almost 20 years of intense scrutiny by the public, of having his appearance , personal life, and \"street cred\" interrogated, Jackson made a similarly socially conscious statement to his fans.\n\nThat year, Jackson debuted the characteristically elaborate short film for \"Bad,\" in which he plays Daryl, a kid from the inner city who returns home after finishing his first semester at a fancy, all-white prep school. Daryl is stuck between two worlds, unsure of where he fits in-slightly uncomfortable among the rich white kids, but no longer willing to get into trouble with his wayward childhood friends (including Wesley Snipes, in his debut) from his impoverished Brooklyn neighborhood. They teasingly address him as \"college,\" and become upset with his newfound reluctance to participate in their schemes of mugging strangers, claiming he's not \"down\" anymore and has gone \"soft.\" Daryl pushes back against this criticism, which leads us into the iconic West Side Story - esque musical centerpiece set in a Brooklyn subway station, in which he sings about how \"bad\" he is.\n\nLike Jackson, Beyoncé has been subject to criticism throughout her career that she does not align herself enough with the black community: Accusations of a nose job and lightening of her skin , whether through bleaching or the power of photo shop, have fluttered around her image, while her perceived lack of public activism in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement (up until now) struck many as disappointing. (And let's not forget the unfortunate, icky public spat between husband Jay Z and Harry Belafonte about activism within the hip hop community.) On top of that, her music and image from the days of Destiny's Child up until her unabashed \"feminist\" branding in Beyoncé was harmless and non-threatening in a way that was not merely cross-cultural or palatable to white audiences-it made them love her, just as much as black people do. By offering up expertly crafted pop-infused R&B songs and R&B-infused pop songs about either a) love or b) being independent, she tapped into a universal language, with top-notch dance pieces to match.\n\nBeyoncé and Jackson are the very definition of what it means to be a cross-cultural success as a black American, and the position is a difficult one to be in. Along the way, it's expected that you have to discard or obscure the parts of who you are that are not deemed acceptable by white people. Both Beyoncé and Jackson walked this line throughout their careers, with their million-dollar Pepsi deals and closely chronicled friendships with famous white A-listers such as Elizabeth Taylor and Gwyneth Paltrow .\n\nWhich is why it's so interesting that both of them, decades into their respective careers and still at the top of their game, chose to make such bold artistic statements reminding the world of their blackness. There is nothing subtle about the ways in which they did this. In \"Bad,\" a white colleague tells Daryl that he's \"proud\" of how well he's done in school, an unintentionally condescending compliment that Daryl takes in stride. In a brief montage showcasing Daryl's commute back home, he goes from being surrounded by his white classmates on the Metro North train, until slowly they fade away, and he's left behind with a few remaining riders (all people of color) when they get to the final stop of Grand Central. Later, when he arrives at an empty apartment (his mom, played by Roberta Flack in voiceover, has left him a note saying she's at work), the camera pans the wall of his bedroom, which is adorned with pictures of famous black faces, most notably a statuesque Afro-sporting Quincy Jones and Stevie Wonder. And of course, he confronts the question of his blackness head-on by having Mini Max (Snipes) ask him, \"Are you bad? Or is that what they teach you in that sissy school of yours-how to forget who your friends are?\"\n\nFor Beyoncé's part, her reaffirmation in \"Formation\" includes collard greens, carrying hot sauce in her purse, her daughter's \"baby hair afro,\" and (ironically) \"Negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils.\" It also represents the horrors of systemic racism in the forms of police brutality and government-sanctioned negligence, as demonstrated in the video's imagery of a young boy dancing in front of a chorus line of police officers, and her submergence into water while on top of a cop car.\n\nThe message of both these videos is clear: Yes, we are the biggest stars in the world, but we are not immune to the pangs of racism. Which is undoubtedly true. Yet in both \"Bad\" and \"Formation\" there's a fair amount of disconnect between the artist and the message on display.. As they seek to prove how \"bad\" they are or just how much they \"slay,\" they hope the rest of us (black people) will see ourselves as one with them, the iconic pop star. (\"We can change the world tomorrow, it could be a better place,\" Jackson sings; \"Okay ladies, now let's get in formation,\" Beyoncé commands.)\n\nBut Jackson was far removed from the rough streets of Gary, Indiana by then, and according to the music video's director, Martin Scorsese, he was shocked when they arrived in the rough Brooklyn location where they shot scenes for the video. (\" Do people live here? \" he apparently asked Scorsese, nervously.) Then there's the absurdity in his hiring \"an asthmatic Italian [Scorsese] and an asthmatic Jew [writer Richard Price] to help \" show the brothers that he's down with them ,\" as Price himself amusingly stated in Spike Lee's 2012 documentary about the making of the album. Meanwhile, Beyoncé, who also has lived the majority of her life in a somewhat sheltered bubble of fame, brags about going to Red Lobster after a particularly satisfying lay with her man while invoking Katrina and sampling the queer minority voices of Big Freedia and Messy Mya in the name of capitalism.\n\nIt's difficult to understand what to do with such mixed messaging. On the one hand, these gestures toward this idea of blackness could be read as proof that no matter how big a star a black performer becomes, there will always be a desire to try to stay rooted in their community, away from the white, mainstream eye. And for many, the black pride messaging has worked. In that Spike Lee documentary, music writer Danyel Smith likens the final moments of \"Bad,\" when Mini Max and Daryl reach a mutual respect, to church : \"If he was trying to reaffirm to people ... the soulfulness that he has, and frankly, the blackness that he was, it's those last 30 seconds.\" Yet when that display of blackness is accompanied by a world tour and apparel adorned with the latest catchphrase that the star coined or revitalized for a mainstream audience, it might not go down as smoothly.\n\nNor should a single video/song stand as the sole measurement of how \"down\" for the cause a star is-it's telling that the 5-minute musical section of \"Bad\" is often shown by itself, completely divorced from the actual narrative, on YouTube and on television, with no indication whatsoever of all the politics that swirl through that number. (I am a huge Michael Jackson fan, but it wasn't until he died that I realized that part even existed.) It's as if the explicit story of Jackson's agonizing over his cross-cultural success as a black man was deemed unimportant in retrospect. For his part, he showed his appreciation for and identification with the black community in other ways, namely in interviews and songs .\n\nWhether Beyoncé will do the same remains to be seen, though unlike the construction of \"Bad,\" she takes it a step further by making it impossible to isolate the music from the message. We have no clue as to what her next album will be like, if \"Formation\" is a one-off political track, or if she's made the next Rhythm Nation 1814 , in keeping with a different famous Jackson. But this is her \"Bad\" moment, another way for her to echo her idol and further burnish her place in pop music (and now, political) history.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "\"Everything Is Not The Wire \"\n\nPhoto illustration by Lisa Larson-Walker. Photo by Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images.\n\nThe latest HBO project from David Simon is the miniseries Show Me a Hero , which details a late-1980s fight over a public housing development in Yonkers, New York. Based on a true story, it touches on many of the issues that have long fascinated Simon: race relations, corruption, and the inner working of cities. A former crime reporter at the Baltimore Sun , Simon went on to serve as a writer on the NBC show Homicide: Life on the Street (which was adapted from a book he wrote) before creating The Wire , the already canonical depiction of a place that has lately been at the center of so much commentary about the ills of modern-day America.\n\nI spoke with Simon this week about his new show, the events that followed the death of Freddie Gray, and why an end to the drug war could radically change American life. The conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nIsaac Chotiner: The Wire had five seasons and each season showcased a different aspect of the city. I'm wondering if you think about your career in terms of shows, with each show representing an aspect of some larger vision, and if so what this new show represents.\n\nDavid Simon: I don't know if I can parse it that cleanly. I certainly don't want to tell the same story twice. The reportorial instinct is to find some other friction point in society and attend to that, and find a narrative to discuss something fresh, something we haven't argued about yet.\n\nIt's interesting that you said \"reportorial instinct.\" Is that what drives the creation of your shows?\n\nI think so. That doesn't mean we aren't behaving as dramatists, because we are. And I am not suggesting in any way that what we are producing is journalism. It is not. But the things that made me interested in being a newspaperman or a journalist remain my motivations. I understand that I need to be entertaining. But I am not particularly interested in making the most entertaining stories unless they are actually contending with an argument that matters. That's been static throughout my entire life as a writer.\n\nDifferent people go into journalism for different reasons: to tell stories, to report on things that lead to social change, etc. I don't know if you consider yourself an activist, but do you hope that people watch your shows and come to conclusions about the kind of policies they'd like to see? Do you work with that utilitarian mindset?\n\nI am thinking with a utilitarian mindset, but I am not actually believing that my storytelling will lead directly to fixing anything. I didn't believe that when I was doing straight journalism, maybe as a defense mechanism. In all my experience of doing straight journalism, I found that the only way to behave and not drive yourself crazy was to not hold yourself responsible for actually fixing anything. It isn't in your job description to fix anything. That doesn't mean I don't believe in the process or hope for the best. I am not a libertarian. I believe in governance. I believe in good governance as being a goal.\n\nIf it's about hangings pelts on my wall, or winning prizes, then it's a game. If it's about telling a story as well as you can, then I have some place to stand on.\n\nI heard that you said, during an event where members of The Wire 's cast read testimonies from Baltimore residents after the death of Freddie Gray, that art or drama or television shows are not appropriate venues for addressing the protests and riots. Rather, journalism is the venue.\n\nThat's a little too broad. What I was saying was, right now, we shouldn't be attenuating our attentions through a television drama. We don't need that right now. At some point someone may find a meaningful drama to explain this moment. If not in Baltimore, then maybe Ferguson or Charleston or somewhere. There is a lot that drama can do, and it certainly has a role. But right now it struck me as being inappropriate, that with all the actual substance of what is happening in the streets right now, in the halls of power right now, we need to be straining this through a drama. Why are you doing that? What was it that made people at various publications and blogs reference The Wire just because it was black people in Baltimore? That's fucked up. It's almost a shrinking of the human mind. Why don't you attend to what's actually happening right now in Baltimore? You don't need McNulty or whoever to access it.\n\nThere is a line from Marx about people seeing foreign things and translating them back into languages they understand.\n\nRight, there were a string of essays: The Wire does explain Baltimore, The Wire doesn't explain Baltimore. And then there were my limited comments about the protests, which I very much supported and wish were more ongoing because I don't think there has been very much systemic change in Baltimore regardless of the indictment of those officers. My concern was the moment it went to burning and looting.\n\nAt that moment I am speaking not as the guy who did The Wire . I am speaking as someone who has covered this stuff for 20 years in Baltimore and lives in Baltimore. That was written in sight of the fires. I am completely indifferent to the notion of white privilege, that I am some rich white writer deigning to give an opinion about what poor black folks should do when one of them dies in the back of a wagon. I am sorry, but if your definition of white privilege now extends to people who have lived in Baltimore for decades and can't say, \"Please don't burn this town down,\" while in the previous breath saying, \"Yes, we need answers, but please don't burn this town down\"-if that's white privilege, then white privilege means nothing.\n\nIt seems like you are expressing annoyance with some of the political dialogue about these issues that-\n\nWhat I am saying is, everything is not The Wire .\n\nWell, wait, are you saying that, or are you saying that there is a way in which this stuff tends to get discussed among people sympathetic to the protests-\n\nNo, I am not saying the second thing. The second thing, by the way, is obvious. It doesn't need saying by me-that there are people on all sides of this issue, that there are people who will excuse any act of violence by citing the desperation of people. Yes, there are people capable of rhetoric going in that way. And there are people who see everyone in the street demanding change as a thug. I don't truck with either of them. But that is not what I am complaining about. You asked me a question about The Wire , right? I am on point to what you asked me about.\n\nI am so used to the people I interview drifting off point that I can't even fathom this.\n\nOK, the actors at the festival were presenting themselves as the cast of The Wire doing something in the wake of The Wire . I was very concerned about that. I say this as someone completely invested in the place. A quarter of our population disappeared after the '68 riots. To be reading people in New York or London or Los Angeles or these first-tier cities, where their economies are so secure ... it's one thing to say they understand the rage, the impulse. It is another thing to say, merely because you label someone burning a liquor store an uprising, it is.\n\nI don't want to suggest that those Wire cast members in Baltimore didn't turn out to do exactly what they should have done: channel the words of Baltimore residents. They used their experience to narrate. And that felt exactly right. What I was cautious about was people feeling the need to strain what happened in Baltimore through a fictional narrative.\n\nI have heard you say that one reason this conversation about Baltimore and other places is happening now is technology: police body cameras, cellphone videos-\n\nAbsolutely, incredibly liberalizing.\n\nRight, so I am wondering how that has affected your view of technology, and-\n\nWhat do you think my view of technology is?\n\nI don't know. That's why I am asking.\n\nOK, I am certainly as impressed with the reach of the pocket camera as everybody else.\n\nRight, I was going to try and connect this with other technological innovations: There has been a lot written by you and others about the decline of local media and newspapers and what that means for cities. But many of these protests have gained traction through social media, and a lot of the anger over police shootings has been fueled by social media.\n\nI certainly think that social media and its initial discoveries, either through raw footage or instantaneous knowledge, can provide much more intake for our media culture. But I know from having examined social media, and its uses, not just as pure information but as that which serves an agenda, that it is not necessarily accurate. The people who are professionals at trying to figure out what the whole story is, or why what's posted might not be exactly what people say-the people who attend to that and force some credibility into the discussion, they have been marginalized.\n\nAt the same time I wouldn't want to go back to a time where a police officer can kick the shit out of a guy in front of five witnesses and if they all have criminal histories, and can be made to look equivocal in front of a grand jury, he gets away with it.\n\nI also covered a lot of cops who, because they were compelled to police an inner city, under the heel of a drug war, they had to get out of a car and clear corners. And when they said a corner was indicted, everybody move along, and one guy looks at you and says, \"Fuck you,\" it's time to fight. A cop who doesn't fight gives up his post for the guy coming after him.\n\nYou have said that a lot of these tactics started with the drug war. Do you think that if the drug war comes to an end in 10 or 15 years-not that it necessarily will, but fingers crossed-\n\nBy the way, I am a little optimistic. I think it is ratcheting down from its extremity. I think it is happening now. Which is why I care so much about the optics of what happened in Baltimore.\n\nSay more.\n\nWhat?\n\nGo on, I mean.\n\nGuys saying, \"Hands up\" or \"I can't breathe\" and shaming the country in some fundamental ways where we start to reassess this dynamic: That to me is incredibly powerful and essential. Ambushing a cop in Ferguson outside a station house, several months ago, is not good. People marching to demand on city hall accountability is incredibly good.\n\nListen, look up the governor of Georgia, a red state. He is closing prisons and releasing nonviolent offenders. If it is happening in Georgia-and it is-then we have reached some sort of terminus. That doesn't mean it has been completely rolled back or that there won't be retrograde moments. But the overreach of this thing-with 2 million people in prison-has finally registered.\n\nAnd I assume you think there is a feedback loop. If this stuff leads to a ratcheting down of the drug war, then a ratcheting down of the drug war might lead to better policing policies.\n\nAt some point, when cops are not charged with enforcing an unenforceable prohibition, when you become an army of occupation, because this is an industry you cannot eradicate, and is employing so many people in areas of our country where real industry has disappeared, once they are not in charge of that, they might get back to the job of actually protecting a neighborhood, even a poor neighborhood, which they have never done. They let the ghettos police themselves. It creates an incredible dystopia. Look at Jill Leovy's book Ghettoside . Her argument is that black communities are underpoliced. This seems to fly in the face of something like Ferguson, but both things are true. When they need cops to do their jobs, they are underpoliced, and when they don't need cops to be battering into neighborhood, that is where they are overpoliced. Both things are true.\n\nDid you read Ta-Nehisi Coates' book?\n\nYeah.\n\nYou guys both have a lot of experience in Baltimore and talk about some of the same issues-\n\nNot the same experience.\n\nCertainly true. I think his book seemed more pessimistic about some of the issues-\n\nI think it is more pessimistic. Listen, it is more pessimistic than my view and I don't think I am ducking any critique here by saying that he's earned that. To this day, knowing everything that police are capable of in my city and elsewhere, when a radio car goes down the street in Baltimore, I don't feel pressure, I don't feel eyes on the back of my neck, and I never will. I grew up a couple miles from where he did, and it just doesn't matter. I grew up in a different America. He is entitled to a wariness that is earned. The most important thing he said in that book is that we-African Americans-cannot fix this. This is your fucking problem. It isn't for us to fix. You may never fix it or confront it.\n\nI would just disagree [with him] about the arc of progress. In my lifetime, I have seen a powerful growth in the viability and social and political import of a black and Latino and Asian middle class that is going to be reckoned with. We are going to reach a point where whites are a plurality and not an automatic majority in every political circumstance. There is a lot of growing up that the country can do behind that. Very quietly, out on the west side of my city, in the suburbs, there is a black middle class that is growing. And we are seeing things challenged correctly now. It is terrifying because everything is one step away from a very destructive riot, but at least it is being talked about and addressed. We are at a place we need to be.\n\n[An HBO employee says that we have time for one more question.]\n\nMight it be about Show Me a Hero ? For fuck's sake. [In  jest.] We did just come out with a miniseries, motherfucker!\n\nI was going to ask you about Martin O'Malley, but I guess I should ask about the show.\n\nYeah you should, you should. Everything I have said about Martin is self-evident. I have already said it.\n\nWhat does this show address that you weren't able to address in your other television work?\n\nTo again echo what Coates wrote, there are certain fundamental things about America that aren't up to African Americans to fix. And what happened in Yonkers is what happened every time, everywhere a white majority is asked to share: to share geographic space, to share political power, to share economic viability. We are not very good at sharing in this country. In fact we are getting worse at it as the libertarian impulse gains traction. It's really disappointing.\n\nEven though what happened in Yonkers was a harbinger of political progress, the political cost was so astounding that there will still be people who look at it and say, \"They shouldn't have tried to do that.\"\n\nBut this [status quo] didn't just happen. Federal money was spent to hypersegregate our society, to make sure that the poor were shoveled into very small areas and that they would grow up in a different America. And when people say, \"Well they shouldn't try [desegregation],\" it's as if the last hundred years never happened, as if we are supposed to start from a magical-\n\nRight-wingers love saying that. Starting now!\n\nYeah, let's not speak to history, let's not speak to intention, let's not speak to federal money. Pay no attention to everything up until this point. Now we just have well-meaning white people and well-meaning black people, and some happen to be poor and some rich, and some happen to live in an America where everything is upside down, and the other half don't. And let's start from there and critique human behavior. It's so juvenile. Being able to speak about what happened in Yonkers is very valuable to me.\n\nAs a well-meaning white person, thanks for doing this interview.\n\n[Laughs].

      "text": "Marlon James' Novels Are Masterpieces. His New HBO Series Achieves Something Similar.\n\nDetective shows are often full of clichés. Arguably, that's one of the things fans like about them, the comfy predictability only occasionally laced with something new. One popular device: Set your murder mystery in a sunny vacation destination-a Caribbean island, the south of France-and slather on the scenery for a combination of whodunit and armchair travel. (The rain-plagued Brits are especially keen on this sort of thing.) But HBO's Get Millie Black , set in Jamaica, is not that kind of show. Created and written by the novelist Marlon James , the five-episode series features no sun-drenched beaches or umbrella-ed cocktails. Instead, the action takes place in the grittiest streets of Kingston, where survival requires every shred of wit, strength, and ruthlessness the city's underclass denizens can summon.\n\nThe title character (Tamara Lawrance)-inspired by James' own mother, a Jamaican detective inspector -carries some of the usual TV-cop baggage. As a girl, Millie tried to defend her little brother Orville (Chyna McQueen) from their abusive mother and as a result got shipped off to England, where she eventually joined the police. Believing Orville to be dead, she returns to Kingston 18 years later after discovering that he's not. Or, rather, that only the name is dead. Orville is now Hibiscus, a transgender sex worker who lives in the Gully, a dry paved canal bed running through the city, and Get Millie Black 's emblem of Jamaica's paradoxes. The Gully is a dangerous place, especially in a city rife with homophobic violence, where same-sex activities are still illegal. But in the Gully Hibiscus also finds a community that means more to her than the suburban house Millie inherits when their mother dies.\n\nMillie's guilt over being forced to abandon Orville makes her a compulsive crusader, intent on saving the lost and vulnerable, particularly children. She and her partner Curtis (Gershwyn Eustache Jnr), a semicloseted gay man, catch a missing person's case-a teenage girl named Janet (Shernet Swearine)-and Millie is instantly hooked. They discover that Janet had been involved with the ne'er-do-well scion of one of Kingston's rich white families, so their investigation takes them on a tour of Jamaica's racial and class caste system. Interfering with their search for the girl is another white man, a Scotland Yard superintendent, Luke Holborn (Joe Dempsie), who wants to turn the rich kid into a witness against the criminal outfits with which he has been dabbling. \"Here to colonize our investigation?\" Millie quips when introduced to Holborn.\n\nThere's a sturdy detective story running through Get Millie Black , but what makes the series stand out is how James uses the form to achieve something similar to his 2014 masterpiece, the Booker Prize-winning A Brief History of Seven Killings . That novel offered a polyphonic portrait of Bob Marley's Jamaica, also enriched with a complex, fraught relationship between two sisters. (No man has any business writing about how sisters talk to and feel about each other as accurately as James does.) Get Millie Black uses voice-over, a device that critics of hard-boiled crime fiction often dismiss as a narrative crutch. In this series, however, a different character voices each episode, revealing aspects of themselves they conceal from one another and the world. Hardly anyone in Millie's orbit is exactly what they seem to be, but their hidden reserves contain much more than ulterior motives and secret agendas. Janet in particular becomes a new girl in almost every scene, yet thanks to Swearine's fierce performance, each new facet remains utterly convincing.\n\nThen there's Millie herself, splendidly played by Lawrance as a mercurial obsessive forever treading on the brink of disaster. The driven detective who pursues truth and justice in defiance of protocol and municipal politics is yet another crime-fiction cliché. As Millie cajoles information out of her former partner back in London, alienates the rich and influential with her blunt questions, and neglects the relationships that ostensibly mean the most to her, she's in familiar TV-cop territory. But viewers used to getting exasperated with the long-suffering wives and dementia-addled parents of TV detectives-characters with the annoying habit of interfering with the unfolding of the plot-may be surprised to find themselves siding with Millie's loved ones for a change.\n\nJames writes Millie as a kind of addict. Butter wouldn't melt in her mouth as she adeptly coaxes the sweet bartender she's been dating into sheltering a witness even though they both know she's putting him in danger. The director of the first two episodes, Tanya Hamilton, takes the time to linger on the faces of the people in Millie's life as the realization lands that she won't hesitate to use them.* She fails to visit her partner in the hospital after he gets shot because she's so intent on proving that their missing-person case leads to a human-trafficking ring. She tries to stash Hibiscus-her reason for returning to Jamaica in the first place-in their late mother's house as if her sister were a precious object to be stored instead of a person desperate to live her own life. Millie has a habit of staring at videos of the trafficking victim she's trying to find whenever her zeal starts to flag-again, typical TV-detective behavior, but Lawrance also conveys that for Millie, the compulsion to rescue is truly a fix.\n\nSo much of Get Millie Black is familiar, but what makes the series fresh is the conviction it brings to the genre's pro forma tropes. TV detectives are forever wrecking their personal lives in their single-minded service to the plot, and rarely does the audience really care. We don't switch on an episode of Law & Order to see detectives eating dinner with their families at a reasonable hour, after all. But most TV detectives' private lives seem well worth sacrificing to feed our appetite for the puzzles they solve. Get Millie Black -with its indelible characters and vivid performances-actually makes you feel how much Millie stands to lose.\n\nCorrection, Dec. 2, 2024: This piece originally misstated that Hamilton directed the entire series.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Thank You, Lee Daniels, for This Crazy Barack Obama Scene From the Latest Episode of Empire\n\nHakeem (Bryshere Gray) in \"The Outspoken King.\"\n\nPhoto by Chuck Hodes.\n\nEven within the stricter confines of network TV, Lee Daniels continues to provoke. His new evening soap opera Empire is, as Slate 's Willa Paskin noted in her review, \" invigoratingly free of anxiety about causing offense .\" And in tonight's episode, Hakeem (Bryshere Gray), the youngest and wildest son of the musical Lyon dynasty, is recorded on camera drunkenly insulting President Obama-a friend of his father, Lucious, played by Terrence Howard-in front of a stunned crowd of mostly white patrons dining at a \"fine establishment.\" He then accuses said patrons of voting for the first black president solely out of white liberal guilt. Oh, and Obama is called a \"sell-out.\" Twice.\n\nIt's a bizarre, though not unrealistic, scene, and it's one that makes me grateful that Daniels-who has co-written 12 episodes, in addition to directing the first two-has brought his brazenness to the small screen at this moment. Whatever your own thoughts about our current president, it's safe to say that much of Hollywood has played it safe when it comes to depicting Obama. Shonda Rhimes, creator of Scandal , made the conscious decision to ignore him entirely and cast a white man as a fictional modern president-Paskin interviewed Rhimes in 2013 for a New York Times Magazine piece and shared with me part of the transcript of their discussion that didn't wind up in print:\n\nI knew that Olivia was going to be African American because Judy [Smith, the loose inspiration for the show] was African American, because it made sense to me. And I knew that Fitz was going to be white because ... I didn't want anybody thinking we were talking about Obama in any way, shape, or form. We've had many, many, many white Presidents and we've only had one black one.\n\nScandal first premiered in the spring of 2012, when Obama was still in his first term. Could Daniels have written such a scene back then and seen it aired on a major network? Would he have? I'm not so sure, but I'm relieved that he can, and did, now. Having a black character openly criticize Obama-at one point, a friend of Hakeem's says, \"That brother ain't even half of a brother, anyway\"-is another way to bring a different point of view, and help break down stereotypes about black people's supposedly blind allegiance to the president. It's a sassy counter to the funny, and increasingly ridiculous, recurring SNL sketch, \" How's He Doing .\" And to have real equality, the first black president should be criticized just like every other president before him.\n\nBut in true Daniels style, Hakeem's outburst is complicated. Hakeem's drunken, at times nonsensical, braggadocio, delivered in front of rich white folks, could be seen as a \"shame\" to his race, making the rest of us black folks \"look bad.\" Even Lucious' ex-wife, Cookie (Taraji P. Henson), chastises him for allowing their son to play a concert after the controversy. \"You're a horrible parent,\" she says. \"How do you let that boy talk all that trash about Barack Obama, and still let him perform?\"\n\nEmpire , thankfully, doesn't slip so easily into the mode of \" respectability politics .\" Even amid the glorious scenery chewing and campy dialogue-the show is basically Douglas Sirk meets Nashville by way of the chitlin' circuit -this is no morality tale. Daniels doesn't pick sides in the debate over Obama's legacy, he simply presents, unfiltered, some of the many ways in which black people view the president. To see a black storyteller on network TV with that much freedom-not just within the entertainment system, but within his own creative mind-is invigorating.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "I grew up thinking journalism was just for rich white people. I was mostly right.\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Joshua Rivera\n\n\"Internships,\" the headline in the New York Times's opinion section read, \"Are Not a Privilege.\" The op-ed was by Darren Walker of the Ford Foundation, and it discussed what he called \"America's internship-industrial complex\" - the way unpaid internships effectually lock out diverse, talented young workers who cannot possibly afford to work for free.\n\nIt got media types talking about journalism's unpaid internship economy and why it's insidious. I figured it's a good opportunity to tell you a little bit about my experience with unpaid internships, because I am, improbably, a member of \"the media,\" and I'm kind of tired about only ever seeing white colleagues sound off about this nonsense whenever a fellow person of color addresses it on a platform as big and white as the New York Times.\n\nIt's a matter of optics: While it is presumptuous to assume my white colleagues are all privileged (they're not), collectively it looks like a bunch of people who have benefited from a messed-up system merely shrugging and saying, Hey, ain't that some bullshit?\n\nAfter five years of working in this field - previously for publications like Fast Company and Entertainment Weekly, currently for GQ and Vulture - I remain confident that the biggest reason I have the career I do can only empirically be called \"dumb luck.\" My parents would call it the grace of God , which honestly feels much more true when you do the math and see how stupid unlikely it all is.\n\nIn between my junior and senior years of college (and oh, man, COLLEGE - another big grace-of-God/dumb luck moment in my life), I took an unpaid internship at Gawker Media. This is something I could only do because my parents - poor, blue-collar Hispanic folk with three other kids to feed after my skinny brown geek ass - bent over backward to stay in Bergen County, New Jersey, in an old-ass apartment building where none of the walls were straight and a fuse blew out if we ever had the hubris to run the microwave and the air conditioning at the same time.\n\nThey crammed the six of us into an apartment meant for four people, because I got into a good magnet high school they wanted me to stay in and because they wanted to be near the family church. They believed faith came first, and they wanted a better life for their children.\n\nEven if they didn't know what that better life looked like. I barely did.\n\nMost bizarre to me was how necessary the school's career development office stressed unpaid internships were\n\nAnyway, my parents were able to keep us in this nice, white New Jersey neighborhood - just a river's width away from the Hispanic neighborhoods where, based on our income and culture, we \"belonged\" - and I went to a high school with a faculty that worked hard to make sure its students all knew everything there was to know about college and internships and that I, specifically, could have those things.\n\nDon't gloss over that last bit. See, I had to be told I could go to college, any college, anywhere, and study anything. Before that, I just assumed it wasn't for me. I would've gone to a community college - Bergen County had a good one - and studied something \"sensible.\" Accounting, or IT. This would have been enough - enough to make everyone proud, enough to help my family out, enough to have a better life than the one my parents led. Sure, I was good at writing, but the hell was I going to do with that? That shit's for white people.\n\nThen I applied to Syracuse University - to the Newhouse School, a school whose reputation I was entirely ignorant of, a school I only knew about because it had partnered with my local paper to bring brown kids like me out there for a weekend to learn what studying journalism was like. I applied because it was the first honest-to-God college campus I had seen with my own eyes and thought, Damn , wouldn't this be nice?\n\nI mentioned applying to Newhouse to a local Syracuse recruiter, and he scoffed at me. \"Oh,\" he said. \"The hard one .\" He then told me about the school's reputation, its relatively low acceptance rate, how I should consider applying to the less stringent College of Arts and Sciences and maybe transferring later.\n\nI got in anyway, and became the first in my family to go to college, on a grant. I wouldn't have been able to attend otherwise. I still think about that guy. I hope he isn't recruiting anymore.\n\nAll of college was a culture shock for me, a surreal experience I never stopped feeling like I wasn't supposed to have. But most bizarre to me was how necessary the school's career development office stressed unpaid internships were, how chill we all were supposed to be with doing immense amounts of entry-level work for free.\n\nThey said a lot of things, but most of what I heard in my head was, Whoa, this shit really is for rich white people . I could not comprehend how I, had I not lived walking distance from a train station minutes away from New York City, would have ever pulled that off. Everywhere, kids were moving to other states to do unpaid gigs for this network or that publication. I was stuck where God planted my ass, and even then it barely worked out.\n\nI applied to an unpaid internship at Gawker's video game blog Kotaku on a lark. Thinking I couldn't possibly get it, I wrote a wise-ass application email I wouldn't have otherwise sent. I got it.\n\nI had to work two other part-time jobs and fight my father tooth and nail to keep it. See, an unpaid internship was foolish to him. He was right, but if I wanted to make the most of this education I was getting, I had to play a game we were never allowed to even see . A game people of our stature didn't have any business playing.\n\nMy pops was just looking out for me, but he was using a math that was meant to keep us where we were. Things got heated. He threw me out the house. Having pissed off the guy who drove me to work, I walked two miles to one of the part-time jobs that paid me money to afford the train tickets to my unpaid gig, furious but hoping he didn't mean it. I came home that night, because of course he didn't.\n\nI never took an unpaid internship again. Didn't have to. A Gawker line on my résumé and Kotaku bylines in my clip file did a lot for me, because media hiring is an image-driven game of six degrees of separation and I had lucked my way into a reason to get people to just look at my writing.\n\nWhen they did, I got to sit in newsrooms populated almost entirely by people who were nothing like me, empowered by a privilege that, until a few years ago, I hadn't even known existed. And they were fine. Nice people who were smart and talented and whom I learned a lot from.\n\nBut they might as well have been from another goddamn planet. And I was writing for them, and people like them. Nobody back home cares about startups, and all the writing and reporting I did for the Hacker News set couldn't be any more removed from the reality of my family's life.\n\nToday, my work is a little more relevant to the lives of the people I grew up around - I write about entertainment - but for publications that serve audiences that are overwhelmingly college-educated, no stranger to this strange machine I've slipped my way into. No one back home knows about Vox.com .\n\nBefore we're done here, I want to tell you about J.\n\nRemember that program I told you about? The one that took me to my alma mater for the first time as a high schooler? I went back last fall -this time as a chaperone, escorting a bus full of bright-eyed brown kids hoping to go to college, be journalists, tell stories.\n\nJ kept to himself most of the trip, a small Latino kid who looked both fiercely intelligent and fiercely committed to hiding it. At one point, something happened to J. He shut down entirely, seemed to hate everything. It took me a whole dinner's worth of shooting the shit about sports and girls to get him to tell me what bothered him. Turned out a current Syracuse student had asked J where he was from, and when J told him, the student was taken aback.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" the prick asked.\n\nAnd so I told J about the quiet fury I've lived with since making it Out, since achieving the dream my grandparents had for us all from the moment they set foot in this country and struck out on their own. I told him that he's going to feel like all this isn't for him, that it's going to feel like he cheated his way in, that he's going to have to endure the casual, painful ignorance that comes from privilege, that he's going to see the casual wealth and opportunity of all the nice white people around him and feel like he can't possibly have a chance to compete.\n\nJournalism speaks for those who cannot. It is the clear, level voice broadcasting the message of people with voices too raw from shouting on their own for far too long. And journalism is doing it half-blind.\n\nAnd then I told him how far he's come just by sitting in that dining hall with me, about how many of us don't even get to know what that's like , that, yes, the game is rigged, but our very presence brings it a little bit closer to being overturned entirely. How he's going to prove to the world that it's wrong, that he can't be kept down.\n\nBecause that's what all of it does, somehow - prestigious degrees from private universities, alumni networks, unpaid internships, and stupid, ignorant comments from the beneficiaries thereof: keep kids like J out.\n\nBack in New Jersey, as the kids all got off the bus we took upstate and into their parents' cars, J came over to me and shook my hand. Told me that conversation made a trip he would've otherwise written off entirely worth it. I hope he meant it. I hope he's out there, applying to schools, schools that he's been conditioned to think aren't for him. Causing trouble. Like a journalist.\n\nJournalism has been making headway in areas that help bolster newsroom diversity, that will help kids like J - unpaid internships are virtually extinct at major publications, and editors are slowly working toward making their roster of writers less homogeneous. But journalism is also hamstrung. Dependent on advertisers and their customers or on the fickle, unknowable workings of a social media algorithm .\n\nThis is a problem that is bigger than journalism, but it's one that is paramount for journalism to solve. Journalism speaks for those who cannot. It is the clear, level voice broadcasting the message of people with voices too raw from shouting on their own for far too long. And journalism is doing it half-blind.\n\nI don't ever want to have the kind of conversation I had with J again. I want it to be unnecessary sometime in my lifetime, and soon. But I know it won't be. The problem is too big, involving too many institutional policies and systemic injustices to be solved anytime soon. Change is slow, and I am young. But that's okay. I'll keep having those conversations. Keep on swinging.\n\nBecause despite media's best efforts, I'm media now.\n\nJoshua Rivera is a freelance entertainment journalist and critic whose work has appeared in Fast Company, Business Insider, the Daily Beast, and Entertainment Weekly.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nBoth were filmed in Covid-19 bubbles, and both are about going on vacation in a world slipping into the sea.\n\nby Emily St. James\n\nAround halfway through director M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie Old , Maddox, played by Thomasin McKenzie, has just begun to realize the weight of what has happened to her.\n\nWhile on vacation with her parents and younger brother, Maddox went to the beach as an 11-year-old (at which point, she was played by a different actor). But this beach ages people at the rate of roughly one year per half-hour. Pretty soon, she's a teenager. As the day passes, she progresses through her 20s and 30s. (McKenzie takes over the role about 30 minutes into the film, when Maddox is 16, then plays her for most of the rest of the movie.)\n\nMaddox is a problem solver, as so many eldest children are. She begins to pace on the sand, insisting to herself that she must keep it together. But she can't stop thinking about all she's lost, an 11-year-old in a young adult's body. Prom, graduation, college - they're all slipping away in a matter of hours. Her world is collapsing beneath her.\n\nOld is full of kids like Maddox, kids who've assumed their lives will always be safe and predictable, only to suddenly learn they're anything but on the beach that makes you old. One kid tells his friend they'll be best friends forever, until they both live next door to each other and have mortgages. Another kid, now a teenager thanks to the beach, gets pregnant; neither she nor the boy who impregnated her have any idea how it happened. Even Shyamalan's camera gets in on the action, doing long pans across the beach from one position to another. Each time it returns to its starting point, something has changed or new information has appeared in the frame, often unpredictably. The message is always the same: Something safe has failed us. The world is falling apart.\n\nOld is a movie about how parents are rendered inadequate and helpless when faced with the task of preparing their children for a world that stops making sense. It is also one of the first wide-release movies to have been filmed entirely in the middle of a pandemic-imposed bubble , and the existential terror of a year in quarantine informs almost every moment of the movie.\n\nThe film is not the only recent release to embrace this thematic sensibility. Another, similar project, HBO's limited TV series The White Lotus , currently airing on Sundays, also takes place in a tropical setting drenched with omens of something dark and terrible just over the horizon. Old is a horror movie; The White Lotus is a social satire. They're still weirdly in conversation.\n\nBoth Old and The White Lotus were produced under similar Covid-19 safety protocols (an isolated location, a small cast of actors, lots of filming outdoors). Both are informed by their respective filming bubbles, and both are also interested in the ways the world feels a little less \"normal\" with every day. Both are soaked through with pre-apocalyptic dread, and both prominently feature an ocean that looms in the background, occasionally sweeping a smartphone away or washing a dead body onto the shore. It's not that far a stretch to suggest those moments are provoked by anxiety over rising sea levels.\n\nOld and The White Lotus are convinced we live in a world that is falling apart, both broadly (nothing makes sense anymore!) and more granularly (the planet is heating up!). They both serve to underline how there's very little we can do about any of it.\n\nOld and The White Lotus might seem to have very little in common, beyond a tropical setting and the fact that they both feature dead bodies.\n\nThe former is a horror movie from a love-or-hate director whose career has become emblematic of big twist endings and overwrought dialogue. The latter is an acidic social satire set at a Hawaiian resort whose many guests have gathered for a variety of reasons - a family getaway, a honeymoon, a mourning ritual. It's written and directed by Mike White, of Enlightened fame, who is one of television's best observers of rich white people's blind spots and idiosyncrasies. The former is an overblown B-movie. The latter is akin to an American Renoir film , complete with all the class warfare you could hope for.\n\nThat's where their production commonalities factor in. Old and The White Lotus were both filmed in the midst of the pandemic, in complete production lockdowns. By replicating the rhythms of a vacation and traveling to a singular destination, then quarantining and establishing a Covid-19 bubble, each could limit who was on and off the set, simply thanks to geography. Shyamalan went so far as to rent an entire resort in the Dominican Republic so that his cast and crew could remain isolated from the world at large. The White Lotus filmed at the Four Seasons resort in Maui, with the hotel completely closed to the public for much of production.\n\nOld had been greenlit in 2019, but it didn't begin shooting until September of 2020; production wrapped in November. HBO actually approached White in mid-2020 to ask if he could construct a story that could be filmed in a single location very quickly, to facilitate production during lockdown. He began shooting The White Lotus in October of 2020 and was done by the end of the year. At the time, Hawaii had seen very limited Covid-19 cases; Maui County has had just under 5,500 Covid-19 cases ever.\n\nIf you poke at the seams of Old and The White Lotus , you can see how they were each designed to accommodate pandemic safety concerns. Both have extremely limited casts of characters, neither of which expands that much throughout their respective stories. Both feature a lot of scenes filmed outdoors or on large, open-air patios. Both are set at resorts, which are reasonably easy to lock down, provided you're willing to buy out the whole place - a much easier prospect during a global event that has enormously diminished world travel.\n\nBoth stories are also informed by pandemic-era sensitivities and share a deep-seated claustrophobia common to works predominantly set in a single location. The people on the beach in Old cannot escape said beach, and the people at the resort in The White Lotus don't seem to want to leave the resort. Everybody's trapped, usually with their families and a random assortment of strangers, like in your average quarantine-era apartment building. Children, left unsupervised, get into trouble on their own, and their parents are too exhausted or apathetic to do anything about it. Everybody gets into arguments about just how fucked they are.\n\nThe existential dread present in Old is more obvious, and more immediate. \"We are going to die here!\" has a bit more urgency to it when you're on a beach that ages you rapidly than when you're simply muddling through life on a planet that is killing you and everyone you know very, very slowly. Yet it's not hard to look at both projects and compare them to the sandcastle that two characters build near the end of Old , or the smartphone one character loses to the ocean in The White Lotus . Everything we do and everything we have is impermanent. The earth is finding new ways to remind us of that every day.\n\nThe global uncertainty that defined 2020 underscored and highlighted a question plenty of prospective parents are asking right now: Is it unethical to bring a child into a world that is crumbling? Or is having children an essential act of hope for the future? People have continued to have babies in far more dire situations than the one we're currently in. Why would we stop now?\n\nStill - if things keep getting worse, have you just brought a child into a world that will increasingly become uninhabitable? What happens when you bring your kids to a place where the rules you grew up with no longer hold sway? How do you cope with the idea that the world might fall apart to such a degree that they won't have a prom, a graduation, a college education? What if it comes to that?\n\nThere are, of course, billions of people on the planet for whom horrible instability has always been a given, but the awful, democratizing effect of both Covid-19 and climate change is that their horrors are somewhat more evenly spread across the species. While the horrors that Covid-19 inflicted on privileged people around the globe have been far less cataclysmic than those inflicted on everybody else , everyone is affected by it at least a little bit, and climate change seems likely to follow a similar template.\n\nScience-fiction writer Charlie Jane Anders recently wrote in her newsletter about just how much her fear of climate change's effects on humanity has bled into her writing. She also observed, however, that there can be something healing in acknowledging that fear.\n\nI'm honestly terrified of what's coming, and the fact that we're already starting to live through heat waves and superstorms and (maybe) zoonotic diseases doesn't do anything to make the future climate disruption less scary. At all. We are going to suffer, all of us, in ways we've barely wrapped our heads around so far. And yet, I don't think fiction about climate change needs to be disaster porn, or pure misery, or something engineered to \"scare us straight.\" At all. A lot of my work on climate change is about surviving and adapting.\n\nThe trick of being alive right now is pretending that everything we're doing still matters. There is abundant evidence that nothing might be as important as humans banding together in a last-ditch effort to slow the effects of climate change, such that the planet might continue to support life as we know it. Whatever anxiety Covid-19 has provoked, including in so many artists, feels like an appetizer for the main course.\n\n\"We're still parasites on the Earth!\" one character exclaims in The White Lotus , hoping to underline the hypocrisy of his family members, who are squabbling about the right way to organize society. They all know he's right; they also are powerless to stop being parasites. They are the super-rich, and they are loath to change their ways because it's easier to be comfortable than to do something difficult but right. Old touches on this idea as well, in a moment I dare not spoil here. Both works are very interested in the ways in which unchecked capitalism has contributed to the state of the world, past, present, and future, but The White Lotus , in particular, is excoriating about the upper classes.\n\nThe 2020s might very well become a decade of art forged in paranoia and anxiety at the thought of a warming climate that is outpacing our ability or willingness to act before it's too late. But art that is terrified about a slowly building apocalypse isn't a new phenomenon. The 1920s were filled with art set in beautiful baubles of decadence that felt uneasily gleeful ( or deeply traumatized ) in the wake of World War I and the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. The 1950s and '60s were rife with art terrified by the seeming inevitability of nuclear war . We imagine our apocalypses in great detail, perhaps in hopes that we can avert them in reality.\n\nThat sense of looming apocalypse is what most unites Old and The White Lotus in the end. Old suggests that at least some of us might find a way out of our current series of existential threats; The White Lotus isn't so sure. But for as attuned as both works are to this particular moment in time, they also have one eye on what has always been true: We're always heading toward an ending of some sort. Every beach you visit makes you older by virtue of the time you spend there, just not as quickly as the beach in Old . The planet is going to get you eventually.\n\nEverything we do is impermanent, regardless of whether we halt climate change. Centuries from now, if humanity exists, no one will be talking about Old or The White Lotus or this article discussing the two. People will have new concerns and new thoughts to ponder through their art. The things that are permanent - or at least as close to permanent as our conceptions of time will allow - are the ocean and the sand and the endless chain of life that stretches behind and beyond us. Having a child right now is a tremendous act of faith that things might turn out okay in the end, but having a child is always a tremendous act of faith. The world is always ending, and it's always beginning, too. You have to make your peace with that somehow.\n\nOr, to put it more bluntly, as one character says after watching a whale surface in the ocean in The White Lotus : \"What the fuck?\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Also, clowns!\n\nby Caroline Framke\n\nWhen American Horror Story has something to say, it doesn't just say it. It douses its message in gasoline, drops a match, and leans forward leering, \"DO YOU GET IT NOW?\"\n\nAmerican Horror Story: Cult follows in that tradition, but this time, the FX horror anthology is bringing its metaphorical sledgehammer down on politics. Whether Cult is trying to scare viewers or make them laugh, it's never subtle about it.\n\nThe latest installment of Ryan Murphy's horror franchise - which premieres September 5 with \"Election Night\" - isn't exactly good , but it is undeniably fascinating. The show was, after all, one of the first to not only be developed after Donald Trump was elected president, but to be specifically about Donald Trump being elected president. It zeroes in on one rich Michigan suburb imploding in the wake of the 2016 election, examining a microcosm of the boiling tensions now scalding the country, and promises to spare no one under its microscope.\n\nVox Rating:\n\n2.5 out of 5\n\nAll the while, American Horror Story maintains its signature commitment to keeping horror weird . Sarah Paulson's character, for instance, is haunted by clowns who are probably very real serial killers, but her wife Ivy (Allison Pill) is almost as concerned about her voting for Jill Stein in a swing state. Meanwhile, Evan Peters plays a blue-haired anarchist who's so excited about the election results that he instinctively humps the TV announcing Trump's victory, before launching his own plans to take over the town he feels has disrespected him for too long.\n\nDespite a brief callback to its Carnival season's homicidal clown Twisty, Cult won't be trafficking in any supernatural mysteries - which marks a first for American Horror Story . On Cult , all the villains are human. All the horror comes from the fractured, sparking minds of people lost in paranoia and bone deep terror of what other humans are capable of - and, significantly, so does a lot of the humor, strewn throughout the show like its many wandering clowns.\n\nCult tries hard to straddle the line between horror and satire, and to be both relevant and shocking in its relevance. The end result half-succeeds, swerving between exaggerated satire and eye-rolling drama. It makes for some messy TV, funny and bizarre and uncomfortable to watch - which, to be fair, is exactly how Murphy and Horror Story tend to like it.\n\nAs the town's resident chaos fanatic Kai (Peters) is taking cues from Trump to prey on everyone's insecurities for power, the rest of Cult 's regular characters are rich white liberals spinning out in their desperation to understand this new reality.\n\nPaulson's conflicted character Ally (get it?) is a purposeful embodiment of the privileged liberal of Trump voter nightmares. She's rich, married to a woman, and won't believe the election results until she hears it from Rachel Maddow. (\"She's the only one I trust!\") But she's also chronically paranoid and fighting her debilitating clown phobia, which at one point manifests itself in a nightmare supermarket sequence that finds her brandishing a bottle of rosé at two clowns having sex on the fruit display. ( American Horror Story gonna American Horror Story !)\n\nAt moments like this, or the one where Ally and Ivy's new babysitter Winter (Billie Lourd) blasts CNN for not issuing a trigger warning when it announced Trump's victory, Cult 's satire is as bluntly effective as dropping an encyclopedia on an ant; it proves particularly effective when they get judgmental new neighbors played by sharp comedic actors Billy Eichner and Leslie Grossman (who long ago worked with Murphy on the viciously funny Popular ).\n\nAll this material provides some of the most overtly funny moments the show's ever had - turns out it can work great as one of Murphy's black comedies - and makes clear that these people are ones the creative team knows how to lampoon. The jokes at the expense of white liberals are as pointed as they are obvious, from Winter mourning the fact that getting retweeted by Lena Dunham (a future Cult guest star) wasn't enough for her to help elect the first woman president, to Ally screaming and sobbing about \"what's going to happen to Merrick Garland?!\" (Paulson does a lot of screaming and sobbing this season.)\n\nAnd when Ally starts revealing how shallow her concern for people other than herself truly is, and how she was convinced the world \"righted itself\" when \"Barack\" was elected, her gobsmacked words have a slicing edge that indicts her obliviousness - but it's also a little tricky to know whether the show realizes that's what it's doing.\n\nHaving watched three episodes of Cult , I'm not altogether clear just how self-aware the show is. It knows that Kai is an opportunistic predator; it knows that Ally's a hypocrite. But especially when it comes to Ally, the show's clearest protagonist, it seems less sure about what those characterizations mean, and if they're even fair.\n\nAlly's phobias, prejudices, and declarations that she has a reason to be exactly this paranoid tend to end with her being in the right. Sure, she's losing her mind, the show says, but if you're not, are you even paying attention? Ally is, in other words, waking up to the reality that her world is a whole lot more complicated and ugly than she or anyone around her dared to believe.\n\nThat could be a powerful statement, especially as the show keeps trying to shine a light on how people grab power (see: Kai's fear-mongering) and grapple with forces outside their control (see: Ally's desperation). But every time American Horror Story attempts to imbue real, pressing fear into these statements, in the way that good horror often can - think of this year's Get Out , for example - it also gets ... well, dumb, in a way I'm not certain the show realizes.\n\nThere's nothing particularly clever or scary about Kai warning that \"there is nothing more dangerous in this world than a humiliated man,\" or Ally shrieking \"fuck you, Nate Silver!\" into the night. If dumb moments like these are self-aware, they're at least dumb fun . If they're not, it's far too obvious writing that feels a lot like Cult attempting to claim insight by sole virtue of its subject matter.\n\nSo as with many Murphy projects, I found myself squinting at my screen throughout Cult trying to figure out exactly how much this show is trying to hold a mirror up to itself - or its audience - versus smashing the mirror so as to impress everyone with its sheer force.\n\nThis is nothing new for American Horror Story, which has often luxuriated in its own aesthetics and daring, rather than trying to tell a compelling story. But the show's \"let's just throw shit at the wall and see what sticks\" instinct gets a lot more complicated - and frankly, weirder in a distracting way - when it's applied to something as immediate and relatable as our culture's own fraying reality.\n\nAmerican Horror Story airs Tuesdays at 10 pm Eastern time on FX.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

A deep dive and a bit of detective work led the Emory University law professor to her answer: The federal tax code does favor married couples where one partner makes the lion's share of income; it disfavors those with more of an even split. The former scenario has historically been more common for white couples, the latter for Black couples, including Brown's parents. Her father, James, was a plumber, and her mother, Dottie, a seamstress and nurse, and they made similar amounts of money.\n\n\"My parents' tax bill was so high because they were married to each other. Marriage-which many conservatives assure us is the road out of black poverty-is in fact making Black couples poorer,\" Brown writes in her new book, The Whiteness of Wealth: How the Tax System Impoverishes Black Americans-and How We Can Fix It .\n\nVox's German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration's burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday .\n\nThe first time Brown heard her mother breathe the word \"reparations\" was after she read Brown's chapter about taxes and marriage. \"I have never heard my mother use the 'R-word,'\" Brown recounted in an interview with Vox. \"She was so upset, because she knows how hard she and my father tried to save and how hard it was.\"\n\nBrown's book, published in March, lays out a compelling case that the tax code is stacked in favor of white Americans and against Black Americans in myriad ways - in housing , education , work, investing, and inheritance - using both data and anecdotes from her family and others. (For a while in the drafting process, the book was focused on the Obamas, but she later scrapped the idea.) She argues it's all played a role in the disturbingly persistent racial wealth gap, where the median white family in the US has eight times the net worth of the median Black family.\n\n\"I wrote the book so Black people could understand how screwed up the system was, that they weren't winning because of any fault of their own,\" she said. The task wasn't an easy one, in large part because the IRS doesn't publish tax data by race - something the Bronx-born Brown says must change. \"When we start talking about tax reform, we have to include a racial analysis. We have to connect racial inequality to tax policy.\"\n\nVox recently spoke with Brown about the way color has helped white people get richer in America's economy and tax policy's role in it. She also talked about policy fixes she does and doesn't believe would make the tax code fairer (Brown would like to do a sort of backdoor form of reparations through taxes and is skeptical of many progressive housing proposals) and what Black and white Americans can do to help in the meantime. \"A lot of white Americans blame Black Americans for their state. They think, 'I pulled myself up by my bootstraps,'\" she said. \"Well, no, you really didn't.\"\n\nOur conversation, edited for length and clarity, is below:\n\nOne of the last times I talked to you, it was about Donald Trump's tax returns and revelations about how little he paid in taxes. But what you said to me at the time was that tax advantages weren't really a Donald Trump thing - they are a white, wealthy thing. How is the tax code stacked in white people's favor?\n\nSo let's take marriage. We have this thing called a joint return that we got because a rich white couple wanted to pay less in taxes before we had a joint return. They filed a tax return that wasn't legitimate. The IRS said you can't do that. They filed suit, it went all the way to the Supreme Court, and they won. [The case was Poe v. Seaborn , where the Court ruled in 1930 that a Washington man named H.G. Seaborn, who worked for a shipping company, and his wife, Charlotte, who was a stay-at-home spouse, could split his income jointly on their tax return because they lived in a \" community-property state .\" Years later, in 1948, Congress created the ability for married couples to file joint returns everywhere.] And as a result of that, eventually, Congress passed the joint return provisions.\n\nWhat that does is it gives a tax cut to married couples where one person contributes all or almost all of the total household income. And in 1948, when this came into being, about 85 percent of white married couples had that kind of marriage. But Black Americans did not - the typical Black American marriage is one where both spouses contribute roughly equal amounts. So the joint return vision was never designed with Black Americans in mind, it was designed with white Americans in mind, because Black wives have always worked more in the paid labor market than white wives. [To be clear, married couples have the option of filing their taxes separately.]\n\n\"The joint return vision was never designed with Black Americans in mind, it was designed with white Americans in mind, because Black wives have always worked more in the paid labor market than white wives\"\n\nAnd this is something that happened to your parents, right?\n\nI was doing their tax returns and my tax returns, and something wasn't adding up in my head. I should have been paying a lot more taxes than they were, and I wasn't and didn't understand why. It wasn't until I became an academic, years later, that I figured it out. They were paying too much in taxes because they were paying a marriage penalty because they were married to each other and they made roughly equal amounts.\n\nWhat about housing?\n\nIf you sell your home for more than you paid for it, you can make up to $500,000 from the sale tax-free if you're married and $250,000 if you're single. If you sell your home at a loss, you can't take a deduction.\n\nAnd all of this has ramifications today - when people live in heavily white neighborhoods, the value of their house goes up; when they live in more diverse neighborhoods, that's often not the case.\n\nWe have a 21st-century racist housing market that is built on preferences of white homeowners who are the majority of homebuyers, and white homeowners prefer to live in homogeneous white neighborhoods - that's the homes they value the most. Research shows , the higher the percentage of Black neighbors, the lower the value of the house.\n\nSo who's most likely to get up to half a million dollars of tax gains? Married white homeowners who live in virtually all-white neighborhoods. Who's most likely to sell a home at a loss that's, let's recall, not deductible? Black Americans, Black homeowners who live in racially diverse or all-Black neighborhoods.\n\nWe still have tax subsidies subsidizing white homeownership in ways it's not subsidizing Black homeownership.\n\nOne of the things that you get into in the book is that we don't really know what's happening, race-wise, in taxes because the IRS doesn't say. It doesn't release that data. So how have you been able to figure out what's going on?\n\nThat was the first wake-up call: The IRS doesn't collect and publish statistics by race. I had to become a detective.\n\nAnything I read that had race statistics I would look at through tax eyes. I saw this statistic in a 1990 US Commission on Civil Rights report that said the typical Black wife contributes 40 percent of household income and the typical white wife contributes 29 percent. That probably meant nothing to anybody else who read the report, but to me, it was tax gold, because that told me that Black married couples are more likely to pay a high marriage penalty. That's why my parents were paying so much in taxes. So it taught me to look for a proxy.\n\n\"We have a 21st-century racist housing market that is built on preferences of white homeowners\"\n\nOne person you talk about in the book is a white woman in her 60s named Susan who has managed to build a multimillion-dollar fortune in part because of some luck with stocks. She bought a single McDonald's stock years ago that she's made some $60,000 on, and through some friends got some guy to teach her about the market and learned to invest. Susan, like all of the white people in your book, didn't want their last name to be used in the book. What did you make of that?\n\nThey said they didn't want their family to be associated with this, they didn't really want to talk about their privilege for attribution. And to me, it's just a function of privilege. White people are vested in us not knowing the advantages that they have, because it then becomes a conversation about merit and hard work, and not luck and who my parents were, which are things we can't control.\n\nA lot of white Americans blame Black Americans for their state. They think, \"I pulled myself up by my bootstraps.\" Well, no, you really didn't. A friend of a friend taught you the stock market - that's not pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. So it keeps the meritocracy myth going. Part of what I want the book to do is to help white Americans who want to be allies decide to start talking about their fortune, their luck, and their family financial transfers.\n\nWhat are some policy solutions you think would address these issues?\n\nThe first thing is that the IRS has to start publishing statistics by race, period, full stop. That's number one. When we start talking about tax reform, we have to include a racial analysis. We have to connect racial inequality to tax policy.\n\nWhat my ideal tax system would be, which would not advantage white people or disadvantage Black people, is one where pretty much all income is taxed under the same progressive rate system; we get rid of these deductions and exclusions that are overwhelmingly benefiting white Americans. And then we would create one deduction - I call it a living allowance - that's based on what you would need to live in the geographical area you're in. It's not minimum wage, because in many places, that's not enough, but it's what you would need to live. Any amount in excess of that, you would pay tax at the progressive tax rate. Any amount below that, the government sends your check. You can make an analogy to an expanded earned income tax credit.\n\nAnd then I want to compensate Black Americans for all the decades of higher taxes we've paid. My ideal would be a reparations tax credit; unfortunately, the Supreme Court would find that unconstitutional [because the tax code's discriminatory impact alone would likely not be able to sway the Court, and proving the explicit intent to make Black taxpayers pay more would be difficult]. So my next best alternative would be a wealth tax credit that would apply to any taxpayer, regardless of race, that was in a household with below-median wealth. And that's going to disproportionately benefit Black Americans because of the racial wealth gap. Another way to look at it is that people are talking about a wealth tax. I look at it from the other end - I want to put money in the hands of low-wealth households.\n\nAnd you're critical of some of the proposals already out there. Can you talk about some and what you think they're getting wrong?\n\nSo take the baby bonds proposal [which gives children a savings account and puts money into it depending on the family's income]. I don't like it tied to income, I want it tied to wealth. When it's tied to income, you will exclude six-figure-income Black Americans who have virtually no wealth. Research shows that college-educated Black Americans are more likely to be sending home money to their parents; they can't save the way their white peers can.\n\nI am skeptical of all homeownership programs, because they are encouraging Black people to spend money in a racist market that the only way we get our money out is if we live in an all-white neighborhood. That subjects us to neighbors calling the cops, to fighting with school officials when they tag our children as unruly for the exact same behavior as white kids.\n\nIn Richard Rothstein's The Color of Law , a great book, he takes the hypothetical example of Levittown, New York, which has a history of race discrimination and high wealth - you're making money if you buy a home in Levittown. He says he would want several homes there to be bought by the government and basically transferred to Black Americans with some built-in wealth so that they could be on the path of having homeownership work for them the way it does for white people. What that proposal ignores is the folks in Levittown live in Levittown, in part, because there are very few Black people there. If you sold the next X number of homes to Black people, they would leave. Bye-bye, wealth. It ignores the current-day racist behavior of white homeowners. A lot of proposals on the left around homeownership do the same thing.\n\nHaving said that, the median wealth of a Black homeowner is significantly higher than the median wealth of a renter. I get that homeownership helps Black Americans build wealth. But it doesn't really solve the racial wealth gap, because we are buying homes in neighborhoods that don't appreciate.\n\nBeyond policy proposals, in the meantime, what can Black people do to try to navigate the system as it exists?\n\nBe intentional. If you're going to get married, don't get married on New Year's Eve, get married on January 1, so that you can delay not getting a tax cut one more year. If you want to buy a home in a racially diverse or all-Black neighborhood, do not be house-poor, do not put all of your money into a house. And whatever you do, do not take out home equity loans. If you want to make your home a good financial investment, then buy in an all-white neighborhood. In that neighborhood, you can stretch, you can be house-poor, but recognize you're going to have to engage in what I call \"racism triage.\" You're going to have to deal with some things you wouldn't have to deal with if you'd lived in the all-Black or racially diverse neighborhood.\n\nSay you buy a house in a racially diverse neighborhood and you're not house-poor, so you have extra money. Where do you put it? I would tell you to make sure you max out on your retirement account. If you have children, think about starting a 529 college savings account and investing some in the stock market. If you work for an employer that has a retirement account and can't afford it right away, what about when you get a raise? This is a lesson my mother taught me: You didn't have the money the day before you got the raise; once you get the raise, put the raise in your retirement account.\n\nI wrote the book so Black people could understand how screwed up the system was, that they weren't winning because of any fault of their own, and that there are ways to be a defensive player until we fix the system.\n\n\"When you talk about tax, it's very abstract if you don't show how it actually shows up in somebody's life\"\n\nSo what about white people who are looking at this and thinking, how can I be a good ally here?\n\nWhite Americans ought to argue for getting tax return statistics by race. You should support individual filings, because for all these decades, white Americans' taxes went down. Well, it's only fair that that not continue off the backs of Black people. Be intentional about where you buy a house. Do you want to buy a house in an all-white neighborhood and say I'm an ally? Or do you want to make a different choice? White Americans who live in gentrifying neighborhoods, how do you interact when you arrive in the neighborhood? Do you decide to take it over?\n\nHow can you game the system to help Black people? Where do you send your child to college; what are the graduation rates for Black students? Are they equal? Are they not equal? Does that matter to you? Do you want to agitate? Those of you writing checks to not-for-profit institutions, what are you asking for in return? Do you want to get a building named after you? Shouldn't you also want to see that Black students are thriving there?\n\nIf at a company you're a manager, make sure you pay white employees and Black employees at the same level the same amount. When you negotiate a hiring package, let's say the last person you hired was white and they got five things, and now the person you're negotiating with is Black and they don't ask for those five things. Give them the five things.\n\nOne of the things that really struck me with this book was that you told the story through families, including your own, to explain what's going on. Why choose this approach?\n\nWhen you talk about tax, it's very abstract if you don't show how it actually shows up in somebody's life. So for me, talking about the stories helps the reader understand the importance of this dull policy I'm about to describe. Suddenly it's not so dull. It's, oh, my gosh, that's hurting the Browns, that's hurting the Alexanders. That's why I wanted to tell the story. And it was my parents' tax return that started me, subconsciously, on this road to begin with. My parents should get all the credit for my 25 years of research because it was their puzzle that was driving me crazy.\n\nAt the close of the book, you talk about your mother, Dottie's, reaction to reading your chapter on the marriage penalty, saying for the first time you'd heard that she felt she and your father were owed reparations. What's her reaction been to all of this?\n\nI have never heard my mother use the \"R-word.\" And I looked at my phone and thought, well, go, Miss Dottie! She was so upset, because she knows how hard she and my father tried to save and how hard it was. She was just like, \"I can't believe they did this. Somebody has to fix it.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nBoth were filmed in Covid-19 bubbles, and both are about going on vacation in a world slipping into the sea.\n\nby Emily St. James\n\nAround halfway through director M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie Old , Maddox, played by Thomasin McKenzie, has just begun to realize the weight of what has happened to her.\n\nWhile on vacation with her parents and younger brother, Maddox went to the beach as an 11-year-old (at which point, she was played by a different actor). But this beach ages people at the rate of roughly one year per half-hour. Pretty soon, she's a teenager. As the day passes, she progresses through her 20s and 30s. (McKenzie takes over the role about 30 minutes into the film, when Maddox is 16, then plays her for most of the rest of the movie.)\n\nMaddox is a problem solver, as so many eldest children are. She begins to pace on the sand, insisting to herself that she must keep it together. But she can't stop thinking about all she's lost, an 11-year-old in a young adult's body. Prom, graduation, college - they're all slipping away in a matter of hours. Her world is collapsing beneath her.\n\nOld is full of kids like Maddox, kids who've assumed their lives will always be safe and predictable, only to suddenly learn they're anything but on the beach that makes you old. One kid tells his friend they'll be best friends forever, until they both live next door to each other and have mortgages. Another kid, now a teenager thanks to the beach, gets pregnant; neither she nor the boy who impregnated her have any idea how it happened. Even Shyamalan's camera gets in on the action, doing long pans across the beach from one position to another. Each time it returns to its starting point, something has changed or new information has appeared in the frame, often unpredictably. The message is always the same: Something safe has failed us. The world is falling apart.\n\nOld is a movie about how parents are rendered inadequate and helpless when faced with the task of preparing their children for a world that stops making sense. It is also one of the first wide-release movies to have been filmed entirely in the middle of a pandemic-imposed bubble , and the existential terror of a year in quarantine informs almost every moment of the movie.\n\nThe film is not the only recent release to embrace this thematic sensibility. Another, similar project, HBO's limited TV series The White Lotus , currently airing on Sundays, also takes place in a tropical setting drenched with omens of something dark and terrible just over the horizon. Old is a horror movie; The White Lotus is a social satire. They're still weirdly in conversation.\n\nBoth Old and The White Lotus were produced under similar Covid-19 safety protocols (an isolated location, a small cast of actors, lots of filming outdoors). Both are informed by their respective filming bubbles, and both are also interested in the ways the world feels a little less \"normal\" with every day. Both are soaked through with pre-apocalyptic dread, and both prominently feature an ocean that looms in the background, occasionally sweeping a smartphone away or washing a dead body onto the shore. It's not that far a stretch to suggest those moments are provoked by anxiety over rising sea levels.\n\nOld and The White Lotus are convinced we live in a world that is falling apart, both broadly (nothing makes sense anymore!) and more granularly (the planet is heating up!). They both serve to underline how there's very little we can do about any of it.\n\nOld and The White Lotus might seem to have very little in common, beyond a tropical setting and the fact that they both feature dead bodies.\n\nThe former is a horror movie from a love-or-hate director whose career has become emblematic of big twist endings and overwrought dialogue. The latter is an acidic social satire set at a Hawaiian resort whose many guests have gathered for a variety of reasons - a family getaway, a honeymoon, a mourning ritual. It's written and directed by Mike White, of Enlightened fame, who is one of television's best observers of rich white people's blind spots and idiosyncrasies. The former is an overblown B-movie. The latter is akin to an American Renoir film , complete with all the class warfare you could hope for.\n\nThat's where their production commonalities factor in. Old and The White Lotus were both filmed in the midst of the pandemic, in complete production lockdowns. By replicating the rhythms of a vacation and traveling to a singular destination, then quarantining and establishing a Covid-19 bubble, each could limit who was on and off the set, simply thanks to geography. Shyamalan went so far as to rent an entire resort in the Dominican Republic so that his cast and crew could remain isolated from the world at large. The White Lotus filmed at the Four Seasons resort in Maui, with the hotel completely closed to the public for much of production.\n\nOld had been greenlit in 2019, but it didn't begin shooting until September of 2020; production wrapped in November. HBO actually approached White in mid-2020 to ask if he could construct a story that could be filmed in a single location very quickly, to facilitate production during lockdown. He began shooting The White Lotus in October of 2020 and was done by the end of the year. At the time, Hawaii had seen very limited Covid-19 cases; Maui County has had just under 5,500 Covid-19 cases ever.\n\nIf you poke at the seams of Old and The White Lotus , you can see how they were each designed to accommodate pandemic safety concerns. Both have extremely limited casts of characters, neither of which expands that much throughout their respective stories. Both feature a lot of scenes filmed outdoors or on large, open-air patios. Both are set at resorts, which are reasonably easy to lock down, provided you're willing to buy out the whole place - a much easier prospect during a global event that has enormously diminished world travel.\n\nBoth stories are also informed by pandemic-era sensitivities and share a deep-seated claustrophobia common to works predominantly set in a single location. The people on the beach in Old cannot escape said beach, and the people at the resort in The White Lotus don't seem to want to leave the resort. Everybody's trapped, usually with their families and a random assortment of strangers, like in your average quarantine-era apartment building. Children, left unsupervised, get into trouble on their own, and their parents are too exhausted or apathetic to do anything about it. Everybody gets into arguments about just how fucked they are.\n\nThe existential dread present in Old is more obvious, and more immediate. \"We are going to die here!\" has a bit more urgency to it when you're on a beach that ages you rapidly than when you're simply muddling through life on a planet that is killing you and everyone you know very, very slowly. Yet it's not hard to look at both projects and compare them to the sandcastle that two characters build near the end of Old , or the smartphone one character loses to the ocean in The White Lotus . Everything we do and everything we have is impermanent. The earth is finding new ways to remind us of that every day.\n\nThe global uncertainty that defined 2020 underscored and highlighted a question plenty of prospective parents are asking right now: Is it unethical to bring a child into a world that is crumbling? Or is having children an essential act of hope for the future? People have continued to have babies in far more dire situations than the one we're currently in. Why would we stop now?\n\nStill - if things keep getting worse, have you just brought a child into a world that will increasingly become uninhabitable? What happens when you bring your kids to a place where the rules you grew up with no longer hold sway? How do you cope with the idea that the world might fall apart to such a degree that they won't have a prom, a graduation, a college education? What if it comes to that?\n\nThere are, of course, billions of people on the planet for whom horrible instability has always been a given, but the awful, democratizing effect of both Covid-19 and climate change is that their horrors are somewhat more evenly spread across the species. While the horrors that Covid-19 inflicted on privileged people around the globe have been far less cataclysmic than those inflicted on everybody else , everyone is affected by it at least a little bit, and climate change seems likely to follow a similar template.\n\nScience-fiction writer Charlie Jane Anders recently wrote in her newsletter about just how much her fear of climate change's effects on humanity has bled into her writing. She also observed, however, that there can be something healing in acknowledging that fear.\n\nI'm honestly terrified of what's coming, and the fact that we're already starting to live through heat waves and superstorms and (maybe) zoonotic diseases doesn't do anything to make the future climate disruption less scary. At all. We are going to suffer, all of us, in ways we've barely wrapped our heads around so far. And yet, I don't think fiction about climate change needs to be disaster porn, or pure misery, or something engineered to \"scare us straight.\" At all. A lot of my work on climate change is about surviving and adapting.\n\nThe trick of being alive right now is pretending that everything we're doing still matters. There is abundant evidence that nothing might be as important as humans banding together in a last-ditch effort to slow the effects of climate change, such that the planet might continue to support life as we know it. Whatever anxiety Covid-19 has provoked, including in so many artists, feels like an appetizer for the main course.\n\n\"We're still parasites on the Earth!\" one character exclaims in The White Lotus , hoping to underline the hypocrisy of his family members, who are squabbling about the right way to organize society. They all know he's right; they also are powerless to stop being parasites. They are the super-rich, and they are loath to change their ways because it's easier to be comfortable than to do something difficult but right. Old touches on this idea as well, in a moment I dare not spoil here. Both works are very interested in the ways in which unchecked capitalism has contributed to the state of the world, past, present, and future, but The White Lotus , in particular, is excoriating about the upper classes.\n\nThe 2020s might very well become a decade of art forged in paranoia and anxiety at the thought of a warming climate that is outpacing our ability or willingness to act before it's too late. But art that is terrified about a slowly building apocalypse isn't a new phenomenon. The 1920s were filled with art set in beautiful baubles of decadence that felt uneasily gleeful ( or deeply traumatized ) in the wake of World War I and the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. The 1950s and '60s were rife with art terrified by the seeming inevitability of nuclear war . We imagine our apocalypses in great detail, perhaps in hopes that we can avert them in reality.\n\nThat sense of looming apocalypse is what most unites Old and The White Lotus in the end. Old suggests that at least some of us might find a way out of our current series of existential threats; The White Lotus isn't so sure. But for as attuned as both works are to this particular moment in time, they also have one eye on what has always been true: We're always heading toward an ending of some sort. Every beach you visit makes you older by virtue of the time you spend there, just not as quickly as the beach in Old . The planet is going to get you eventually.\n\nEverything we do is impermanent, regardless of whether we halt climate change. Centuries from now, if humanity exists, no one will be talking about Old or The White Lotus or this article discussing the two. People will have new concerns and new thoughts to ponder through their art. The things that are permanent - or at least as close to permanent as our conceptions of time will allow - are the ocean and the sand and the endless chain of life that stretches behind and beyond us. Having a child right now is a tremendous act of faith that things might turn out okay in the end, but having a child is always a tremendous act of faith. The world is always ending, and it's always beginning, too. You have to make your peace with that somehow.\n\nOr, to put it more bluntly, as one character says after watching a whale surface in the ocean in The White Lotus : \"What the fuck?\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe cult TNT show mixes race, class, and high camp.\n\nby Cate Young\n\nIf there's one scene in TNT's strip mall-fabulous dramedy Claws that explains the show's raison d'être, it's in the season three episode \"Fly Like an Eagle.\" After the sartorially adventurous Florida nail salon owner Desna Sims (Niecy Nash) and her Southern belle second-in-command Jennifer Husser (Jenn Lyon) confront a crooked governor about his money laundering scheme, he muses, \"I thought you was a Robin Hood with press-on nails.\"\n\nThey raise their hands and unsheath their talons, wiggling their fingers to reveal their expertly manicured nails. Jewel-encrusted behemoths, the nails are meticulously designed and impractical for all but the most delicate work. \"Don't get it twisted,\" Desna replies. \"We full gangsta.\" \"With full sets,\" Jennifer adds.\n\nClaws, whose third season concludes August 11, has always been about race, class, culture, and crime. Set largely in Palmetto, Florida, Claws follows the rivalries, friendships, and tensions between a vaguely legal pill mill run by a Dixie Mafia drug kingpin and the woman-led, hole-in-the-wall nail salon that reluctantly launders his ill-gotten gains.\n\nThe women have gotten progressively deeper into the criminal underworld, getting the better of the various men who have used and abused them, eventually landing at the very top of the local criminal food chain. And they have done it with full sets.\n\nClaws is the latest in a long line of shows and films that upend reductive stereotypes about fashion by using it as a tool to illuminate the many ways women relate to the world. Like Sex and the City , The Devil Wears Prada , and Gossip Girl , Claws understands that fashion is more than clothing; it's utility, iconography, and camp all rolled into one.\n\nThrough its flamboyant and ornate costumes, the show has created a distinct aesthetic recognizable as rooted in the real world and yet still all its own. The \"Florida noir\" setting is a Southern gothic for women who aren't rich, white, and moneyed. Instead, they are tacky and loud, embracing the Florida heat by reflecting it in their clothing, most of which features bold prints, bright colors, and lots and lots of animal print.\n\n\"I try to bring that out in the color palette. In Florida, everybody is in brighter colors and Hawaiian shirts,\" says Dolores Ybarra, the show's costume designer. \"You've got all these different types of people [in the show], but whether it's florals or linens, I try to make sure the characters are dressed for the setting.\"\n\nThe visual language of Claws can be hard to explain without using words like \"gaudy\" or \"ostentatious\" or \" cosquelle \" (a Trinidadian Creole word meaning outlandish or garish), but it's a highly specific look that is instantly familiar to the women who grew up knowing that nothing beats a hoop earring you can put your fist through. The show's characters embrace a maximalist approach born of new money: No rhinestone is too big, no jumpsuit too tight, and no shorts ever quite short enough.\n\nSince the show has been on the air, the women of Claws have graduated from laundering money through their nail salon to becoming enmeshed in political intrigue involving a casino, private prisons, and international cartels. They've hit the big time, and their clothing has adjusted to match. But even though money can buy you labels, it can't buy you taste. For these women, more is more is more. Before they leave the house, they look in the mirror and add two accessories.\n\n\"Their style now is still true to who they are and where they came from,\" says Ybarra. \"They've started making money but they don't know how to spend it. Jenn [Husser], for example, can be walking around with a great bag, but she doesn't know how to pull it together with a look. Money can't buy style.\"\n\nIt's not a coincidence that how we perceive women who wear acrylic nails or loud, bold colors is intertwined with race and class. The audaciousness of Claws' fashion invokes thoughts of frivolity and excess that exist in contrast to cultural expectations of what women of color are worth. Like the sentiments that drove the zoot suit riots of 1943 , black and brown women are not allowed to indulge in overabundance. Any minor decadence must be stripped to retain respectability. The women who fail at this innovate styles out of a combination of innovation and poverty. Sometimes, these looks are stolen and replicated in fashion magazines.\n\nThis dynamic plays out in humiliating ways for black women in the real world every day. When Serena Williams wore a custom black Nike catsuit to play at the French Open in 2018 , French Tennis Federation president Bernard Giudicelli reacted by announcing that the dress code would be changed to prevent her from wearing it again in the future, voicing his disapproval as a desire to \"respect the game and the place.\" The invocation of respect is incredibly charged, and directly suggested that Williams was sullying the traditions of the game by dressing in a way her competitors did not.\n\n\"I think about how black women with naturally curvier figures are policed for wearing clothing that is 'too provocative' simply because of how it fits their bodies,\" says the author and activist Feminista Jones. \"While I don't think white women escape it, we don't see as much public chastisement of them as we do with, say, the teacher who went viral for what she was wearing in front of her class.\"\n\nThe statistics bear this out. A 2017 report from the National Women's Law Center showed that female students of color are more than five times as likely to be suspended from school as their white counterparts, and a follow-up study in 2018 identified dress code violations, especially for curvier students, as a major culprit.\n\n\"When black women embody sexiness, even when they aren't being intentional about it, there are those who react in negative ways because they see us as a threat of some sort,\" Jones says. \"When we appear to exhibit it, albeit it 'innocently,' people have visceral reactions, which is why the kind of policing that happens with Serena Williams or even Beyoncé happens.\"\n\nFor Ybarra, being aware of these issues is part of the job, and she's especially conscious to dress Desna and Jennifer in clothing that hugs their figures, accentuates their curves, and projects the confidence of the characters.\n\n\"There are a lot of voluptuous women who aren't your typical size 2 with no breasts and no curves. These women have curves. And I believe Desna has made them feel confident that a woman who has these curves ... can rock this with no looking back,\" she said.\n\nContrast this with the beige neutrality of the Ann Taylor brand and the rich white women the name conjures. The decision to be demure, to rely on colors that do not offend or call attention, is tied up in class-specific ideas of propriety and respectability. What looks demure on Ivanka Trump or Taylor Swift may look \"vulgar\" on Jennifer Lopez. That's the way bodies work. But it's a classist stereotype that only poor brown women wear acrylic nails.\n\nAnd it would be a mistake to examine the costumes of Claws without ever getting to the titular nails. Culturally, long nails serve multiple functions. As decoration, they give the wearer an additional outlet to express themselves and their creativity, particularly since nail art returned to the height of chic nearly a decade ago. But more generally, these \"claws\" serve as an indication of luxury. In much the same way that Melania Trump wearing her coats draped over her shoulders acts as a class-specific signal that she never has to raise her arms to do any labor, long nails indicate that the wearer does not need to wash dishes, take out the trash, or deign to do any work that might require her hands. She can afford to wear acrylics that would otherwise be an impractical impediment.\n\nThis is rarely literal; most women wearing long acrylic nails are leading normal, everyday lives and tending to day-to-day activities as they always would have. But the nails add an element of opulence that hint at adventurousness, verve, and excitement. What makes Claws stand out is that it situates these nails in their natural habitat: with the black and brown women who made them so popular to begin with.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times , Morgan Dixon, the head of the show's nail department, said, \"People purchase art to put on their walls. Nails are bringing art to everyday people. It's art you can attain.\" Dixon makes sure the nails never match the clothing; they have to stand out against the attention-grabbing outfits because they're central to the characters' way of being. As with women in the real world, the characters' nails are totems they can use to signify their personalities. The nails are camp as high art, and the recognizable aesthetic is anything but accidental.\n\nWhat makes Claws special is that the fashion is true to life. These women aren't aspirational in the traditional sense; their clothing is largely accessible to any woman who might choose to seek it out. But that's the genius of the show's intentional costume design.\n\nAs extravagant as these women's fashion choices are, they never feel out of place because the characters move through the world as though they belong. While they lean into their new identities as criminal overlords, they also lean into their authentic selves: They reclaim the invocation of \"trashy\" as a descriptor and turn it around on itself, signposting that they will always be vamps and never give up their big hair and rhinestones.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

      "text": "I grew up thinking journalism was just for rich white people. I was mostly right.\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Joshua Rivera\n\n\"Internships,\" the headline in the New York Times's opinion section read, \"Are Not a Privilege.\" The op-ed was by Darren Walker of the Ford Foundation, and it discussed what he called \"America's internship-industrial complex\" - the way unpaid internships effectually lock out diverse, talented young workers who cannot possibly afford to work for free.\n\nIt got media types talking about journalism's unpaid internship economy and why it's insidious. I figured it's a good opportunity to tell you a little bit about my experience with unpaid internships, because I am, improbably, a member of \"the media,\" and I'm kind of tired about only ever seeing white colleagues sound off about this nonsense whenever a fellow person of color addresses it on a platform as big and white as the New York Times.\n\nIt's a matter of optics: While it is presumptuous to assume my white colleagues are all privileged (they're not), collectively it looks like a bunch of people who have benefited from a messed-up system merely shrugging and saying, Hey, ain't that some bullshit?\n\nAfter five years of working in this field - previously for publications like Fast Company and Entertainment Weekly, currently for GQ and Vulture - I remain confident that the biggest reason I have the career I do can only empirically be called \"dumb luck.\" My parents would call it the grace of God , which honestly feels much more true when you do the math and see how stupid unlikely it all is.\n\nIn between my junior and senior years of college (and oh, man, COLLEGE - another big grace-of-God/dumb luck moment in my life), I took an unpaid internship at Gawker Media. This is something I could only do because my parents - poor, blue-collar Hispanic folk with three other kids to feed after my skinny brown geek ass - bent over backward to stay in Bergen County, New Jersey, in an old-ass apartment building where none of the walls were straight and a fuse blew out if we ever had the hubris to run the microwave and the air conditioning at the same time.\n\nThey crammed the six of us into an apartment meant for four people, because I got into a good magnet high school they wanted me to stay in and because they wanted to be near the family church. They believed faith came first, and they wanted a better life for their children.\n\nEven if they didn't know what that better life looked like. I barely did.\n\nMost bizarre to me was how necessary the school's career development office stressed unpaid internships were\n\nAnyway, my parents were able to keep us in this nice, white New Jersey neighborhood - just a river's width away from the Hispanic neighborhoods where, based on our income and culture, we \"belonged\" - and I went to a high school with a faculty that worked hard to make sure its students all knew everything there was to know about college and internships and that I, specifically, could have those things.\n\nDon't gloss over that last bit. See, I had to be told I could go to college, any college, anywhere, and study anything. Before that, I just assumed it wasn't for me. I would've gone to a community college - Bergen County had a good one - and studied something \"sensible.\" Accounting, or IT. This would have been enough - enough to make everyone proud, enough to help my family out, enough to have a better life than the one my parents led. Sure, I was good at writing, but the hell was I going to do with that? That shit's for white people.\n\nThen I applied to Syracuse University - to the Newhouse School, a school whose reputation I was entirely ignorant of, a school I only knew about because it had partnered with my local paper to bring brown kids like me out there for a weekend to learn what studying journalism was like. I applied because it was the first honest-to-God college campus I had seen with my own eyes and thought, Damn , wouldn't this be nice?\n\nI mentioned applying to Newhouse to a local Syracuse recruiter, and he scoffed at me. \"Oh,\" he said. \"The hard one .\" He then told me about the school's reputation, its relatively low acceptance rate, how I should consider applying to the less stringent College of Arts and Sciences and maybe transferring later.\n\nI got in anyway, and became the first in my family to go to college, on a grant. I wouldn't have been able to attend otherwise. I still think about that guy. I hope he isn't recruiting anymore.\n\nAll of college was a culture shock for me, a surreal experience I never stopped feeling like I wasn't supposed to have. But most bizarre to me was how necessary the school's career development office stressed unpaid internships were, how chill we all were supposed to be with doing immense amounts of entry-level work for free.\n\nThey said a lot of things, but most of what I heard in my head was, Whoa, this shit really is for rich white people . I could not comprehend how I, had I not lived walking distance from a train station minutes away from New York City, would have ever pulled that off. Everywhere, kids were moving to other states to do unpaid gigs for this network or that publication. I was stuck where God planted my ass, and even then it barely worked out.\n\nI applied to an unpaid internship at Gawker's video game blog Kotaku on a lark. Thinking I couldn't possibly get it, I wrote a wise-ass application email I wouldn't have otherwise sent. I got it.\n\nI had to work two other part-time jobs and fight my father tooth and nail to keep it. See, an unpaid internship was foolish to him. He was right, but if I wanted to make the most of this education I was getting, I had to play a game we were never allowed to even see . A game people of our stature didn't have any business playing.\n\nMy pops was just looking out for me, but he was using a math that was meant to keep us where we were. Things got heated. He threw me out the house. Having pissed off the guy who drove me to work, I walked two miles to one of the part-time jobs that paid me money to afford the train tickets to my unpaid gig, furious but hoping he didn't mean it. I came home that night, because of course he didn't.\n\nI never took an unpaid internship again. Didn't have to. A Gawker line on my résumé and Kotaku bylines in my clip file did a lot for me, because media hiring is an image-driven game of six degrees of separation and I had lucked my way into a reason to get people to just look at my writing.\n\nWhen they did, I got to sit in newsrooms populated almost entirely by people who were nothing like me, empowered by a privilege that, until a few years ago, I hadn't even known existed. And they were fine. Nice people who were smart and talented and whom I learned a lot from.\n\nBut they might as well have been from another goddamn planet. And I was writing for them, and people like them. Nobody back home cares about startups, and all the writing and reporting I did for the Hacker News set couldn't be any more removed from the reality of my family's life.\n\nToday, my work is a little more relevant to the lives of the people I grew up around - I write about entertainment - but for publications that serve audiences that are overwhelmingly college-educated, no stranger to this strange machine I've slipped my way into. No one back home knows about Vox.com .\n\nBefore we're done here, I want to tell you about J.\n\nRemember that program I told you about? The one that took me to my alma mater for the first time as a high schooler? I went back last fall -this time as a chaperone, escorting a bus full of bright-eyed brown kids hoping to go to college, be journalists, tell stories.\n\nJ kept to himself most of the trip, a small Latino kid who looked both fiercely intelligent and fiercely committed to hiding it. At one point, something happened to J. He shut down entirely, seemed to hate everything. It took me a whole dinner's worth of shooting the shit about sports and girls to get him to tell me what bothered him. Turned out a current Syracuse student had asked J where he was from, and when J told him, the student was taken aback.\n\n\"What are you doing here?\" the prick asked.\n\nAnd so I told J about the quiet fury I've lived with since making it Out, since achieving the dream my grandparents had for us all from the moment they set foot in this country and struck out on their own. I told him that he's going to feel like all this isn't for him, that it's going to feel like he cheated his way in, that he's going to have to endure the casual, painful ignorance that comes from privilege, that he's going to see the casual wealth and opportunity of all the nice white people around him and feel like he can't possibly have a chance to compete.\n\nJournalism speaks for those who cannot. It is the clear, level voice broadcasting the message of people with voices too raw from shouting on their own for far too long. And journalism is doing it half-blind.\n\nAnd then I told him how far he's come just by sitting in that dining hall with me, about how many of us don't even get to know what that's like , that, yes, the game is rigged, but our very presence brings it a little bit closer to being overturned entirely. How he's going to prove to the world that it's wrong, that he can't be kept down.\n\nBecause that's what all of it does, somehow - prestigious degrees from private universities, alumni networks, unpaid internships, and stupid, ignorant comments from the beneficiaries thereof: keep kids like J out.\n\nBack in New Jersey, as the kids all got off the bus we took upstate and into their parents' cars, J came over to me and shook my hand. Told me that conversation made a trip he would've otherwise written off entirely worth it. I hope he meant it. I hope he's out there, applying to schools, schools that he's been conditioned to think aren't for him. Causing trouble. Like a journalist.\n\nJournalism has been making headway in areas that help bolster newsroom diversity, that will help kids like J - unpaid internships are virtually extinct at major publications, and editors are slowly working toward making their roster of writers less homogeneous. But journalism is also hamstrung. Dependent on advertisers and their customers or on the fickle, unknowable workings of a social media algorithm .\n\nThis is a problem that is bigger than journalism, but it's one that is paramount for journalism to solve. Journalism speaks for those who cannot. It is the clear, level voice broadcasting the message of people with voices too raw from shouting on their own for far too long. And journalism is doing it half-blind.\n\nI don't ever want to have the kind of conversation I had with J again. I want it to be unnecessary sometime in my lifetime, and soon. But I know it won't be. The problem is too big, involving too many institutional policies and systemic injustices to be solved anytime soon. Change is slow, and I am young. But that's okay. I'll keep having those conversations.

      "text": "Seahawks coach Pete Carroll implores coaches, white people to listen to Black people\n\nRENTON, Wash.-- Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll delivered a passionate monologue during his news conference Saturday, speaking for more than 14 minutes about the need for white people to gain a better understanding of racism in America.\n\n\"They don't know enough, and they need to be coached up and they need to be educated about what the heck is going on in this world,\" Carroll said.\n\nThe Seahawks decided after a lengthy team meeting not to practice Saturday. Carroll was not scheduled to speak with reporters but did so after a last-minute change to the team's media availability. He began by acknowledging Jackie Robinson Day and saying he wanted to talk \"about some stuff that's on my heart.\"\n\n\"Black people can't scream anymore,\" Carroll said, \"they can't march anymore, they can't bare their souls anymore to what they've lived with for hundreds of years because white guys came over from Europe and started a new country with a great idea and great ideals and wrote down great writings and laws and all of that, about democracy and freedom and equality for all, and ... that's not what happened because we went down this other road here.\n\n\"We followed economics and rich white guys making money, and they put together [a] system of slavery, and we've never left it, really. It's never gone away. The really amazing thing I've learned is Black people know the truth. They know exactly what's going on. It's white people that don't know. And it's not that they're not telling us. They've been telling us. We know what's right and what's wrong. We just have not been open to listen to it.\"\n\nCarroll called on coaches at all levels to lead the charge, because their positions give them so much influence.\n\n\"So coaches, I'm calling on you,\" he said. \"Let's step up. No more being quiet, no more being afraid to talk the topics, no more 'I'm a little bit uncomfortable, I might lose my job over this because I've taken a stand here or there.' Screw it. We can't do that anymore. Maybe if we do, we can be a leadership group that stands out, and maybe others will follow us. But it's not just for coaches. I just know that I might have a better ear listening to me when I'm talking to coaches.\"\n\nCarroll did not take questions from reporters. His comments come amid a landmark week in American professional sports during which teams protested the police shooting of Jacob Blake by declining to play in games or practice. Quarterback Russell Wilson told 710 ESPN Seattle on Friday that the Seahawks would have joined other teams in not playing if they had had a game this week.\n\nSafety Jamal Adams , who was traded to the Seahawks from the Jets last month, thanked Carroll and the organization in a tweet Saturday for \"really hearing us as Black athletes.\"\n\n\"This is a special place, like I've said before where everyone's willing to learn and understand that wrong is wrong, and right is right,\" Adams wrote.\n\nCarroll said that with the greater prevalence of media compared to decades ago, \"everybody has a voice, and we all are seeing the truth of how Black people are being treated in our streets. Really, law enforcement is a huge issue to our guys because they're frightened for their lives. They're frightened for the lives of their loved ones and their children. They're frightened because they don't know what's going to [happen] because of what we continue to see.\"\n\nWhile talking about tangible actions to create change, Carroll said all Seahawks players will be officially registered to vote as of Saturday. He called that \"a start.\"\n\nOn Friday, 27-year-old Seahawks safety Quandre Diggs said he's registered to vote this year for the first time in his life.\n\nCarroll stressed the importance of listening to Black athletes.\n\n\"There's no question what's happened,\" he said. \"They're living scared to death. And it never was OK; just now that we see so vividly what's going on, we have to get it stopped now. I hope somebody's listening, because we have to create the change and we've got to be the change to get that done. Coaches, let's let us be the ones. Lead in your communities. We're in communities everywhere across this country, we're all over the place in all the different sports. Hear me. Let's go. Let's get this done.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Culture Clash\n\n&#151; -- In our zeal to appear righteous or courageous or free of bigotry, a ratings-pleasing mob hell-bent on revenge turned Donald T. Sterling -- a victim of privacy invasion and white supremacy -- from villain to martyr.\n\nIn a society filled with impurities, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers committed the crime of speaking impure thoughts in the privacy of a duplex he apparently provided for his mistress. And now an angry, agenda-fueled mob provoked NBA commissioner Adam Silver into handing Sterling a basketball death sentence.\n\nOn Tuesday, just 72 hours after the release of Sterling's Pillow Talk Tapes by TMZ, a rookie commissioner imposed a lifetime ban on a flawed man whose rights were violated.\n\nMob rule is dangerous. Well-intentioned, TV-baited mobs are the most dangerous. They do not consider the consequences of their actions, and they're prone to take a simple-minded, instant-gratification approach to justice rather than a strategic one.\n\nRemoving Donald Sterling from the NBA solves nothing. It sets a precedent that will likely boomerang and harm the black players and coaches who are shocked and outraged that an 80-year-old man with a documented history of bigoted actions also has bigoted private thoughts.\n\nLet's be careful here. From the owner's box to the locker room, professional sports are overrun with wealthy men in complicated, volatile sexual relationships. If TMZ plans to make \"pillow talk\" public and the standard is set that \"pillow talk\" is actionable, it won't be long before a parade of athletes joins Sterling on Ignorance Island.\n\nA right to privacy is at the very foundation of American freedoms. It's a core value. It's a mistake to undermine a core value because we don't like the way a billionaire exercises it. What happens when a disgruntled lover gives TMZ a tape of a millionaire athlete expressing a homophobic or anti-Semitic or anti-white perspective?\n\nWarriors coach Mark Jackson, who called for Clippers fans to boycott Game 5, seems quite vulnerable to mob rule. Jackson is super-religious. He's previously been extorted by a stripper he kept as a mistress. And some of the LGBT community views Jackson as homophobic.\n\nThe conversation revolving around Donald Sterling is unsophisticated, and so was the heavy-handed punishment. They're driven by emotion rather than logic. It does not serve the greater good of the offended black community. Sterling is a scapegoat. He is an easy target, a decoy so that we do not address the elephant he walked into his mistress' bedroom.\n\n\"We don't evaluate what's right and wrong,\" Sterling is heard telling his black-and-Latina mistress when she asked if it was right to treat black as less than white. \"We live in a society. We live in a culture. We have to live within that culture.\"\n\nSterling adheres to a pervasive culture, the hierarchy established by global white supremacy.\n\n\"I don't want to change the culture because I can't,\" Sterling says. \"It's too big.\"\n\nThis was Sterling's one moment of clarity. The culture of white supremacy created Donald Sterling. He did not create the culture.\n\nMuch of what Sterling said on the tape is a rambling mess that can be interpreted many ways by sophisticated, mature and objective ears. To my ears, he doesn't care that his mistress has black friends. He doesn't care if she has sexual relationships with black men. He's married. They're not in a monogamous relationship. He simply does not want her extracurricular activities, particularly when they might involve black men, flaunted at his basketball games or all over Instagram.\n\nThis conversation, while grotesque and abhorrent, is not remotely unique or limited to old white men. My father was hood-rich, good-looking and a playa who enjoyed the company of a younger, kept woman. Many of his friends had similar tastes. Their private conversations about dating could sound every bit as abhorrent and grotesque as Sterling's. I've heard young black men and women engage in equally grotesque and abhorrent private conversations, particularly when their feelings are hurt or they feel betrayed.\n\nNo. The substantive meat of Sterling's Sex, Lies and Audiotape is his point about the culture that created his worldview. He is adhering to the standards of his peer group. He is adhering to the standards of the world he lives in. It's a world inhabited by all of us. It's a culture that shapes everyone's worldview on some level. It fuels the black self-hatred at the core of commercialized hip-hop culture, and is at the root of the NAACP's initial plan to twice honor an unrepentant bigot with a lifetime achievement award.\n\nWhite-supremacy culture is created, maintained and run by rich white men, Sterling's peers. He is the longest-tenured owner in the NBA. Former commissioner David Stern had multiple opportunities to run Sterling out of the league for his bigoted actions. Sterling's peers have always protected him ... until he had the audacity and stupidity to be caught on tape explaining the culture they maintain.\n\nIt's comical to watch the well-intentioned mob circle around Sterling as if his unintended transparency says nothing about his peer group. It's also too beneficial. It's too comfortable. Well-intentioned white people should be holding nationally televised panel discussions focusing on ways to lessen the damaging impact of white-supremacy culture. Well-intentioned white people who work within or support the NBA should be demanding that the NBA power structure cede some of its governing power to men and women who look like the overwhelming majority of the league's players. Instead, the mainstream fanned the flames, enraging the angry black mob looking for a quick solution, a sacrificial lamb -- and now, by the end of the week, we'll be back to business as usual, pretending the stoning of Sterling harmed the culture that created him.\n\nIt's also too beneficial.

No single American has spent as much money in the past decade on the American political system as Steyer.\n\nYet he can surprise when least expected.\n\nAt the start of a campaign stop in Philadelphia last month, one of America's wealthiest men called out to a young campaign aide just before entering a retail store on a rundown strip along South 9th Street.\n\n\"Hey Luis, you got any money?\"\n\n\"We shouldn't go into these stores and not buy anything.\"\n\nA long line of well-heeled, would-be presidents have sought the White House, banking on their money overcoming a lack of name recognition or raw experience in retail politics, and fallen short -- at times spectacularly. But Steyer, a billionaire and Democratic mega-donor, could become the first to test whether President Donald Trump's electoral success in 2016 has changed that calculus.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with ABC News which touched far more on the personal than the political, Steyer spoke at length about his faith, his fortune, his quirks and his passions.\n\nIn a wildly-unpredictable Democratic primary, his supporters believe Steyer could penetrate the field with his sense of candor and a track record of extraordinary financial success.\n\nSteyer's success in the race itself may ultimately depend on whether voters relate to an unconventional coastal liberal with a distinct California sensibility.\n\nThe long-shot candidate's wealth spent on political ad campaigns and various networking efforts have helped him stay afloat, though he remains ranked among the bottom tier of candidates who will take the stage for next week's debate.\n\nCritics on both sides of the aisle harbor deep doubts about Steyer's viability.\n\n\"I don't think he has a prayer,\" said Republican political strategist Alex Castellanos, an ABC News consultant. \"Steyer thinks he's a Democratic party leader because they take his money, but he is a rich white male in a party that hates rich white males, a party that's embarrassed by wealth.\"\n\n\"Since religion is important to him, maybe I can say this,\" Castellanos said as he prepared to paraphrase a famous quote from the Bible. \"It's easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to gain the Democratic nomination for president.\"\n\n\"If you were, say, a tech billionaire -- you might have a better shot today,\" the Republican strategist continued. \"Steyer made his money buying and selling money, investments. He didn't invent the future. Had he invented the future like some tech wizards, that might have given him a lane, but he didn't invent the future. He exploited the past -- capitalism -- what Democrats are trying to leave behind.\"\n\nAfter spending several years in the late 1970s and early 1980s at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs in New York, Steyer and financier Warren Hellman founded a San Francisco hedge fund, later named Farallon Capital, which grew from managing $15 million at the start to $20 billion today, and where he built his fortune by making high-risk investments in distressed assets. He retired from the firm in 2012 and turned his attention to the environment and a host of liberal political issues in his home state of California.\n\nSteyer has been criticized for making carbon-polluting investments during his time at Farallon -- and then for not divesting of them fast enough. It's an issue that can still rankle him.\n\n\"People always say to me, 'are you sorry you invested in fossil fuels?' And I'm like, 'We invested in everything.' Am I sorry that I realized it had this horrible issue with it? Do I wish I realized it earlier? Yes. Of course I do. Thank you. I wish I were smarter. Thank you. I didn't realize it would be better if I were smarter. Thank you for bringing it up!'\"\n\nWhile he has said that Farallon is completely divested of fossil fuel-related investments, a 2014 New York Times examination of his investments concluded that the investments his firm made in coal-related projects will continue to generate tens of millions of tons of carbon pollution for years.\n\nSteyer has also said he \"deeply regret[s]\" a $34 million investment in 2005 in a for-profit prisons firm called Corrections Corp. of America, which runs migrant detention centers on the U.S.-Mexico border, which have come under sharp criticism by Democratic presidential candidates this year.\n\nThe San Francisco political financier is betting that the urgency of the climate change crisis will minimize these points from his past as financial footnotes, but even some California Democrats are skeptical.\n\n\"The way that these billionaires make their money may be perfectly acceptable and understandable in the business community itself, but when you try to parlay that into a Democratic campaign, a lot of that is going to come back and haunt you,\" said West Coast political consultant Garry South.\n\n\"You're dealing with Democratic primary base voters, not Republican base voters,\" South said. \"To have a candidate come along and say, 'I can run a business' -- that's not a compelling argument to Democrats. They're highly suspicious of business.\"\n\nSteyer has been involved behind-the-scenes in progressive California politics for more than a decade.\n\nIn the past two years, Steyer has also spent more than $10 million on television and digital ads calling for President Trump's impeachment.\n\nHe has flirted with public office before, but never formally run. He had been contemplating running to win the California governorship in 2018, but stepped aside in deference to his friend, current California Governor Jerry Brown -- though a sense of frustration over that race appears to linger within the Steyer family.\n\n\"Tom's a CEO [chief executive officer] by temperament, so, you know, being the junior senator from California didn't have all that much appeal to him,\" said his brother Hume, a New York attorney. \"And [California] governor made a lot more sense to him, but Jerry Brown was smack-dab in the middle of a run. Now, was Tom disappointed that Gov. Brown decided to run at the age of 116 for a third term? Yeah, I would say so.\" (Brown is actually 81). \"But they're friends and he wasn't going to get in the way.\"\n\nSteyer's central issue is combating global warming, and his presence in next week's debate could shake up a field that has only recently began issuing detailed climate change action plans.\n\nAnd just months ahead of the Iowa caucuses, his signature issue is gaining ground nationwide.\n\nA Washington Post/Kaiser Family Foundation poll released last month found that 8 in 10 Americans believe that human activity is fueling climate change, and more than half believe that urgent action is needed within the next decade.\n\nA longtime fundraiser for the Democratic party, Steyer first got formally involved in environmental politics in 2010 when he teamed up with Republican former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz at the helm of a successful campaign to stop California's Proposition 23, which preserved the state's landmark initiative to fight global warming -- and was the campaign's single largest individual donor.\n\nBut his passion for the outdoors may have began much earlier, said his brother Jim, a Stanford University political science professor.\n\nThe three Steyer brothers -- Hume, 65, Jim, 63, and Tom, 62 -- spent their early childhood visiting their mother's family in Minnesota, and went on to spend four summers at Camp Treetops in the Adironacks.\n\n\"No competitive sports - it was all mountain climbing and hiking and gardening and canoeing,\" said Jim Steyer, who lives near his brother Tom in San Francisco. \"At Camp Treetops we had to eat all that sh-ty stuff from the garden and milk cows and take care of horses when we were little,\" he recalled fondly. \"And I think that institution really impacted us,\" he continued.\n\nSteyer's other brother, Hume, said their mother and father were anything but helicopter parents.\n\n\"If you're asking me if Tom's passion comes from my parents, I'm not sure I'd attribute these qualities [to them] as such,\" Hume Steyer said in a recent interview. \"My parents parented with a fairly light hand ... But they weren't tiger parents at all.\"\n\nTheir mother, Marnie Fahr Steyer, was a public schoolteacher and a devout Episcopalian. Their father, Roy Steyer, was an \"irreligious\" Jewish lawyer and World War II Navy lieutenant who went on to become, at 27, one of the only Jewish prosecutors at the postwar Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders.\n\n\"My parents' house was not particularly religious,\" he continued. \"They had different religions. My father was brought up Jewish he was quite irreligious ... My mother was quite religious.\n\nSteyer went to grammar school at New York City's prestigious Buckley School, high school at the New Hampshire prep school Phillips Exeter Academy, Yale University and Stanford University's Graduate School of Business.\n\nThe candidate himself describes their mother as a \"very hard-ass progressive.\"\n\n\"My grandfather was a professor at the University of Minnesota. My mother left Minnesota and went to Wells College in upstate New York, and the day she graduated she moved to New York City. My grandfather told her, 'if you move to New York City not only will I not give you a penny' - not that he was rich - 'but I'll never speak to you again.'\"\n\n\"She moved the next day,\" Steyer said.\n\nTrue to his word, Steyer's grandfather never spoke to her again.\n\nShe became a journalist at Newsweek -- part of a class of then-marginalized female reporters who would later become renowned for their journalistic prowess -- and later wrote and helped produce the NBC Nightly News, Steyer said.\n\nAfter marrying their father, she went back to school and got a masters' degree and began teaching English and remedial writing in New York City public schools and, later, at what was then known as the Brooklyn House of Detention, a jail in downtown Brooklyn for inmates awaiting trial.\n\n\"She was a contradiction in terms: a devout Episcopalian,\" Steyer said with a grin. \"She voted for Shirley Chisolm in '72. She was railing for civil rights and against Vietnam. She was a very hard-ass progressive.\"\n\n\"She really liked to have fun, really liked to fish, really liked to drink, really liked to smoke cigarettes,\" he recalled. \"She was the kind of person who would say .... 'you goddamned son of a bitch!' But if you said f--- or s---, she'd have a heart attack. She loved to hunt she loved to fish, she loved the outdoors as a girl.\"\n\nHe said his mother was even active outdoors in New York City\n\n\"She once caught a fish in the boat pond in Central Park,\" he said. \"She was practicing her fly-fishing skills and she caught a goldfish!\"\n\nSteyer acknowledged that he has a number of personal rituals and reminders he leans on to keep him focused on the work he's doing.\n\nFor years, he's been drawing what's known as a Jerusalem Cross on the back of his left hand before attending church, hitting the campaign trail or speaking in public.\n\n\"I write a cross on my hand to remind myself to tell the truth, no matter what the cost,\" he told ABC News, displaying the pen-inked cross.\n\nHe said it's based on \"the idea that if you're right and you tell the truth, you're right even if takes 2000 years, even if you have some pain along the way, shall we say.\n\n\"It's to remind myself that there's a point here, there's a mission here.\"\n\nHe also has for years worn the same red-patterned Scottish plaid tie design, and is partial to colorfully-beaded belts.\n\nHe listens to gospel music to focus him before big rallies, particularly Aretha Franklin's chart-topping 1972 live album \"Amazing Grace,\" recorded at the New Temple Mission Baptist Church in Los Angeles, and released this year as a documentary film.\n\n\"It's blow-your-mind good!\" he said enthusiastically of the soundtrack, which he said grounds him.\n\n\"There's something to be done here, and you've got to get your energy up to do it,\" he explained in describing these daily reminders. \"You've got to get your gumption up, and get yourself ready ... People are going to push back. So you're going to have to go do it. It's like game day,\" said the veteran collegiate athlete. \"Bring it on.\"\n\nSteyer said that he's unfazed by criticism that a billionaire who has never held elected office has no place running for the U.S. presidency.\n\n\"I don't think I'm comparable to other billionaires,\" he responded sharply. \"Where are the other billionaires who spent 10 years building coalitions?\" he challenged a reporter.\n\n\"You literally can't name one. \"\n\nBut Steyer pivots easily back to his light-hearted self in response to a simpler point of contention: which of the three Steyer brothers is the \"funny one.\"\n\n\"Oh my God, I'm way funnier than those losers!\" he insisted, making a point that both brothers, in separate interviews, conceded.\n\nSteyer is an Episcopalian who began seriously studying the Bible as a young teenager.\n\n\"I didn't think there was just one way to go,\" he said. \"So I went and read the Bible. I'd say I read it somewhat growing up and, I would say, really started thinking about around 13. And I called my mom and said, 'Mom, I believe in God!'\n\n\"And she said, 'Sonny, don't sound so smug. There are many people out there smarter than you that already believed in God,'\" he recalled.\n\nSteyer said faith brings meaning to his life, and that he believes faith can't take different forms for different people. Ultimately, he describes it as a \"positive life force.\"\n\n\"Look you've got to be part of the positive life force,\" he said. \"You've got to find your way to the positive life force. I mean someone in my background can't believe there's only one way. And I don't. And you have to find it. But you choose it. I have a friend who says \"GOD: Great OutDoors.\" Fine. If you can do it, fine. Any way you can do it - fine -- but if you don't do it,\" he said of finding meaning and purpose in faith, \"than I really think that you know at some level you're really missing the point.\"\n\n\"Honestly?\" he continued. \"If you're not doing that, I don't know exactly what it is you are doing on this Earth.\"\n\nDan Morian, a veteran California statehouse reporter who now works for the non-profit political reporting website CalMatters, said that Steyer's engaging authenticity and boyish enthusiasm could surprise people.\n\n\"Not that I've met a lot, but of the billionaires I've known, he's the most normal,\" Morian said. \"He feels to his core that God gave him this life for a reason ... He's one of the few people you meet that that's got a genius level IQ ... just really, really smart and kinda crazy. And not like Trump crazy, like he's gonna start a war.\"\n\nSteyer met his wife, Katherine Taylor -- known to those close to her as \"Kat\" -- at Stanford University and the couple married in 1986.\n\nFriends and family told ABC News that Taylor has had a profound effect on her husband's public initiatives. The couple were among the first to sign Bill Gates and Warren Buffett's Giving Pledge in 2010 - a promise to give away a majority of their fortune.\n\nIn 2006, the couple founded a company that delivers broadband connectivity and teaches computer literacy to small towns in rural Mexico and India. The following year, they founded Beneficial State Bank, which provides commercial banking services to underserved small businesses and non-profits in the Bay Area.\n\n\"Kat is like Tom in certain respects,\" said Hume Steyer, \"in that she really, really, really wants to do the right thing ... And she's very, very sincere, just like Tom.\"\n\nYet \"Tom and Kat have different reactions to Tom's acquisition of wealth. Tom is very, very happy to take all of his wealth and put it to good use. I mean this - he doesn't care about personal comfort at all. If it wasn't for Kat, he'd still be sleeping on a futon.\"\n\n\"But he's not guilty about having made all this money. He doesn't regret it on any level at all. And he doesn't perceive the slightest fault in that he made it, or how he made it. Kat ... does not feel the same way.\"\n\nTaylor did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nBy 2012, Steyer was squarely focused on the environment. He retired from Farallon and contacted environmentalist Bill McKibben -- after reading an influential article on climate change that McKibben wrote that year for Rolling Stone magazine. But McKibben wasn't very interested in a meeting -- so he took the billionaire hiking.\n\n\"He called up and wanted to meet and talk about that [Rolling Stone] piece and truthfully - since I didn't know him from Adam and since my general desire to meet with hedge fund people is pretty small, I demurred at first,\" McKibben told ABC News. \"But it came out that he knew this part of the world where I live and had connections to the Adirondacks, the great mountains up here, so I finally decided, 'what the hell.' We'd go for a hike, and you know, if he was a rich, boring guy at least we'd be hiking and not waste the day. It turned out he was a completely fascinating guy - a fascinating and good-hearted human being.\"\n\n\"He's a good hiker and that counts a lot in my book,\" McKibben continued. \"We went quickly up the mountain -- called Giant Mountain -- in the Adirondacks. We were talking all the way. I was fascinated by what he'd done in the world, his ability to analyze things quickly -- which I guess is what investors do -- and he was highly-interested in ... I know a lot about climate science and climate politics and he was just deeply, deeply, deeply interested in that, so we just talked from the bottom of the mountain to the summit and then back down again, and we've kept up the conversation regularly [ever] since.\"\n\nMcKibben said he's heard Steyer described as a liberal version of the Koch brothers -- the billionaire conservative mega-donors Charles and David Koch, whose political contributions have injected hundreds of million into mostly conservative and libertarian causes that often coincided with their business interests. But he said he flatly disagrees.\n\n\"No,\" McKibben said, \"I don't think that's actually accurate.\"\n\n\"The Koch brothers act out of self-interest. All their political spending and things is designed to advance the interest of their oil and gas business and Steyer's I think quite generally acting in the public interest. He's out there advocating for policies that would make life tougher for rich people not easier. I think he's the anti-Koch brothers.\"\n\nABC News' Meg Cunningham, Felisa Fine and Brad Martin contributed research to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

He added that Slaton's case is the oldest file in their memory.\n\nWhen investigators found Slaton's family in the United States, they told law enforcement they had no contact with him since this alleged crime was committed, the release said.\n\n\"Utilizing all of the US Marshals investigative resources, a lead was eventually developed that Slaton was now living with his new wife in the remote Nayarit region of Mexico, some 400 miles west of Mexico City,\" according to the release.\n\nThe lead was sent to the US Marshals in Mexico City, who was able to speak to Mexican authorities, White said. Slaton ended up being found in a small village of San Juan de Abajo, according to the release.\n\nSlaton was immediately deported to Los Angeles where he began his extradition to Florida 30 days later, White told ABC.\n\nDuring his extradition, Slaton became sick in Colorado and needed to be hospitalized, White said. Lee County Sheriff's Office had to fly to Colorado on Wednesday and bring him back to Florida. They arrived late Saturday night, he said.\n\nSlaton was \"charged with Sexual battery on a victim under 18 years old and Aggravated Child Abuse,\" the release said. He is currently being held without bond in the Lee County Jail, the release said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "4 of the 5 counties with the most death penalty executions are in Texas: Data\n\nThe suspension of California executions may not dent the total national number.\n\nWhile the governor of the country's most populous state halted death penalty executions, that decision may not have a national impact.\n\nWithin two southern states, Texas and Oklahoma, five counties are responsible for one in five executions since the death penalty was reinstated by the Supreme Court in 1976, according to data from the non-profit Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC).\n\nThose counties - Harris, Dallas, Bexar and Tarrant Counties in Texas and in Oklahoma County, Oklahoma - are responsible for 315 out of the 1,493 executions that have taken place in those 43 years.\n\nPrior to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's moratorium on executions , his state performed 13 executions during the same time frame. Data from the DPIC show there are 11 individual counties across the country that had the same number or more executions themselves during that time period.\n\n\"It doesn't really make sense to talk about the death penalty in the United States. The death penalty is exclusively a Southern phenomenon,\" said Evan Mandery, a professor at the John Jay College for Criminal Justice.\n\nThere are 30 states that have the death penalty in the U.S., though four of those states - now including California - have governors who have issued suspensions on executions.\n\nNew Hampshire has the death penalty, but hasn't executed anyone since 1939.\n\nSince the 1976 ruling, there have been 56 executions in Ohio, seven in Utah, four in South Dakota and three in Montana, according to data from the DPIC. By comparison, there were 72 executions in Georgia, 97 executions in Florida, 112 executions in Oklahoma, and 113 executions in Virginia, the data shows.\n\nTo date, the largest amount of death penalty executions occurs in Texas, where there have been 560. That represents 37.5 percent of the total 1,493 executions in the United States since 1976.\n\n\"Texas is an outlier among outliers,\" Mandery said.\n\nMandery said that in spite of its prevalence in certain counties, the death penalty on the whole is \"an extraordinarily rare event - many, many things have to go wrong for someone to be executed in the United States.\"\n\n\"No rich white murderer has ever been sentenced to die, so you need to be almost certainly a person of color, probably killed a white person who did it in a state with the death penalty, who did it in a county within that state where the prosecutor aggressively supports the death penalty and where that prosecutor isn't replaced in office during the time you're on death row by someone who either opposes the death penalty or takes seriously the appellate process,\" Mandery said.\n\nThere are murderers in every state and crimes committed in every county, but experts suggest that key individuals not connected to the crime itself are the ones, who could ultimately be deciding factors in whether or not a criminal is executed.\n\nJennifer Laurin, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, was the chair of the task force assembled by the American Bar Association that worked on their 2013 assessment on Texas' use of the death penalty. The group's report found that \"the state's death penalty system falls far short.\"\n\nLaurin told ABC News that \"there are features of Texas's system that we could potentially explain why it is Texas produces so many more death sentences and executions.\"\n\nOne such factor, Laurin said, was that \"up until about 1995, Texas had ultimately a sort of notoriously deficient system for providing lawyers to poor defendants including poor defendants facing the death penalty.\"\n\n\"In Texas there was very, very, very low quality of defense lawyering provided at every stage from trial through to execution. Texas has made some significant progress but it remains, as compared to other jurisdictions, a place where the provision of council to individuals facing the death penalty is much less consistent in terms of resources and quality as compared to other states, and across cases in Texas,\" she said.\n\nBeyond the quality of the defendant's representation, another factor is how determined the lawyer on the other side of the courtroom was to get a death penalty sentence.\n\n\"The death penalty is really driven by individual aggressive prosecutors and there's some sense of it that it almost feels like vigilante justice,\" Madery said.\n\nThat sentiment could be seen by some previously in the Harris County District Attorney's office - the prosecuting office for the county with the highest number of executions in the country, with 128 deaths.\n\nPatrick McCann, a lawyer in Harris County who has worked on more than 50 death penalty cases, said that \"the corporate culture inside the DA's office among the senior people [was that] you were promoted and achieved respect within the office by how many people you sent to death row.\"\n\nMcCann said that one major change came in 2005 when Texas introduced the sentencing option of life in prison without the possibility of parole. According to a Texas Department of Criminal Justice publication, Texas was one of only four states that did not have that sentencing option when they made the switch.\n\n\"Since then there's been a gradual decline in the trials they have for death [penalty] in this county, but the prior years means there is still a long line for Harris County folks to get executed,\" said McCann.\n\nMcCann thinks that the aforementioned culture in a number of key prosecutors' offices across Texas have \"undergone a sea change,\" including the Harris County District Attorney's office.\n\nIn 2016, Harris County voters, for the first time in nearly four decades, elected a Democratic district attorney. Kim Ogg, who took office in January 2017, was public about how she had previously opposed the death penalty but, came around to allowing it only in the most extreme circumstances.\n\nOgg told The Houston Observer in June of that year that she doesn't view the death penalty as \"a deterrent,\" saying \"it's just pure retribution.\"\n\n\"I'm a human being, and my views have changed before. It's possible they could change again. But while I ran, I left the death penalty on the table. I said I believed in it at the time. I still do,\" she told the magazine.\n\nThere has been something of a slowdown in the rate of executions in Harris County in recent years, both before and during Ogg's administration.\n\nIn 1997, Harris County executed 11 people, and in the mid-2000s, there were two consecutive years where nine people were executed. But since 2010, there have been three or fewer people executed each year in the county.\n\n\"District Attorney Ogg has said that among the most serious actions a government can take is to take a person's life and that the death penalty must only be used for the worst of the worst and most only be done in accordance with the Constitution,\" Ogg's spokesman Dane Schiller told ABC News.\n\n\"While under Texas law, defendants convicted of capital murder face a penalty of life in prison or death, under this administration, zero defendants have been given death sentences by Harris County juries,\" Schiller said, though he noted that there was one death sentence issued in 2018, but that case was handled by a special prosecutor after the district attorney's office was recused over a conflict of interest.\n\nThe decrease in executions in Texas may indicate a slow change in attitudes in the state - as well as the qualms that jurors may now have as science advances as well as reporting of wrongful convictions continue - but experts still point to racism at the root of the use of capital punishment as something that would need to be addressed in conjunction with any major changes.\n\n\"One idea is that [the use of the death penalty is] tied to the culture of lynching in the South and that the dehumanization of prisoners is an artefact of the commodification of people, and there's clearly something to that,\" Mandery said.\n\nMcCann echoed that - while not unique to Texas - the origin and use of the death penalty are tied to \"mostly racism and corruption, but that's my personal view.\"\n\n\"I think the more difficult problem in every state - and this goes from Pennsylvania and Philadelphia to Houston to Los Angeles - is that we as a people don't want to acknowledge the vast problems we have in overcoming a legacy of racism that still infects the death penalty,\" McCann said.\n\nAs for Texas specifically, McCann said that capital punishment is \"deeply ingrained in the culture here.\"\n\nMcCann said that while the rate of executions \"may slow, I don't see it stopping, short of a national decision by someone like the Supreme Court, that we are simply incapable of doing this properly,\" he said.\n\nMandery agreed, and handicapped the odds of such a ruling happening with the current bench of justices unlikely.\n\n\"The only mechanism that would end the death penalty in Texas is Supreme Court action. Five years ago, I would have said that was unlikely but possible [that such an action be handed down]. Now it seems quite unlikely,\" Mandery said.\n\n\"The fate of the death penalty rests with the balance of power on the Supreme Court, and that's hanging by a thread,\" he said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
