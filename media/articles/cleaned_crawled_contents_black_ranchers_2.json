      "text": "Harris Pledges to Help Black Men by Legalizing Marijuana\n\nVice President Kamala Harris promised to legalize recreational marijuana use at the federal level if elected president, her campaign announced as part of a slate of new policy promises Monday.\n\nRecreational cannabis is currently legal in 24 states, but has remained illegal federally, often leading to a contentious clash between overlapping laws.\n\nThe announcement was made alongside new policies the Harris campaign said form an \"Opportunity Agenda\" for Black men, and are designed to appeal to the important voting bloc that traditionally votes overwhelmingly in favor of Democrats .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn the case of marijuana legalization, Black Americans have long been disproportionately arrested, targeted and punished by law enforcement and the judiciary for marijuana and other drug-related offenses.\n\nAccording to FBI data , U.S. law enforcement agencies made roughly 217,000 arrests for marijuana-related offenses last year. Black Americans, who make up 13.7 percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 29 percent of drug arrests, according to the same data. Research also shows Black Americans are convicted at higher rates, and given longer sentences, in criminal cases.\n\n\"Vice President Harris will break down unjust legal barriers that hold Black men and other Americans back by legalizing marijuana nationally, working with Congress to ensure that the safe cultivation, distribution, and possession of recreational marijuana is the law of the land,\" said the Harris campaign, in a press release.\n\nThe campaign added that Harris will \"fight to ensure that as the national cannabis industry takes shape, Black men are able to access wealth and jobs in this new market.\" Notably, data has shown that Black entrepreneurs and workers have frequently been shut out of the cannabis industry as it has emerged across the country as it has become legalized.\n\nThe vice president is expected to detail the legalization plan alongside other policies in Erie, Pennsylvania Monday.\n\nOther announcements made as part of the appeal to Black men include one million fully forgivable loans up to $20,000 for Black entrepreneurs, training and mentorship programs to help Black men enter \"high-demand\" industries, financial support to Black ranchers and farmers including those who were discriminated against by banks and federal loan programs, and a national initiative focused on health issues that disproportionately impact Black men, such as prostate cancer and sickle cell disease.\n\nWhile Harris maintains a commanding lead among Black voters, recent polls have shown her lagging behind historic numbers.\n\nA New York Times/Siena poll found Harris had the support of 78 percent of Black voters. In past elections, Democratic candidates for president have won over 90 percent support from Black voters, including President Joe Biden who received 92 percent in 2020.\n\nWhile in office, former president Donald Trump , Harris' Republican opponent in the election, threatened a crackdown on states that had legalized marijuana before backing down. He has since softened his stance on weed, and supports a ballot measure that would legalize recreational use in his home state of Florida.\n\nsean.craig@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "The ex-fitness trainers creating a Black-owned ranch: 'We need a new system'\n\nThe stress on the food system caused by the pandemic gave the Stewarts an idea: creating a commercial ranch in Arizona\n\nOn the eastern edge of the Sonoran desert, in the grasslands not 10 miles north of the US-Mexico border, James and Rachael Stewart have arranged a dozen weightlifting machines and dumbbell sets.\n\nAt sundown, as they and their four children herd lambs and alpacas into their stalls, the occasional chick or duck passes between these markers of the Stewarts' previous life.\n\nTwo years ago, James and Rachael were fitness trainers living in a Phoenix suburb.\n\nJames traveled frequently to bodybuilding competitions across the south-west, in cities such as Tucson and Albuquerque, and Rachael had just completed a master's degree in business management. But then the Covid-19 pandemic struck, shutting down meatpacking plants across the country, and they found themselves without the protein sources they needed as athletes - and parents of four growing children.\n\nThat's when an idea came to them that sounded a little impossible at first, but felt more important the more they thought about what doing it would mean for their kids. James sold his 1972 Chevy Caprice and the couple purchased 10 acres of land just outside Douglas, Arizona . They were going to start one of Arizona's very few Black-owned commercial ranches.\n\nIn October of 2020, James and Rachael Stewart broke ground on the ranch they are calling the Southwest Black Ranchers. As a biracial couple (James is Black and Rachael is Filipina and Mexican), they immediately began looking for other Black ranchers for guidance - and so far have struggled to connect with any in Arizona. According to the USDA , Black farmers make up less than 1.5% of the country's producers and are primarily located in southern and mid-Atlantic states, despite the long, but often forgotten, history of Black ranchers in the American west. Connecting with other Black farmers, ranchers and gardeners across the country through social media, the Stewarts hope to build a ranch that inspires their children and other new generations of Black farmers to return to the south-west.\n\nIn 1920, Black farmers made up 14% of the industry, but after thousands lost their land due to discriminatory lending practices at the US Department of Agriculture, less than 2% remained . In order to connect with other Black farmers, the Stewarts joined a Facebook group where they met Texans who taught them about hydroponics and a South African farmer whose work on regenerative agriculture is inspiring their goals for the ranch. At home in Arizona, they also connected with Drinking Gourd Farms , a network of Black gardeners and homesteaders in Phoenix, who are helping the Stewarts mulch their farm's soil. As the Stewarts prepare their ranch they're hoping to create a world where their children don't think twice about being part of a Black-led agricultural revolution.\n\nWhen James and Rachael first bought their land outside of Douglas, they were motivated by the inequities they had seen come to light during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. Tyson Foods had just shut down several of its meatpacking plants and published a full-page New York Times ad warning that \"the food supply chain is breaking\". That same week, the USDA reported that beef production was down 25% and grocery stores started rationing the amount of meat each customer could purchase. That's when James and Rachael realized the perils of a factory farming system, where the fate of one company could harm their ability to feed their four children. They wondered if they'd have more control if they owned their own livestock - and if the food supply chain overall might be more sustainable if there were many local farms, meatpackers and processors, as opposed to just a few.\n\nAlthough those questions have continued to motivate them, James and Rachael say it's their children - who go by their nicknames J5, Nay, Zey and JG - that are the real driving force behind their work.\n\n\"We live in a very white state,\" said Rachael, and many people \"don't realize the societal impact of [Black] kids not seeing positive role models who look like them\". Arizona's population is only about 5% Black, and nearly 83% white. When the Stewarts discovered that they'd be nearly the only Black ranchers in Arizona, they decided they wanted to fill that gap for their kids.\n\n\"Sometimes you need to actually see something before it can become tangible,\" said Rachael. \"You need to see a Black farmer before you realize you could be a Black farmer.\"\n\nJames and Rachael see their work as parents not just as role models, but also as the creators of new systems that they can pass down to their children. \"We want to create a situation where our kids have an option, and they have a trade,\" so that if they \"don't want to take on the debt\" of college \"that doesn't hinder them from being successful\", says James. Although he and his wife both have college degrees, they'd like their children to have choices so they don't \"have to go $80,000 into debt to get a $35,000 job\".\n\nWe're trying to \"create an alternative system for minority and socially disadvantaged ranchers\", says Rachael, so that we can hand over a business to our children \"that is always going to be needed\". Part of that work has involved creating alternative networks with other Black ranchers, farmers, gardeners and entrepreneurs.\n\nThe Stewarts realize they have a long way to go to make their ranch financially viable for the long term. Although they were able to purchase their initial animals and supplies with the support of a Go Fund Me account, they are now Beta testing approaches to sales, meeting with meat processors, and also applying for grants, including ones from the USDA.\n\nOne of those first collaborations was with the Drinking Gourd Farms community in Phoenix, which is primarily led by Black Muslim refugee women. During the early months of the pandemic, Drinking Gourd Farms also began to re-evaluate the sustainability of the food supply chain. To make sure Black families had access to healthy food while that system was in turmoil, they distributed food boxes to 4,600 families across the state. When a few of Drinking Gourd Farms' members heard about the Stewarts' plans, they drove down to visit the family in Douglas. That's how James and Rachael met their ranch manager, Grand Rahba.\n\nRahba had spent most of the past decade working at independent farms and gardens across the country, learning sustainable techniques such as composting and permaculture, before landing at Drinking Gourd Farms.\n\nOn those farms, Rahba says he learned the techniques to \"set up an ecosystem that will sustain itself\" and the \"importance of having access to stuff, being able to grow your own food, raise animals, have space\".\n\nWhen he met the Stewarts, he was immediately drawn to their mission and bought his own five acres of land adjacent to theirs. For Rahba, Southwest Black Ranchers was an opportunity to prioritize alternatives to capitalism, that would allow him, the Stewarts and other Black farmers to reconnect with the land and their livestock, while reimagining their relationship to work and rest .\n\nIt's late morning on the Stewart's ranch and Romeo, their sole male alpaca, has gotten loose. He's supposed to be in his pen while the females graze, but he's wily and desperate to mate, so instead he's chasing Soleil - who seems decidedly uninterested in his affections. The pair are not two feet away from crashing into their pen's fencing when 12-year-old J5 lassos Romeo in one fell swoop - accomplishing a skill he and his siblings have been practicing for months.\n\nZey, Nay and JG cheer for their brother as he shepherds Romeo into his stall, and then each takes their own turn trying to lasso the alpaca under J5's now expert guidance. What none of them realize in the moment is that J5 has mastered a skill that Black ranchers invented and perfected generations before him.\n\n\"It was enslaved cowboys of African descent in Mexico who invented this new technique of capturing cattle\" with a lasso, says Andrew Sluyter, professor at Louisiana State University and author of Black Ranching Frontiers: African Cattle Herders of the Atlantic World, 1500-1900. \"The previous way of capturing cattle was simply to ride behind them with a lance that had a sharp blade on the end of it\" and cut the tendons in the cow's rear legs. But then, in the 17th century, there was \"a change in the laws that makes it illegal in New Spain and what's now Mexico for cowboys who are slaves ... to own one of those lances with that halfmoon-shaped blade on the end of it because there were more and more slave rebellions.\"\n\nThat's when enslaved cowboys developed the idea of lassoing cattle.\n\n\"There was this imperative for Black cowboys to advance some kind of alternative means to capture cattle that didn't involve a weapon,\" said Sluyter, who cites an engraving from 1643 of Black cowboys demonstrating the technique by using a long pole to drop a lasso over a cow. \"By the 1700s it had been perfected so they no longer needed that pole.\"\n\nAlthough lassos and cowboy hats are typically associated with white cowboys in the American west, Sluyter says it shouldn't come as a surprise that many early ranching techniques were developed by people of African descent.\n\n\"If you look at the world in 1492 when Columbus lands in the Caribbean, the largest single area of open range cattle ranching was the Sahel\" in Africa, he says. \"That's where cattle and humans evolved together over millions of years\" and \"that's where the expertise was.\"\n\nThe word \"cowboy\" itself originated during slavery when ranchers called Black cow hands by the pejorative \"cow boy\". During reconstruction, many formerly enslaved men took jobs as ranch hands and by the late 1800s, historians estimated that one in four cowboys working on the frontier were Black. One of those men was Nat Love , who earned the nickname \"Deadwood Dick\" in a roping competition in 1876. Another was Bass Reeves , the first Black deputy US marshal west of the Mississippi River - and allegedly the inspiration for the Lone Ranger.\n\nToday, the legacy of Black cowboys is continued by groups such as the Louisiana Trail Riders and the Compton Cowboys . For more than a decade, the Arizona Black Rodeo Association has held a rodeo in Phoenix each year. And Black cowboy Lu Vason has, since 1984, hosted the traveling Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo , named after the Black cowboy who invented rodeo steer wrestling (or bulldogging). But to this day, few Black cowboys or ranchers actually own their own land or livestock.\n\nIf you ask James and Rachael for their address, they'll send you GPS coordinates instead. Although their ranch isn't far outside of Douglas, their neighbors are few and far between - depending on the route you take, you might see the \"No Trespassing\" signs along a neighbor's fence, but then again you might only spot the distant mountains and mesquite trees. Despite the many neighboring farms, the Stewarts are actually located in a food desert: the only grocery store for miles north of the border is a WalMart.\n\n\"There's a fear of being out on the land, and being rural, and being the only minority there. It's a valid fear,\" said Rachael. Moving out of the city, she and James say, has been precarious.\n\n\"If you're coming out here with money obviously everything's different, but if you're not coming out here with money then there's a lot of change you've got to get ready to deal with. It's not the easiest experience in the world,\" says James. But if you do come out on the land, \"you're getting a lot more freedom\".\n\nSince moving, James and Rachael have helped three other Black families buy land on their same street. They're still wary of harassment, but they've started building their own networks - largely made up of people they've met on social media, like a South African farmer whose work on regenerative agriculture is inspiring their goals for the ranch and Black ranchers in Texas who have taught them about hydroponics.\n\nBlack farmers \"are already doing these things independently because they've been forced to\", says Rachael. For generations, official structures, such as the USDA, did not support Black farmers equally, so those farmers created their own systems. But the result, Rachael says, is that those independent networks exist now for ranchers who hope to challenge the factory farming system.\n\nThe Stewarts have built almost everything on their ranch from scratch. They've traded their labor for supplies, built pens out of pallets and wire fencing, and even adopted rehomed animals to grow their flock. \"We've never bought anything new. Everything we've ever had was used,\" says Rachael. That reality can be difficult, she says, \"sometimes you get to this point where you think you don't deserve anything\", it's a mindset that \"minorities just always get the leftovers\".\n\nBut despite - or rather because of - that, Rachael says, she and James \"are trying to create a blueprint for people to follow\". Including their kids. \"Whatever we learn, we want to be able to pass on.\""

Over the past 20 years, it has methodically repopulated one area after another as its rhino population has steadily increased.

      "text": "In African Desert, Boom City of 1,198\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Norma Mohr Special to The New York Times\n\nGHANZI, Botswana-Travelers in the Kalahari Desert know they are in Ghanzi District when fences begin to appear on either side of the desert road.\n\nThe Talk of Ghanzi\n\nWith the exception of an occasional track that veers off to one side, there are no other signs of habitation until the road rises slightly toward a cattle quarantine station. It is on the outskirts of the town, of Ghanzi, population 1,198, where black civil servants govern, white families own the businesses and foreign experts help with development projects.\n\nGhanzi used to be a monument to hard times, but times have changed for this ranching community in an oasis of sorts in western Botswana. It may not look like the popular conception of a verdant island amid desolate wastes, but with an easily tapped subsurface water table and brown scrawny clumps of vegetation, it functions as an oasis in the Kalahari.\n\nWhile weather patterns have brought drought and starvation to Central Africa, record amounts of rain have fallen in this traditionally arid part of southern Africa. Oid springs are flowing again.\n\nWith beef in short supply ??n various parts of the world, there is an economic ??oom here, and cattle prices have quadrupled in a year. Most of the cattle of Ghanzi district are still owned by the white settlers or by investors who bought them ??ut.\n\nThe settlers are descendants of the stubborn farmers who trekked across 400 miles of desert by oxcart ??rom South Africa to escape eligious, economic, political and social pressures. The ??irst white settler of record was Hendrik van Zyl, a for??er South African Minister, who left his home country in 1874 after a scandal and a divorce.\n\nBut the onetime white ??onopoly on Ghanzi ranches has been broken since Botsvana gained independence rom Britain in 1966. Botsvana's Vice President owns wo Ghanzi ranches, and the Government is sponsoring a program to give small‐scale black ranchers a role in the ??attle economy.\n\nBusiness is booming in Ghanzi town, the district's commercial center, which has three general stores, a machine shop, a bank and a hotel, the Kalahari Arms.\n\nThe community is surounded by sand that to this ??ay as too soft and deep for\n\n?? proper roadbed. Dust dev??s, or whirlwinds of sand, are propelled by winds down he main track through own, and the strong desert winds also keep the windnills of Ghanzi whirling.\n\nThe austere one‐story comnercial buildings are widely ??cattered over the area, sep??rated by large expanses of ??andy hillocks empty of everything except desert ??rush and beer cans. The ??habitants, mostly black ribesmen, live in widely ??eparated houses or huts on he town's informally defined ??eriphery.\n\nMore Rooms at the Inn\n\n\"We can't keep up with business, Ghanzi is growing so fast,\" said Henny Venter, who manages the Kalahari Arms with her husband, Koos.\n\nA new wing with four ??ooms has been added to the hotel, bringing the total ??umber to eight. But already the place is too small, Mrs. Venter said.\n\nDuring the cattle sale in ??une, for instance, 12 people had to sleep on cots set ??p in the reception room, as ??peculators poured in from ??outh Africa and the ranch??g areas of southeastern Botswana.\n\nThe new development programs also contribute to the boom in Ghanzi. The black Government of Botswana, once viewed with apprehension by the isolated settlers, has attracted several foreign‐aid projects to assist in development.\n\nRecent mineral and gem discoveries, plus the virtually untapped huge water resources in the Okavango Swamp north of the Kalahari, help lure development investments. Copper samples have been found on some of the Ghanzi farms, but since the nearest railhead or paved road in the country is on the other side of the Kalahari, Ghanzi isn't counting on a mining boom soon.\n\nA recent visitor in town could meet Steve Stevenson, a rancher from Kenya, who is field manager for a new project sponsored by the World Bank, Sweden and the Botswana Government. He is helping establish 30 new ranches on the fringes of the old ranching blocks for black people of the district.\n\nPeter Kaseberg Olsen, a Danish volunteer, is work superintendent for a government building program. Among the several projects he is supervising is the construction of teachers' quarters for the new Ghanzi Setswana Medium School wost or town.\n\nMr. Olsen is responsible for a revolutionary development here-the hiring of two Bushmen, one as a laborer, the other as a maintenance man. They are the first Bushmen to be employed by the Ghanzi District Council, and their work is highly praised.\n\nThis is a major breakthrough in a community where popular opinion has been that these goldencolored little people-the average height of males is five feet-could never hold down a job or learn anything new. About 5,000 Bushmen live as squatters on farms across Ghanzi District.\n\nIt is estimated that in all Botswana there are 24,000 Bushmen, the remnants of a vanishing race of nomadic hunters. The total population of Botswana is about 600,000, and there is one telephone book for the entire country, with 79 pages including yellow pages.\n\nThere is a new hospital here, staffed by a Danish volunteer doctor, and the doctor's wife, Lisa Yder, has also been making changes in Ghanzi. She started a public library, the first in western Botswana, with the wife of Chris Sharp, a United States Peace Corps volunteer who was transferred recently from Ghanzi to a little village to the south, Hukuntsi.\n\nA Ma Wise's Store\n\nThe two women got 300 books from the National Library of Botswana, renovated two classrooms in the old secondary school and opened for the public last June.\n\nMrs. Yder is also handicraft agent for the Bushmen. On a typical morning there would be several Bushmen in her garden waiting with their tiny bows, ostrich eggshell necklaces and little leather aprons and skirts embroidered with beads. Mrs. Yder buys the items with funds from the government handicraft shop in Gaborone, capital of Botswana, and then arranges for transport.\n\nA short hike through the sand ends at Ma Wise's Oasis Store, where the wares include food, clothing and medicine. A truck from Lobatsi was parked in front while men unloaded new foam mattresses.\n\nA Heroro farmer pulled up beside the shop in his cart drawn by a team of four donkeys. The Heroro, a Bantu cattle‐herding tribe, came to Ghanzi after their war with the Germans in SouthWest Africa in 1904.\n\nA visitor to the store might meet Hubert de Frays. seix, a French musicologist who hitchhiked in from Lone Tree Pan, where he was re cording Bushmen songs.\n\nAcross the track from the store is the Ghanzi airstrip. The Barclays Bank plane was in on its weekly delivery and pickup mission. The anthropologist Margaret Mead had just left by plane following her first expedition to Kalahari Bushmen.\n\nMany of the newly prosperous Ghanzi residents depend on air transport for visits to the dentist or for vacations.\n\nThe desert road leading south is still impassable except by heavy vehicles with four‐wheel drive, and even these frequently get stuck in the sand.\n\nDown the sand track and around a corner is the Hollandia store. Recent customers there included Dieter Heunumann, a documentary filmmaker from the Max Planck Institute of West Germany, buying supplies for an expedition into the central Kalahari.\n\nTwo geese wandered in and out, and a flock of semitame guinea fowl were scratching in the sand outside.\n\nHere, as elsewhere in Ghanzi, the conversation dwells on two topics-the price of cattle and the weather.\n\nSomeone was saying that the old springs of Ghanzi, which attracted early set tiers at the end of the last century, are flowing again. One farmer was said to have recorded 85 inches of rain this year, quite a jump from the 18 inches that have been considered lucky.\n\nThe exceptional rains were also good for the desert truffles. Truffles spring up in profusion here after the rains and are an important food for the Bushmen. The Botswana Government has had them examined by the Food and Agriculture Organization and it was decided that this variety is very close to the astronomically expensive European truffle. But no one vet has come up with a feasible marketing plan.\n\nWith all these advantages, many here agree, Ghanzi is the best place to be for a businessman.\n\n\"If you can't make it in Ghanzi you can't make it anywhere,\" Mrs. Venter said.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "In African Desert, Boom City of 1,198\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Norma Mohr Special to The New York Times\n\nGHANZI, Botswana-Travelers in the Kalahari Desert know they are in Ghanzi District when fences begin to appear on either side of the desert road.\n\nThe Talk of Ghanzi\n\nWith the exception of an occasional track that veers off to one side, there are no other signs of habitation until the road rises slightly toward a cattle quarantine station. It is on the outskirts of the town, of Ghanzi, population 1,198, where black civil servants govern, white families own the businesses and foreign experts help with development projects.\n\nGhanzi used to be a monument to hard times, but times have changed for this ranching community in an oasis of sorts in western Botswana. It may not look like the popular conception of a verdant island amid desolate wastes, but with an easily tapped subsurface water table and brown scrawny clumps of vegetation, it functions as an oasis in the Kalahari.\n\nWhile weather patterns have brought drought and starvation to Central Africa, record amounts of rain have fallen in this traditionally arid part of southern Africa. Oid springs are flowing again.\n\nWith beef in short supply ??n various parts of the world, there is an economic ??oom here, and cattle prices have quadrupled in a year. Most of the cattle of Ghanzi district are still owned by the white settlers or by investors who bought them ??ut.\n\nThe settlers are descendants of the stubborn farmers who trekked across 400 miles of desert by oxcart ??rom South Africa to escape eligious, economic, political and social pressures. The ??irst white settler of record was Hendrik van Zyl, a for??er South African Minister, who left his home country in 1874 after a scandal and a divorce.\n\nBut the onetime white ??onopoly on Ghanzi ranches has been broken since Botsvana gained independence rom Britain in 1966. Botsvana's Vice President owns wo Ghanzi ranches, and the Government is sponsoring a program to give small‐scale black ranchers a role in the ??attle economy.\n\nBusiness is booming in Ghanzi town, the district's commercial center, which has three general stores, a machine shop, a bank and a hotel, the Kalahari Arms.\n\nThe community is surounded by sand that to this ??ay as too soft and deep for\n\n?? proper roadbed. Dust dev??s, or whirlwinds of sand, are propelled by winds down he main track through own, and the strong desert winds also keep the windnills of Ghanzi whirling.\n\nThe austere one‐story comnercial buildings are widely ??cattered over the area, sep??rated by large expanses of ??andy hillocks empty of everything except desert ??rush and beer cans. The ??habitants, mostly black ribesmen, live in widely ??eparated houses or huts on he town's informally defined ??eriphery.\n\nMore Rooms at the Inn\n\n\"We can't keep up with business, Ghanzi is growing so fast,\" said Henny Venter, who manages the Kalahari Arms with her husband, Koos.\n\nA new wing with four ??ooms has been added to the hotel, bringing the total ??umber to eight. But already the place is too small, Mrs. Venter said.\n\nDuring the cattle sale in ??une, for instance, 12 people had to sleep on cots set ??p in the reception room, as ??peculators poured in from ??outh Africa and the ranch??g areas of southeastern Botswana.\n\nThe new development programs also contribute to the boom in Ghanzi. The black Government of Botswana, once viewed with apprehension by the isolated settlers, has attracted several foreign‐aid projects to assist in development.\n\nRecent mineral and gem discoveries, plus the virtually untapped huge water resources in the Okavango Swamp north of the Kalahari, help lure development investments. Copper samples have been found on some of the Ghanzi farms, but since the nearest railhead or paved road in the country is on the other side of the Kalahari, Ghanzi isn't counting on a mining boom soon.\n\nA recent visitor in town could meet Steve Stevenson, a rancher from Kenya, who is field manager for a new project sponsored by the World Bank, Sweden and the Botswana Government. He is helping establish 30 new ranches on the fringes of the old ranching blocks for black people of the district.\n\nPeter Kaseberg Olsen, a Danish volunteer, is work superintendent for a government building program. Among the several projects he is supervising is the construction of teachers' quarters for the new Ghanzi Setswana Medium School wost or town.\n\nMr. Olsen is responsible for a revolutionary development here-the hiring of two Bushmen, one as a laborer, the other as a maintenance man. They are the first Bushmen to be employed by the Ghanzi District Council, and their work is highly praised.\n\nThis is a major breakthrough in a community where popular opinion has been that these goldencolored little people-the average height of males is five feet-could never hold down a job or learn anything new. About 5,000 Bushmen live as squatters on farms across Ghanzi District.\n\nIt is estimated that in all Botswana there are 24,000 Bushmen, the remnants of a vanishing race of nomadic hunters. The total population of Botswana is about 600,000, and there is one telephone book for the entire country, with 79 pages including yellow pages.\n\nThere is a new hospital here, staffed by a Danish volunteer doctor, and the doctor's wife, Lisa Yder, has also been making changes in Ghanzi. She started a public library, the first in western Botswana, with the wife of Chris Sharp, a United States Peace Corps volunteer who was transferred recently from Ghanzi to a little village to the south, Hukuntsi.\n\nA Ma Wise's Store\n\nThe two women got 300 books from the National Library of Botswana, renovated two classrooms in the old secondary school and opened for the public last June.\n\nMrs. Yder is also handicraft agent for the Bushmen. On a typical morning there would be several Bushmen in her garden waiting with their tiny bows, ostrich eggshell necklaces and little leather aprons and skirts embroidered with beads. Mrs. Yder buys the items with funds from the government handicraft shop in Gaborone, capital of Botswana, and then arranges for transport.\n\nA short hike through the sand ends at Ma Wise's Oasis Store, where the wares include food, clothing and medicine. A truck from Lobatsi was parked in front while men unloaded new foam mattresses.\n\nA Heroro farmer pulled up beside the shop in his cart drawn by a team of four donkeys. The Heroro, a Bantu cattle‐herding tribe, came to Ghanzi after their war with the Germans in SouthWest Africa in 1904.\n\nA visitor to the store might meet Hubert de Frays. seix, a French musicologist who hitchhiked in from Lone Tree Pan, where he was re cording Bushmen songs.\n\nAcross the track from the store is the Ghanzi airstrip. The Barclays Bank plane was in on its weekly delivery and pickup mission. The anthropologist Margaret Mead had just left by plane following her first expedition to Kalahari Bushmen.\n\nMany of the newly prosperous Ghanzi residents depend on air transport for visits to the dentist or for vacations.\n\nThe desert road leading south is still impassable except by heavy vehicles with four‐wheel drive, and even these frequently get stuck in the sand.\n\nDown the sand track and around a corner is the Hollandia store. Recent customers there included Dieter Heunumann, a documentary filmmaker from the Max Planck Institute of West Germany, buying supplies for an expedition into the central Kalahari.\n\nTwo geese wandered in and out, and a flock of semitame guinea fowl were scratching in the sand outside.\n\nHere, as elsewhere in Ghanzi, the conversation dwells on two topics-the price of cattle and the weather.\n\nSomeone was saying that the old springs of Ghanzi, which attracted early set tiers at the end of the last century, are flowing again. One farmer was said to have recorded 85 inches of rain this year, quite a jump from the 18 inches that have been considered lucky.\n\nThe exceptional rains were also good for the desert truffles. Truffles spring up in profusion here after the rains and are an important food for the Bushmen. The Botswana Government has had them examined by the Food and Agriculture Organization and it was decided that this variety is very close to the astronomically expensive European truffle. But no one vet has come up with a feasible marketing plan.\n\nWith all these advantages, many here agree, Ghanzi is the best place to be for a businessman.\n\n\"If you can't make it in Ghanzi you can't make it anywhere,\" Mrs. Venter said.\n\nAdvertisement"

In intimate gatherings in home parlors and speakeasies, a collective of the nation's most gifted thinkers convened. These \"salons\" inspired many Black writers, artists and creatives to produce literary journals featuring poetry and prose, but also visual art, sculptures and music.\n\nThese journals, widely known as zines, were radical in thought and design, pushing social and political boundaries within the few pages they possessed.\n\nU.S. Bank, in collaboration with T Brand, the content studio of New York Times Advertising, honors the legacy of the Harlem Renaissance with two zines - one dedicated to wealth's multifacetedness and the other devoted to celebrating the arts and culture.\n\nCurated by a new wave of Black creatives, including the typographer Tré Seals, the poet Mahogany L. Browne, the cultural critic and writer Michaela angela Davis, the collage artist Magdaline Davis and the photographer Ivan McClellan, these zines are poised to make an impact across the globe, inspired by those who started it all.\n\nWhat does wealth mean to today's Black dreamers and doers? Is it the inheritance of a family heirloom, the legacy of ancestral land or the passing down of wisdom from a beloved figure? Discover the myriad ways these visionaries are creating a legacy of wealth, opportunity and change, one bold move at a time.\n\nIn this first of its kind zine for U.S. Bank and T Brand, inspired by themes of the Harlem Renaissance, we focus on the ways wealth manifests for Black creatives, thought leaders and entrepreneurs. This collection of stories and voices, which features a family of fourth-generation Black ranchers, celebrates the impact of rich aunties and highlights the power of passing on family heirlooms, proves that wealth has more than one meaning.\n\nTradition is the force that binds us to our origins as time carries on. Through the exchange of ideas, radical self-expression and musical virtuosity, Black creativity knows no bounds. Meet the new vanguard in the fashion, art, music and food industries creating culture influenced by a bygone era.\n\nThe second installment of our zine series places arts and culture at the forefront of Black thought and creativity. Featuring discussions between Black trailblazers across various industries, as well as explorations of movement, artistry and style, we examine the Black cultural threads that connect us all. See how tradition inspires and fuels innovation today.\n\nThe news and editorial staff of The New York Times had no role in this post's creation."

      "text": "A Trophy Hunt That's Good for Rhinos\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Richard Conniff\n\nLet's stipulate up front that there is no great sport in hunting a black rhinoceros, especially not in Namibia's open countryside. The first morning we went out tracking in the northern desert there, we nosed around in vehicles for several hours until our guides spotted a rhino a half mile off. Then we hiked quietly up into a high valley. There, a rhino mom with two huge horns stood calmly in front of us next to her calf, as if triceratops had come back to life, at a distance of 200 yards. We shot them, relentlessly, with our cameras.\n\nLet's also accept, nolo contendere, that trophy hunters are \"coldhearted, soulless zombies.\" That's how protesters put it following the recent $350,000 winning bid for the right to trophy hunt a black rhino in Namibia. Let's acknowledge, finally, that we are in the middle of a horrific global war on rhinos, managed by criminal gangs and driven by a perverse consumer appetite for rhino horn in Southeast Asia.\n\nEven so, auctioning the right to kill a black rhino in Namibia is an entirely sound idea, good for conservation and good for rhinos in particular.\n\nHere's why: Namibia is just about the only place on earth to have gotten conservation right for rhinos and, incidentally, a lot of other wildlife. Over the past 20 years, it has methodically repopulated one area after another as its rhino population has steadily increased. As a result, it is now home to 1,750 of the roughly 5,000 black rhinos surviving in the wild. (The worldwide population of Africa's two rhino species, black and the more numerous white, plus three species in Asia, is about 28,000.) In neighboring South Africa, government officials stood by haplessly as poachers slaughtered almost a thousand rhinos last year alone. Namibia lost just two.\n\nTo be fair, Namibia has the advantage of being home to only 2.1 million people in an area twice the size of California - about seven per square mile, versus about 100 in South Africa. But Namibia's success is also the product of a bold political decision in the 1990s to turn over ownership of the wildlife to communal conservancies - run not by white do-gooders, but by black ranchers and herders, some of whom had, until then, also been poachers.\n\nThe idea was to encourage villagers living side by side with wildlife to manage and profit from it by opening up their conservation lands to wealthy big-game hunters and tourists armed with cameras.
