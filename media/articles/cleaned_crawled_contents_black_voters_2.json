      "text": "'We see him': Columnist says Trump's appeals to Black voters are 'insults'\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is making a campaign stop today in Georgia - a swing state he narrowly lost in 2020 thanks to high Black voter turnout for Democrats. But in 2024, Trump aims to peel off Black voters in his third bid for the White House. One columnist is crying foul on what she views as a cynical effort by the ex-president to hoodwink her demographic.\n\nIn her latest column for Inforum - the website for the Fargo, North Dakota-based Forum newspaper - professor Joan Brickner took Trump to task for his entreaty to Black voters, given his past actions and statements. She pointed to a February event in South Carolina, in which he spoke to a \"mostly white audience of the Black Conservative Foundation.\" She pointed out that the award the group gave him for being a \"champion of Black America\" was a \"made-up prize,\" and that the award was negated by his record.\n\n\"This is a man sued for failing to rent to Black people,\" Brickner wrote. \"This is a man who took out a full-page ad in The New York Times to promote executing the Central Park Five, Black and Latino men who had been convicted of raping a white woman - men later cleared, having nothing to do with it, after years of imprisonment. This is a man who has said neo-Nazis and KKK members in Charlottesville included 'fine people.'\"\n\nAfter the event Brickner referenced, Trump was widely panned for saying that his multiple criminal indictments and mugshots were the reason \" the Black people like me .\" Brickner said \"insults\" like that statement - along with another statement by Trump supporter Raymond Arroyo that his branded sneakers would endear him to Black voters because \"Blacks love sneakers\" - weren't fooling Black voters paying attention to his support of racist and bigoted politicians.\n\n\"We see him endorse Mark Robinson, the Black Republican North Carolina nominee who describes the LGBTQ community as 'filth' and attacks women in leadership,\" wrote Brickner. \"He wants to ban abortion with absolutely no exceptions and thinks we shouldn't teach social studies. But, he also says Blacks should be paying reparations to whites for the Civil War, as whites fought for Blacks; ignoring the trauma of slavery, the roughly 180,000 Blacks who fought and 40,000 who died.\"\n\nBrickner warned that Trump's racism was encouraging the worst elements of society, referencing white supremacist Darrell Leon McClanahan III's candidacy for the GOP's gubernatorial nomination in Missouri. She also reminded readers that Republicans today are attacking the legacy of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and that neo-Nazis were seen openly mingling with attendees at the 2024 Conservative Political Action Conference.\n\n\"The evil of hate - towards women, non-Christians, racial and ethnic minorities - still exists,\" she wrote. \"Truth must come before reconciliation. Truth and reconciliation are vital for our nation, for our world.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Turning Point USA (TPUSA) founder Charlie Kirk - one of Trump's leading supporters - aired a podcast episode on Martin Luther King day to besmirch the late civil rights leader's reputation, calling him \"awful.\" And during TPUSA's \"Americafest\" event in late 2023, Kirk told the conference's approximately 20,000 attendees that the Civil Rights Act - which desegregated public facilities and led to widespread integration throughout society - was a \"huge mistake.\"\n\n\"He's not a good person. He said one good thing he actually didn't believe,\" Kirk said of King .\n\nKirk later complained that the Civil Rights Act instituted a \"permanent [diversity, equity and inclusion]-type bureaucracy\" and that it was merely done as \"a way to get rid of the First Amendment.\" He also lamented that federal judges \"just yield to the Civil Rights Act as if it's the actual American Constitution.\""

      "text": "These Black swing voters resent the 'Trump okey-doke' - but aren't sold on Biden\n\nRight-wing media outlets have been claiming that Black voters are moving to presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump in big numbers. More and more Black voters, the claim goes, are realizing that they were better off under Trump's presidency than they have been under President Joe Biden.\n\nBut a group of Black male swing voters who got together in Atlanta on June 26 paint a very different picture.\n\nThose voters, according to The Guardian's George Chidi , are wary of Trump but aren't necessarily sold on giving Biden a second term either.\n\nREAD MORE : 'Paid in blood': How the loss of Supreme Court legitimacy can lead to political violence\n\nOne of them was Marc Boyd, an independent who, according to Chidi , \"cast a blank ballot\" when Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Georgia) was unsuccessfully challenged by GOP nominee Herschel Walker in 2022.\n\nBoyd told The Guardian , \"When I came in and saw the doggone sign 'Blacks for Trump' or whatever, I'm like: Well, that's the okey-doke. But I'm going to get their a**.\"\n\nBoyd, Chidi notes , holds a variety of liberal and conservative views - from being critical of gun control to pushing for racial justice. And he has little patience for the \"Trump okey-doke.\"\n\nThe June 26 event, which Trump called into, was held at Rocky's Barbershop in Atlanta's Buckhead area.\n\nAccording to Chidi , \"Since the night of the debate, Rocky Jones, owner of Rocky's Barbershop where Trump called in, says he was misled into hosting the event, which he thought would be a forum for Black businesses.\"\n\nChidi points out that Black voters in Georgia, which has evolved into a swing state after being deep red for decades, are crucial for Biden's reelection campaign.\n\n\"Much has been made of the purported gains Trump has made with Black voters in polls,\" Chidi explains . \"Those polls are questionable: a collapse in response rates has been coupled with tiny sample sizes and statistically illiterate reporting to present the impression of a meaningful shift. But small gains will matter in a state like Georgia, where about 30 percent of the electorate is Black.\"\n\nChidi adds , \"Black men have long been more likely to vote for Republican candidates than Black women are. They are also far less likely to vote, noted Stephanie Jackson Ali, policy director for the New Georgia Project.\"\n\nRead The Guardian's full article at this link ."

      "text": "Democrats are 'failing epically at reaching' Black male voters going into 2024: report\n\nAfter the 2022 midterms, the Associated Press reported that Republican candidates had been \"backed by 14 percent of Black voters\" compared to 8 percent in 2018. Nonetheless, Black voters in the U.S. are still predominantly Democratic, making them crucial to that party.\n\nBut in a Washington Post report published on July 31, journalists Colby Itkowitz, Sabrina Rodriguez and Michael Scherer emphasize that Democratic Party strategists fear Black voter turnout will be insufficient in 2024 - especially among Black men.\n\n\"Biden's election in 2020 hinged on narrow victories in states like Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania that former President Donald Trump had won in 2016,\" the reporters explain . \"Democratic activists are cautioning that the party can't afford to let support from Black voters slip.\"\n\nOne of the activists who is sounding the alarm is Black Male Voter Project founder J. Mondale Robinson. According to Robinson, Democrats aren't doing nearly enough to fire up voter turnout among African-American men.\n\nRobinson told the Washington Post , \"The Democratic Party has been failing epically at reaching this demographic of Black men - and that's sad to say. Black men are your second-most stable base overwhelmingly, and yet, you can't reach them in a way that makes your work easier.\"\n\nCedric L. Richmond, a senior adviser for the Democratic National Committee (DNC), told the Post that Democrats need to show Black male voters \"why the political process matters and what we have accomplished that benefits them.\"\n\nItkowitz, Rodriguez and Scherer note that Democratic organizers interviewed by the Post are \"less worried about Black women.\"\n\n\"Black voter advocates say the challenge is particularly acute among Black men, many of whom say they feel alienated from the political process and were hurt by policies pushed by both parties that led to increased incarceration and a decline in manufacturing jobs decades ago,\" the journalists report . \"Many say their lives haven't improved regardless of which party was in power, and are dispirited after the country elected Trump, life was upended by a global pandemic and violence worsened in urban areas.\"\n\nThe Washington Post's full report is available at this link (subscription required)."

      "text": "Criminal case proceeds against right-wingers who tried to 'hijack this boring election'\n\nJack Burkman and Jacob Wohl | DM photo via Flickr Public Domain\n\nThe Michigan Court of Appeals on Friday upheld criminal charges against two far-right operatives who prosecutors say made a series of robocalls in the state during the 2020 election particularly targeting Black voters in Detroit.\n\nMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced that criminal charges had been filed against Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl back in 2020 after it had been found that the pair had made about 85,000 calls spreading misinformation and fear about voting across Midwestern states .\n\nAfter hearing arguments concerning the case in November of 2023, the Michigan Supreme Court (MSC) supported assertions that Burkman and Wohl had utilized \"corrupt means\" and instructed the Court of Appeals to examine whether the pair's actions violated state election laws.\n\nThe Michigan Supreme Court concluded in June of this year that the defendants attempted to deter Black metro Detroiters from participating in the 2020 election using the \"immoral or depraved\" method of spreading election misinformation, particularly for mail-in voting, using \"racially based motives\".\n\n\"Defendants discussed their desire to \"hi-jack this boring election\" and arranged for the distribution of a robocall specifically to \"black neighborhoods\" with the call stating that the consequences of mail-in voting would include voter information being used by police departments to effectuate old warrants, by credit card companies to collect outstanding debts, and (potentially) by the CDC to support mandatory vaccination efforts,\" the MSC wrote in its opinion in June .\n\nIn that opinion, the MSC ruled that the Court of Appeals needed to review whether Burkman and Wohl's conduct violated Michigan law, specifically a section of election law pertaining to elector influence.\n\nMichigan's election laws say, \"A person shall not attempt, by means of bribery, menace, or other corrupt means or device, either directly or indirectly, to influence an elector in giving his or her vote, or to deter the elector from, or interrupt the elector in giving his or her vote at any election held in this state.\"\n\nOn Friday, the Michigan Court of Appeals found that because the calls directly pertained to misinformation about mail-in voting and promlegating false information in order to disrupt and deter Black voters in Michigan, they violate the law and Burkman and Wohl's criminal charges stand.\n\n\"There can be no reasonable dispute that voting by mail is a voting procedure. That is, voting by mail is \"a particular way of accomplishing\" voting, which fits the definition of \"procedure.\" The robocall was related to the procedure, because it alleged that, if a voter used the voting procedure identified, certain negative events \"will\" occur,\" Court of Appeals Judge Anica Letica wrote in the opinion.\n\nIn a dissenting opinion, Court of Appeals Judge James Redford argued that the robocalls did not pertain to voting requirements or procedures, but rather possible negative consequences of participating in absentee voting, so the court has not fulfilled the inquiries set out by the Michigan Supreme Court to uphold the charges.\n\nNessel applauded the court's decision saying in a statement her office looks forward to the case being brought to trial.\n\n\"Voter intimidation infringes upon the fundamental right to vote,\" Nessel said \"I am grateful the Court of Appeals saw this conduct for what it was-a gross misrepresentation of voting procedures meant to scare voters from participating in our elections.\"\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\n\nMichigan Advance is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

      "text": "Analysis highlights McConnell's misstated facts amid his fumble on Black voters\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) found himself at the center of controversy several days ago when he suggested that Black voters were not Americans. Now, the so-called facts that led to his assessment are also being scrutinized.\n\nA new Washington Post analysis written by Glenn Kessler breaks down why the top-ranking Republican's remarks and the data he used to arrive at his conclusion were relatively inaccurate. Amid growing controversy, McConnell conducted an interview to offer clarity on his remarks. But Kessler noted that the more interesting aspect of McConnell's interview centers on his \"factual dexterity\" as a result of him playing \"sleight of hand with the facts.\"\n\nStarting with the facts, Kessler laid out the significance of the Freedom to Vote Act which would trump the vast majority of state laws and place new nationwide standards on critical election components such as universal rules for voter identification, early voting, and mail-in ballots.\n\nHowever, Republicans have opposed the legislation arguing that it is unnecessary and could help Democrats tilt elections in their favor. McConnell initially aimed to point out that Black voter turnout has not waned in recent years.\n\nBut Kessler has explained why McConnell's interpretation was flawed as he presented a timeline of Black voter turnout over the last decade. \"Here's the trick McConnell is playing,\" Kessler wrote. \"He's comparing Black turnout to overall turnout. These are not comparable data sets.\"\n\nThe breakdown McConnell offered to back his claims also failed to convey the message he'd hoped.\n\n\"On the face of it, his comment would appear only slightly overstated,\" Kessler wrote. \"A McConnell spokesman directed us to census data showing that Black turnout was relatively close to overall turnout in recent elections. That's not \"just as high\" as McConnell claimed, but maybe it's close enough for government work?\"\n\n\"This statement is false, according to the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey Voting and Registration Supplement,\" McDonald wrote in an email. \"Non-Hispanic African Americans currently have lower turnout rates than non-Hispanic Whites in the 2020 and 2016 elections.\"\n\nAccording to McConnell's spokesperson, the lawmaker's staff had conducted research on data from the Current Population Survey. Based on their findings, \"the states affected by the Voting Rights Act, the gap between Black and White turnout was much smaller than the national average.\" They also included a number of examples below:\n\nIn a recent statement, McConnell's spokesman wrote: \"The successes in former preclearance states post-Shelby County is weighed down with states like Oregon, a deep blue state which mails every voter a ballot and has Black turnout 28.5% below white turnout; Colorado, a blue state which has a 18.2% delta with the same voting systems as Oregon; Washington, with a 21.3% average delta between white turnout and black turnout; and Massachusetts, which had the worst Black voter turnout in the country.\"\n\nKessler went on to dismantle that claim, as well. \"But there's a catch,\" Kessler noted. \"Apparently, Black voters in the South are more likely to respond to the census voting questions than those outside the South. That results in a lot of missing data - and the Census Bureau has chosen to count the missing data as 'did not vote.'\"\n\n\"When you remove the missing data, the comparison turnout between the South and non-South changes, and between Whites and non-Whites in Southern states,\" said McDonald, from the University of Florida. \"For some reason, Massachusetts has one of the largest African-American nonresponse rates.\"\n\nIn areas with a lower percentage of Black voters, Kessler also argues that the estimates are \"unreliable.\" A Census Bureau spokesperson has also shed light on the flaw.\n\n\"If a respondent does not respond to our question of whether they voted, then we do not consider them to have voted. In other words, if they have no response, we do not consider them to have voted. We calculate voters as those who report voting, and nonvoters as those who report not voting,\" the spokesperson said.\n\n\"Data users should adjust their analysis to account for the fact that we do not exclude non-respondents from the voting-age population and that we do not know whether non-respondents voted or did not vote.\"\n\nAccording to Kessler, McConnell's latest blunder has earned him two Pinocchios."

      "text": "Red state voters deliver 'full-throated rejection' of GOP governor's 4 constitutional amendments\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump listens as Governor of Louisiana Jeff Landry delivers remarks, in the Roosevelt Room at the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 24, 2025. REUTERS/Carlos Barria\n\nIn a stunning rejection of Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, Louisiana voters turned down all four of his constitutional amendments Saturday, including the governor's plan to overhaul the state's tax and budget laws.\n\nNearly two-thirds of voters rejected all of the amendments in an election that could have broader political implications for the rest of Landry's term.\n\nThe governor, who has sometimes relied on strong-arm tactics to get his agenda through the Louisiana Legislature, could become more vulnerable to pushback after failing to pass his most ambitious policy proposal at the ballot box.\n\nLandry's priority for the election, Amendment 2, would have lowered the maximum income tax rate the state could enact and restricted annual state budget increases. It also would have made it more difficult to enact new tax breaks.\n\nThe proposal was expected to produce a financial windfall for Landry and state legislators later this year. Amendment 2 would have moved hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue from state savings accounts into Louisiana's general fund, where Landry and state legislators could have spent it more easily.\n\nLandry had attempted to sweeten voters on Amendment 2 by tying it to compensation for public school teachers. Had it passed, temporary stipends worth $2,000 and $1,000 that teachers and school support staff have received for the past two years were expected to become permanent. Now, the educators are at risk of a pay cut since Landry hasn't included money for their stipend in his current budget proposal.\n\nIn a statement after the outcome was certain, the governor attributed the defeat of Amendment 2 to billionaire George Soros, a Hungarian-born Holocaust survivor who conservatives have targeted for several years for his support of liberal causes.\n\n\"Soros and far left liberals poured millions into Louisiana with propaganda and outright lies about Amendment 2,\" Landry said. \"Although we are disappointed in tonight's results, we do not see this as a failure. We realize how hard positive change can be to implement in a State that is conditioned for failure. ... This is not the end for us, and we will continue to fight to make the generational changes for Louisiana to succeed.\"\n\nThe most recent tax records available show Soros' Open Societies Foundations gave $1.25 million in 2023 to an affiliate of the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit with revenue totaling $260 million that put money into efforts to defeat Amendment 3. It's not clear whether any of the Soros' foundation's 2023 donation was spent in Louisiana on the election.\n\nLandry had support for Amendment 2 from another controversial billionaire. Conservative Republican Charles Koch is the founder of Americans for Prosperity, a group that knocked on doors, ran phone banks and sent out direct mail in favor of the proposal.\n\nOpponents of Amendment 2 celebrated its defeat Saturday night. They include William Most, an attorney who unsuccessfully sued to have the proposal removed from the ballot. He has argued that the language put before voters was convoluted and misleading, making it illegal.\n\n\"I think this is a full-throated rejection of attempts to trick Louisiana voters into voting for something they don't want,\" Most said. \"... This sends a clear message that if state officials want to change our constitution, they can't do it through trickery or deceit.\" Landry and the Republican-dominated legislature might have inadvertently stirred up public opposition to Amendment 2 by putting it on the same ballot as Amendment 3, a juvenile justice measure that drew the ire of Democrats and national anti-incarceration groups.\n\nAmendment 3, which 66% of voters opposed, would have made it easier to send more minors to adult jails and prisons for longer sentences. It spurred national criminal justice reform organizations, such as the Vera Institute and Southern Poverty Law Center, to spend more than $500,000 to turn voters against it.\n\nSarah Omojola, Louisiana director for the Vera Institute, said the results for Amendment 3 show voters are starting to reject incarceration as the sole option for criminal justice. She added that high incarceration rates have only served to destabilize communities rather than reduce crime.\n\n\"In defeating Amendment 3, voters made clear their desire for the things that actually make our communities safer - like quality education and opportunity,\" Omojola said in a statement.\n\nWhile those organizations focused on defeating Amendment 3, they also became the backbone of a \"No on All\" campaign working to vote down all four of the constitutional amendments Landry was pushing.\n\nSupporters of the tax proposal in Amendment 2 said they believed the criminal justice issue had a negative effect on their measure in interviews earlier this week. \"[Amendment 3] is a huge motivation of the groups that are saying no to everything. That seems to be the motivating factor,\" said Daniel Erspamer, CEO of the Pelican Institute, a conservative think tank that helped push the tax and budget amendment.\n\nLandry's team started to see trouble during the early voting period for the election. John Couvillon, an experienced Louisiana pollster, said Democrats and Black voters showed up in far greater numbers than Republicans during the early voting period. \"I have just never seen an early vote this strong [for Democrats],\" Couvillon said.\n\nIn addition to Amendment 3, Couvillon said left-leaning voters may also be motivated to vote against Republicans because of concerns about President Donald Trump . Landry is also closely aligned with the Trump administration.\n\nHowever, opposition to Amendment 2, and the budget and tax changes, also came from some conservative activists. Religious groups and nonprofits were unhappy the amendment would have weakened constitutional protections for property tax exemptions they enjoy. Woody Jenkins, chairman of the East Baton Rouge Republican Party and a former state representative, was among those who opposed the amendment. In an interview Saturday night, he noted that even though the \"entire political establishment of the state\" supported the proposals, voters had an especially hard time digesting Amendment 2.\n\n\"Members of the public don't want to vote on something they don't understand,\" Jenkins said. \"... They don't want a massive revision of the constitution with everything but the kitchen sink in it.\"\n\nThe defeat of Amendments 2 and 3 also likely led to the downfall of Amendment 1, which failed with 65% of voters against the proposal. It would have allowed the formation of specialty courts in Louisiana with jurisdiction outside current parish and judicial districts.\n\nAmendment 4 also failed, with 64% of voters. It would have adjusted the rules for special elections to fill vacant or new judgeships, primarily on the Louisiana Supreme Court."
