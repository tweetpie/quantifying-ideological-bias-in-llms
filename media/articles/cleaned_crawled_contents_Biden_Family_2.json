      "text": "House Republicans say 'top priority' is to probe Biden family\n\nOne day after retaking a majority in the US House of Representatives, Republicans have said they will investigate the president's family as a \"top priority\".\n\nThe lawmakers said the inquiry would focus on overseas business dealings of the president's son, Hunter Biden.\n\nThe 52-year-old is already under federal investigation, but has so far not faced any charges.\n\nThe younger Biden is not involved with the administration in any capacity.\n\nBut top Republicans insist their inquiry will determine the extent of Joe Biden's alleged involvement in his son's business dealings, including during the elder Biden's time as vice-president.\n\nIn an interim report released at a press conference on Thursday, they argued that the president had lied to the American people about his alleged involvement in his family's business dealings.\n\n\"The president's participation in enriching his family is, in a word, abuse of the highest order,\" said James Comer, the incoming chairman of the House Oversight Committee.\n\n\"I want to be clear: this is an investigation of Joe Biden, and that's where our focus will be next Congress.\"\n\nThey accused Hunter Biden of crimes including tax evasion and wire fraud, but did not announce any immediate plans to summon him to testify.\n\nChristopher Clark, a lawyer for Hunter Biden, told the BBC his client had no comment about the Republican announcement.\n\nMr Comer was joined at the press conference by congressman Jim Jordan, who is expected to become chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe Ohio Republican later tweeted: \"The Biden Family's business deals are a national security threat.\"\n\nOfficials with the Democratic National Committee have hit back by circulating a memo that refers to Mr Comer, a Kentucky congressman, as \"a Trump apologist who has made clear that his phony investigations are political exercises designed to hurt President Biden\".\n\nThe White House said the inquiries were politically motivated.\n\nSpokesman Ian Sams said: \"Instead of working with President Biden to address issues important to the American people, like lower costs, congressional Republicans' top priority is to go after President Biden with politically motivated attacks chock-full of long-debunked conspiracy theories.\"\n\nA report released by Senate Republicans in September 2020 found that Hunter Biden had \"cashed in\" on his father's position, but the findings did not implicate his father in wrongdoing.\n\nThe newly announced investigation is one of many that House Republicans could lead. Others include the Biden administration's troop withdrawal from Afghanistan and its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe select committee investigating the 6 January 2021 riot by Trump supporters on Capitol Hill will be dissolved when the new Congress takes over.\n\nRank-and-file Republican lawmakers have nominated Kevin McCarthy, the current minority leader, as their choice for House Speaker when a new Congress convenes in January.\n\nIf elected, the California congressman would succeed long-time Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who announced on Thursday that she is stepping down from her leadership post.\n\nMr McCarthy has suggested that a Republican majority will pull back on funding for Ukraine, but he must contend with a narrow majority in the chamber.\n\nDemocrats will meanwhile retain power in the Senate, the upper chamber of Congress.\n\nThe former US president says his successor has \"done so much damage and so much destruction\" in his first days in office.\n\nThe ex-president uses the speech to criticise the Trump administration's cuts to the welfare agency.\n\nThe US president apportioned blame to Ukraine's leader hours after the deadliest strike on civilians this year.\n\nThe US president also confirmed he was revoking the security clearance of Joe Biden and \"any other member\" of the Biden family.\n\nPresident Trump claims \"many\" of Biden's pardons are void because they were signed automatically and not by hand.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "President Biden's son Hunter and brother James subpoenaed in impeachment probe\n\nCongressional Republicans have issued legal summons to several members of the Biden family in an escalation of their impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee subpoenaed Mr Biden's son Hunter, his brother James, and Biden family associate Rob Walker.\n\nIt is also requesting transcribed interviews with five others.\n\nThe White House accused Republicans of \"abusing their power to conduct a smear campaign\".\n\nHouse Republicans opened their impeachment inquiry in September, saying they had uncovered evidence of President Biden's knowledge of and role in his family members' domestic and foreign business dealings.\n\nBut at the Oversight Committee's first hearing that month, witnesses and even Republicans on the panel said more evidence was needed to determine if the president had committed any impeachable offenses.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, the House Oversight Committee said it had obtained financial records that showed Biden family members allegedly set up more than 20 shell companies during Joe Biden's vice presidency in order to hide payments they received from overseas.\n\nThe committee further charged that the Biden family, its associates, and its companies had received more than $24m (£20m) from foreign nations, including some viewed as US adversaries.\n\n\"The House Oversight Committee has followed the money and built a record of evidence revealing how Joe Biden knew, was involved, and benefited from his family's influence peddling schemes,\" Chairman James Comer, of Kentucky, said.\n\n\"Now, the House Oversight Committee is going to bring in members of the Biden family and their associates to question them on this record of evidence.\"\n\nHunter Biden was ordered to testify under oath before the committee on 13 December, while James Biden and Mr Walker were asked to appear on 6 December and 29 November respectively.\n\nThe committee also called on Hunter's wife Melissa Cohen, James' wife Sara Biden, Hunter's brother's widow Hallie Biden and her sister Elizabeth Secundy and Hunter's ex-business partner Tony Bobulinski to provide transcribed interviews.\n\nThe White House was quick to respond, sending out a memo after the subpoenas were issued that accused Republicans of making \"this partisan investigation a higher priority than virtually all issues Americans really care about\".\n\nSpeaking at the daily White House briefing, Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said: \"This is an investigation that has been going on for a year now and has turned up zero evidence of wrongdoing by the president because there is none.\"\n\nIn a statement to the BBC's US partner CBS News, Hunter Biden's lawyer indicated he would comply with the subpoena.\n\n\"This is yet another political stunt aimed at distracting from the glaring failure of Rep. Comer and his MAGA [Make America Great Again] allies to prove a single one of their wild and now discredited conspiracies about the Biden family,\" Abbe Lowell said.\n\n\"Nevertheless, Hunter is eager to have the opportunity, in a public forum and at the right time, to discuss these matters with the Committee.\"\n\nMr Comer indicated on X, formerly known as Twitter, that more subpoenas will follow in coming days as part of the investigation.\n\nWednesday's subpoenas and interview requests come one day after the special counsel overseeing a federal probe into Hunter Biden testified to lawmakers behind closed doors.\n\nIn that hearing, David Weiss refuted Republican assertions that the White House is interfering with his investigation, saying he was \"not blocked, or otherwise prevented from pursuing charges\" against the president's son.\n\nThe younger Mr Biden is currently facing three federal gun charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThat investigation is still ongoing.\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nGiuffre alleged she was trafficked to the Duke of York when she was 17, which he has strenuously denied.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

It does not allege illegal conduct.\n\nThe White House called the findings \"baseless innuendo\".\n\nThe roughly 30-page report detailed what lawmakers say are various companies and financial records tied to family members of Mr Biden, including his son, Hunter Biden, and daughter-in-law, Hallie Biden.\n\nIt contains records of bank transactions, obtained through subpoena, that Republican lawmakers say are linked to Romania and China.\n\nThe bank records show the receipt of money from a foreign company connected to Gabriel Popoviciu, who was prosecuted for corruption in Romania, reports the New York Times .\n\n\"We believe that the president has been involved in this from the very beginning.

His defense centers on whether he knowingly lied on the gun-purchase form, where he said he was not using illegal drugs, a required condition for buying firearms. If convicted, he could be sentenced to prison.\n\nMr. Biden has also been indicted on federal charges of tax evasion, a case scheduled for trial in California in September. The two cases stem from the implosion of a plea deal last summer that would have immunized the first son from future potential charges.\n\nFor President Joe Biden, whose life has been marked by tragedy, son Hunter's gun trial adds family drama - and a supercharged legal dimension - to an already unusual presidential election.\n\nThe Hunter Biden case pales in significance to the legal woes of former President Donald Trump, who was found guilty last month of falsifying business records in a hush-money deal with a porn star. Mr. Trump, the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee in November, has also been indicted in three other criminal cases.\n\nHunter Biden, of course, isn't running for office - let alone reelection as president, as his father is. And certainly the specter of a presidential relative facing personal and legal problems is nothing new. Throughout history, many presidents have had family members who have attracted embarrassing (or worse) public attention.\n\nBut for President Joe Biden, whose life has been marked by tragedy, his son's saga represents an unprecedented dimension in the heat of a presidential election campaign already unlike any other.\n\nAs a political matter, the Hunter Biden gun case is unlikely to have an impact, analysts say. Even if voters across the political spectrum themselves have experience with relatives struggling with addiction, \"I suspect reactions will be heavily dependent on party ID,\" says Michael Traugott, a presidential scholar emeritus at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.\n\n\"Republicans, especially, are not likely to be swayed by this in any positive way or accept a very sympathetic view,\" Professor Traugott says.\n\nPresident Biden has sought to avoid an appearance of conflict of interest. When asked last week in an ABC News interview if he would accept the outcome of his son's trial, he said \"yes.\" The president also ruled out a pardon in the event of a conviction.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Biden accused Mr. Trump of trying to undermine the rule of law in the former president's claim that his conviction last month in a New York state case was politically motivated. Two of Mr. Trump's remaining cases are federal, sparking accusations by the former president and his allies that the Biden administration has weaponized the Justice Department against him.\n\nThat the Hunter Biden case is also federal cuts a bit into that argument, as have federal indictments of two Democratic lawmakers - Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas.\n\nBiden critics counter that the earlier Hunter Biden plea deal was a \"sweetheart\" arrangement by his father's Justice Department that collapsed at the last minute only because the judge blew the whistle.\n\nHouse Republicans also intend to keep pursuing their investigation into Hunter Biden's business dealings, which they say also implicates the president. Last week, the Republican chairs of three House committees urged the Justice Department to charge Hunter Biden and the president's brother James Biden with making false statements to Congress. The allegations come within an ongoing impeachment inquiry into President Biden.\n\n\"Now, we're going to do everything we can to hold Hunter Biden and all the different shady associates accountable. This is just the beginning,\" House Oversight Committee chair James Comer said Sunday on Fox Business. \"But the next step will be accountability for Joe Biden.\"\n\nThe impeachment inquiry into President Biden has so far failed to surface firm evidence of wrongdoing, despite claims that he had abused his office for financial gain. But if Mr. Trump wins in November, he has suggested he will seek legal retribution against his political enemies, including Mr. Biden.\n\nFor the president, the trial of his son represents nothing less than the latest chapter in a life marked by tragedy. Early in his political career, President Biden lost his first wife - Hunter's mother - in a car crash, along with the Bidens' baby daughter when Hunter and his brother, Beau, were young boys. Beau Biden, seen as the family's rising political star, died of cancer in 2015.\n\nAfter that loss, Hunter Biden went into a spiral of drug abuse and infidelity, destroying his marriage. After Beau's death, Hunter and Beau's widow, Hallie Biden, became romantically involved, ensnaring her as well in drug use for a time. Both Hallie Biden and Hunter Biden's ex-wife, Kathleen Buhle, testified at the trial for the prosecution, in an extraordinary airing of family dysfunction unprecedented in modern American presidential politics.\n\nHunter Biden's oldest daughter, Naomi Biden Neal, testified Friday for the defense, saying that her father had gained control of his drug abuse at the time he purchased a gun - an effort to show that Mr. Biden hadn't lied on his firearms application. But on cross-examination, the prosecution seemed to undermine Ms. Biden Neal's testimony by presenting contemporaneous text messages between her and her father portraying anguish over his behavior.\n\nBiden family members have shown up daily to support Hunter - including first lady Jill Biden, who shuttled back and forth between France (where her husband was traveling) and Wilmington. A remaining question, as the trial was expected to head soon to the jury, was whether Hunter Biden himself would testify. Monday morning, the defense announced he would not.\n\nThe jury deliberated for one hour Monday and is scheduled to resume Tuesday morning at 9:00 a.m.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But President Biden's announcement on Sunday has provoked bipartisan criticism. The pardon is unusual in that it is both for an immediate family member and exceptionally broad in scope. It also comes after the president said on multiple occasions that, out of respect for the proceedings that found his son guilty of multiple federal crimes, he would leave the convictions in place.\n\nA blanket pardon for the U.S. president's son adds a new strain on public confidence in the justice system, amid wider signs that federal justice isn't immune from the political divisiveness that has gripped America's public square.\n\nAnd the pardon comes as politics and the criminal legal system have become increasingly intertwined. Next month, Mr. Biden will cede his office to Donald Trump, who has been subject to multiple federal prosecutions himself and has said he will use the federal justice system to pursue his political enemies.\n\nAll told, the episode represents another blow to public confidence in the justice system - particularly its independence from politics. Mr. Biden's pardoning of his last surviving son may represent a measure of justice and compassion for some, but for others, it represents more evidence that the system is corrupt and broken.\n\n\"Both sides are using the justice system to justify political actions, and that is worrying about our time,\" says Jeffrey Cohen, a Boston College Law School professor and former federal prosecutor.\n\n\"Everybody can point to things that they view as unjust and a weaponization of the system,\" he adds. \"I hope we all see that it's just a race to the bottom, that it's not good for any of us.\"\n\nOver the summer, a federal jury in Delaware found Hunter Biden guilty on three felony gun charges. Months later, he pleaded guilty to nine tax-related charges, including three felonies. All told, he faced a prospect of decades in prison and over $1 million in fines.\n\nThe convictions came after yearslong investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and Republicans in Congress into alleged crimes committed by members of the Biden family. But in a statement released Sunday, President Biden said both prosecutions were excessive and politically motivated, justifying a pardon.\n\n\"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son,\" he wrote.\n\nStill, the statement made clear that President Biden was motivated not just by a perceived injustice, but also by his feelings as a father. Writing that \"raw politics\" had \"infected\" the prosecutions, he asked Americans to \"understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.\"\n\nMany presidents have issued pardons for relatives and political allies. But empathy for Mr. Biden's decision has been more the exception than the rule, even across party lines.\n\nMr. Trump, in a social media post on Monday, called the pardon \"a miscarriage of justice.\" Rep. James Comer, the Republican congressman who has led investigations into members of the Biden family for years , said in a statement, \"It's unfortunate that, rather than come clean about their decades of wrongdoing, President Biden and his family continue to do everything they can to avoid accountability.\"\n\nSome Democrats criticized Mr. Biden's decision. The pardon \"put personal interest ahead of duty and further erodes Americans' faith that the justice system is fair and equal for all,\" wrote Michael Bennet, a Colorado senator, on social media. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis echoed that sentiment in a social media post.\n\n\"As a father I certainly understand [his] natural desire to help his son by pardoning him,\" he wrote. But, \"This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later presidents.\"\n\nNot only has no president pardoned an immediate family member before, but Mr. Biden also issued an unusually sweeping pardon. He granted his son a \"full and unconditional\" pardon for all offenses he committed or may have committed, since Jan. 1, 2014 - a period including his final two years as vice president and his entire term as president.\n\nDuring his first term, Mr. Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner. He had served more than 16 months of a two-year sentence in federal prison and a halfway program for various financial crimes before he was released in 2006.\n\n\"The only real precedent for such a broad grant is [Gerald] Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon\" after the Watergate scandal, says Mark Osler, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law.\n\n\"Typically, a pardon grant is going to say, 'For this conviction,' or 'For this set of acts,'\" he adds. \"Here we have none of that.\"\n\nA regular citizen in Hunter Biden's position would likely not have received a pardon, experts say . But the pardon, and its broad scope, is undoubtedly a product of Mr. Trump's reelection last month.\n\nThe former and future president has spent the last four years fighting four criminal investigations, including two brought by President Biden's Justice Department into Mr. Trump's alleged retention of classified documents and his alleged efforts to stay in power after his 2020 election defeat.\n\nThose two cases are now winding down as Mr. Trump prepares to install new Justice Department leadership. Mr. Trump has maintained his innocence in all the cases against him and has said that if he regained the presidency, he would exact retribution on his political opponents.\n\nIn this context, Mr. Biden pardoning his son is both understandable and further damaging to a polarized and distrustful nation, says Cara Foos Pierce, an assistant professor at Southern Methodist University Dedman School of Law, in an email.\n\n\"While I understand his strong desire to protect his son from prison,\" she adds, \"President Biden is sending the message that the law does not apply the same to powerful, politically connected people as it does to everyone else.\"\n\n\"The idea that you can break the law with no consequences if you are close with the President is damaging to democracy,\" she continues.\n\nRepairing that damage will be difficult, experts say, but it could begin with Mr. Trump's next administration, if not sooner. The president-elect, however, has not signaled an interest in extricating the justice system from political fights.\n\nReinstating an executive order from the final weeks of his first presidency could give him the power to fire rank-and-file Justice Department employees who do not do his bidding. He has threatened to prosecute Jack Smith, the special counsel who brought the federal cases against him, as well as members of the Biden family. So has Pam Bondi , his nominee for attorney general. And Mr. Trump has said that he will issue pardons for at least some defendants convicted for participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection that sought to overturn his election defeat.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Trump's drive to surround himself with loyalists complicates efforts to restore perceptions that the justice system will act independently of politics.\n\nMr. Trump \"should fight the urge to put his outspoken supporters in leadership positions in federal law enforcement agencies,\" says Professor Pierce. \"If he does, he will be showing the country that he cares more about the rule of law than his personal feelings about how the justice system has mistreated him.\"\n\nThere's at least one way Mr. Biden could begin the work of repairing trust in federal justice, says Professor Osler: by using the presidential pardon power in a more conventional, impartial way. To date, he has issued fewer pardons and commutations than any other president this century, including Mr. Trump.\n\nThe pardon of his son is \"going to be a stain on his legacy,\" says Professor Osler, a former federal prosecutor and an expert in sentencing and clemency. \"The best thing he could do is to show this remarkable tool isn't just for his family.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Two were for making knowingly false statements about drug use on a 2018 firearms application at a Wilmington gun shop, and the other was for possessing the gun for 11 days.\n\nSentencing will take place on a future date. According to the statutes under which he was convicted, the younger Mr. Biden could face up to 25 years in prison, but with no prior felonies and having acknowledged his past drug addiction, he would probably face a far lesser sentence, potentially including probation, fines, and other conditions.\n\nThe guilty verdict against Hunter Biden is the first-ever criminal conviction of a sitting U.S. president's son. It came on a firearms-purchasing charge that's unusual for someone not accused of related criminal activity.\n\nThe verdict ends Part 1 of a unique episode in American history: the criminal prosecution and conviction of a sitting president's son. Part 2 begins Sept. 5, when Mr. Biden is slated to go on trial in California for federal tax evasion. The two cases flow from a plea deal, now defunct, that Mr. Biden struck last year with the Justice Department. The agreement would have ended his legal jeopardy over the gun and tax charges - and, in the eyes of his defense team, potential prosecution over his foreign business dealings.\n\nThat deal fell apart last July after two investigators from the IRS accused the Justice Department of hindering their investigation. Mr. Biden has lived under a legal cloud ever since.\n\nThe conviction in Wilmington - where the Biden family is considered political royalty - seemed to allay some concerns that the jury might treat Mr. Biden deferentially and acquit him, at least in part because of his family's prominence.\n\nBut another issue arises: Is Mr. Biden facing multiple trials because of his last name? This question brings up rough parallels with former President Donald Trump, who was found guilty of 34 felonies related to a hush money deal to silence a porn star before the 2016 election. For both individuals, supporters argue the defendants are being targeted for political reasons.\n\nMr. Biden's case holds much less national import - after all, he's not running for president, as Mr. Trump is (again) - but Mr. Biden's prominence still matters.\n\n\"What makes this complicated ... is that it leaves outsiders wondering whether Hunter Biden was selected out or whether this is just the inevitable result of a process that put him in the spotlight,\" says Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia University and former federal prosecutor in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.\n\nProsecutors, he says, generally pursue convicted felons who lie on gun forms, but cases like that of Mr. Biden, who had no prior convictions, are pursued less frequently.\n\nBut in Mr. Biden's case, the prosecution's case was helped by the defendant himself. The president's son had documented his drug use in a 2021 memoir, \"Beautiful Things,\" passages of which were played in the courtroom, with Mr. Biden himself having recorded the audio version.\n\nMr. Biden's infamous laptop also made an appearance at the trial. According to a report last week from inside the courtroom, a prosecutor waved the defendant's silver Apple MacBook Pro while reminding an FBI special agent of the data that had been seized during the federal investigation of Mr. Biden.\n\nThe politics swirling around the case are unavoidable. President Biden stated flatly last week in an ABC News interview that he would not pardon his son, and that he believed the trial was fair. (Mr. Trump, by contrast, has claimed the jury verdict in his recent trial was \"rigged.\") After the verdict, the president released a statement of support for his son, and said he \"will continue to respect the judicial process as Hunter considers an appeal.\"\n\nIronically, just hours after the verdict, President Biden made a long-scheduled appearance at a forum on gun safety in Washington, but he did not mention his son.\n\nAs the president gears up for the November election, there's no denying that his only surviving son's legal problems will weigh heavily. The president has been known to call Mr. Biden daily to check in, especially after he fell into an addiction to crack following the 2015 death of Beau Biden, the president's other son.\n\nWhether Americans will feel sympathy for the president's son, especially those who don't support his father politically, is open to debate. Mr. Biden is, after all, the son of privilege - a Yale Law School graduate whose father has walked the corridors of power in Washington for more than 50 years.\n\nBut as Patti Davis, the younger daughter of President Ronald Reagan, wrote in Monday's New York Times, living as the child of a famous father, under \"a glaring, unforgiving spotlight,\" isn't easy. Ms. Davis knows whereof she speaks, having struggled with drug addiction herself as a young woman.\n\n\"There are a lot of Hunter Bidens in this world, people who fell in way over their heads, who long for someone to believe they can recover and construct their lives differently,\" she wrote. \"You just don't hear about them on the evening news.\"\n\nPatrik Jonsson reported from Tybee Island, Georgia.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Now, for President Joe Biden, there's the added weight of a congressional impeachment inquiry and son Hunter's criminal indictment - all while pursuing reelection amid persistent questions about his age and stamina.\n\nBut President Biden is nothing if not determined, having finally reached the Oval Office 32 years after his first bid. Today, a strong desire to block his criminally indicted predecessor from staging a comeback only deepens Mr. Biden's determination. Devotion to family is another animating force.\n\nEven if the impeachment gambit by House Republicans can be framed as an effort to deflect attention from former President Donald Trump's legal troubles, it's still a serious matter for Mr. Biden - despite the lack of direct evidence that he personally profited from his son's business dealings.\n\nAn impeachment inquiry against U.S. President Joe Biden and the indictment of his son Hunter on federal gun charges could generate sympathy but also risk for his reelection campaign.\n\nRepublicans run the risk of perceived overreach, political analysts say. But that's likely of little comfort to Mr. Biden and his team.\n\n\"Nobody in the White House woke up in the morning and said, 'You know what would help us? Another scandal involving Hunter Biden,'\" says Jeffrey Engel, a presidential historian at Southern Methodist University. \"The 'what-about-ism' hurts, especially when the leading Republican candidate [for president] has been indicted four times.\"\n\nThe danger for Mr. Biden is that voters who aren't paying close attention may not see much distinction between former President Trump's criminal indictments and the Biden inquiry. \"What they hear is, something's not right,\" says Dr. Engel, director of SMU's Center for Presidential History.\n\nMr. Biden's close relationship with his only surviving son, Hunter - who has long struggled with addiction, but says he's now clean and sober - is another element that can cut two ways. To the president's political opponents, the younger Mr. Biden is a troubled man who profited off the family name in international business dealings during his father's vice presidency.\n\nTo the president's friends, the Biden family story is one of devotion in the wake of tragedy, including the death of son Beau in 2015 and before that, the car accident that killed Mr. Biden's first wife and baby daughter in 1972.\n\nToday, Hunter's struggles are, by many accounts, never far from his father's thought; the two are known to speak almost daily. And when asked by reporters about his son, the president either responds with a steely glare or a terse expression of support.\n\n\"The additional pressure he's had with his son, Hunter Biden, that's a tough thing,\" says former Sen. Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, a longtime friend of the president from their time together as senators. \"The problems Hunter Biden has had, you can't somehow put that all on hold. That's with you every day.\"\n\nIn June, the younger Mr. Biden reached a plea deal with prosecutors over federal tax charges that was expected also to help him avoid jail time over a charge related to purchasing a gun. But in July the plea deal fell apart, and last week, Mr. Biden was charged with lying about his drug use on a gun application. The indictment sets up the potential for a high-profile trial in the heat of the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nTroublesome family members aren't unusual in American presidencies, but the example of Hunter Biden - including his role in the business dealings under scrutiny by House investigators - may well represent a greater risk to his father's political fortunes than in other cases. Republicans have alleged the son received special treatment from federal prosecutors.\n\nThe Biden impeachment inquiry, while not good news for the president, is as much a reflection of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's political travails. After initially promising to hold a formal House vote to launch the inquiry, the speaker skipped that step, and announced the inquiry himself, when he apparently didn't have the votes. The Republican enjoys only the narrowest of majorities, and is operating under constant threat of a \"motion to vacate\" that could end his speakership.\n\nSome congressional Republicans oppose the impeachment inquiry. In a Washington Post opinion piece last Friday, Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado - a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus - accused his party's leadership of diverting attention from an impending government shutdown. \"Republicans in the House who are itching for an impeachment are relying on an imagined history,\" he wrote.\n\nBut even if the Biden impeachment inquiry is perceived by some to be political theater, history shows that investigations can go in unexpected directions. In the 1990s, the Whitewater investigation into real estate investments of President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Clinton eventually led to the discovery of President Clinton's affair with an intern - and his impeachment for lying under oath about that.\n\nWell before the Biden impeachment inquiry was formally launched, the Republican-led House Oversight Committee had already obtained thousands of pages of financial records that the committee chairman claims provide evidence of the \" Biden family's influence peddling schemes ,\" though it has yet to release that evidence. Now the committee is seeking more documents.\n\n\"If I'm Biden, I certainly don't want anyone digging around,\" says Chris Edelson, a political scientist at American University. Still, he adds, \"the Republicans to an extent are gambling. What if there's nothing?\"\n\nOn Sunday, Speaker McCarthy said on Fox News that House Republicans will eventually subpoena Hunter Biden. That, too, could be risky, as it could engender sympathy for the president's son, whose personal travails have been tabloid fodder for years.\n\nKathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, notes that many families have experiences with addiction. But in a political context, she asks, \"what is the capacity of a given member of the audience to experience empathy about this situation?\"\n\nWith Hunter Biden, \"are we now in a situation where if you're a Trump-supporting Republican, you won't experience empathy for someone in that situation?\" Dr. Jamieson asks.\n\nIn the Biden White House, answers to press questions about Hunter typically echo the president's six-word expression of support: \"I'm very proud of my son.\" Though on Friday, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre offered more: She stated for the first time that the president will not pardon his son or commute his sentence if he's convicted on gun charges.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

While walking across the South Lawn of the White House on Sunday, after landing in Marine One, a reporter shouted a question: \"What's your reaction to the impeachment inquiry?\"\n\nMr. Biden grinned broadly, and responded: \"Lots of luck.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Joe Biden voted for a bankruptcy law overhaul that benefited a major banking firm that was paying his son Hunter as a consultant.\n\nMore recently, President Donald Trump has seen everyone from foreign dignitaries to U.S. military personnel stay at his name-branded hotels - bolstering his family business income in what some see as a not-so-veiled attempt to curry favor with the president.\n\nTwo political families. Two situations that have drawn criticism or at least questions.\n\nTwo political families. Two situations that have drawn criticism. They're part of a troubling pattern, ethicists say: Real or potential conflicts of interest arise in Washington far too often.\n\nThey're part of a larger pattern, according to experts on government ethics. Real or potential conflicts of interest arise in Washington far too often, they say. Now, thanks to the impeachment trial and the 2020 election campaign, the issue is receiving new scrutiny.\n\nAlthough Mr. Trump is the focal point of Democrat-led impeachment efforts, his insinuation of financial wrongdoing on the part of the Bidens persists as a thread in the drama - and indeed is key to the president's defense strategy. Senate Republicans have been weighing whether the trial should include witnesses, and if so, whether to call Hunter Biden to testify about his position at a Ukrainian gas company during his father's tenure as U.S. vice president.\n\nYet as Republicans cast stones at the Bidens, they also live in a glass house. Political attacks about alleged financial self-dealing are likely to persist for both the Trump and Biden campaigns in 2020, whatever happens with impeachment. And on the substance of the issue, Mr. Trump appears far more vulnerable.\n\n\"What Hunter [Biden] was doing was not atypical for Washington - and also not good,\" says Robert Weissman, president of the watchdog group Public Citizen in Washington. \"That said, it is orders of magnitude less problematic and less corrupting than the everyday business of the Trump administration, including what the Trump family is doing to profit off of his presidency.\"\n\nHunter Biden's role on the board of gas company Burisma may have been inappropriate, Mr. Weissman adds. But that doesn't justify President Trump's pressuring of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens.\n\nDemocrats are arguing that seeking foreign help in an election is illegal, and the Government Accountability Office said the Trump administration violated the law by putting a hold on Congress-approved aid to Ukraine. The Trump defense team is arguing that there was no quid pro quo, and that even if there was it would not rise to the level of an impeachable offense.\n\nWhile Senate Democrats are eager to call witnesses, they are wary of any deal with Republicans that would allow Hunter Biden to be among them.\n\n\"The whole impeachment trial for Trump is just a political hit job to try to smear me,\" former Vice President Biden said at a Tuesday event in Iowa.\n\nStill, it's not just Republicans who have raised questions about possible conflicts within the Biden family. Press reports, including one headlined \" Biden Inc. \" by Politico, have cited cases over the years of Mr. Biden's brother James or son Hunter getting jobs or opportunities that appear to tap into their perceived clout as relatives of a powerful politician. The Wall Street Journal has drawn attention to Hunter Biden's business involvement in China , as well as Ukraine.\n\nLargely missing so far is any evidence that Joe Biden acted to provide favors to his family, including when he took the 2005 vote on the bankruptcy law while Hunter was earning fees from MBNA, a credit card firm in the family's home state of Delaware.\n\nAlso of note: In a chamber of many millionaires, Mr. Biden for decades ranked as one of the least wealthy senators (although speaking fees have pushed up his income in the past few years).\n\nBy contrast, the Trump family's combination of massive and ever-evolving real estate interests with the political power of the presidency has no precedent in modern U.S. history. And a number of lawsuits and subpoenas suggest that some of those entanglements may be crossing lines of legality.\n\nPresident Trump has officially removed himself from personal involvement in his businesses while in office, has been passing profits to the U.S. Treasury when representatives of foreign governments stay at his company's hotels, and is moving to sell that hotel. Still, many ethicists say such steps fall short of truly avoiding conflicts of interest, since Mr. Trump can't \"unknow\" the properties he owns and upon which his future wealth depends.\n\nYet, even as Democrats decry Trump family behavior and Republicans call out the Bidens' \"corrupt family business practices,\" it's not clear how much questions of financial impropriety will weigh on voters.\n\n\"The vulnerabilities are actually less than people are thinking\" for both political families, says Gregory Weiner, a political scientist at Assumption College in Massachusetts, and a scholar affiliated with the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\n\"I don't think what's going on in the Trump family surprises anyone, and I think his outlandishness in everything he does provides him a form of protection,\" he says. \"I'm not saying it should, but I think it does.\"\n\nIf Joe Biden becomes the Democratic nominee, Dr. Weiner adds, Republicans are \"probably doing him a favor by getting this [issue] out of the way early.\"\n\nStill, he says politicians ultimately risk ballot-box accountability if their actions become overly troublesome to voters.\n\nAnd experts say public officials' financial ethics are deeply important to the health of a democratic republic like the U.S.\n\nIt's probably not realistic to expect politicians to police all the professional activities of adult family members - other than to make plain that no political favors will be granted, says Richard Painter, a former ethics official in the White House of George W. Bush.\n\nBut he sees the Trump family entanglements as a different animal.\n\n\"This is a very serious danger, if the president himself has a lot of [business] exposure all over the world,\" says Mr. Painter, now vice chair of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\n\n\"What if Franklin Roosevelt during the World War II period had had all sort of real estate, the Roosevelt Tower in Berlin and in Rome?\" he asks. America is \"doggone lucky\" that was not the case, given that many rich Americans at the time had money in Germany and were isolationists, Mr. Painter says.\n\nFrom Saudi Arabia to Southeast Asia, Trump business interests overseas are considerable.\n\n\"Trump continued to hold more than $130 million in foreign assets in a revocable trust at the end of 2018,\" and has reported \"more than $100 million in income during his first two years in office generated by these foreign assets,\" writes Anna Massoglia, a researcher at the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington, in an email.\n\nBoth Mr. Painter and Dr. Weiner, among others, argue that President Trump should have put his assets into a blind trust, under which he would have exited from the business of name-branded hotels and resorts. It's a step that has been taken by past presidents , but none who had business enterprises on the scale of the Trump Organization (now led by the president's sons Donald Jr. and Eric).\n\nWhere some legal experts say it's unrealistic to expect an entrepreneur-turned-president to take such a drastic step, the rejoinder from others is that someone unwilling to do that doesn't need to run for president.\n\nAs it stands, while President Trump may have pledged to avoid conflicts of interest , he has left little scope for Congress, the press, or the public to assess his compliance:\n\nWhether for the Trump family's situation or for other presidents, solutions aren't easy. Corruption can be tricky to define, for one thing.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

In exchange, the president's son would avoid prison. The deal had elicited cries of favoritism from Republicans.\n\nThen, in a surprise, the agreement fell apart over questions from the judge overseeing the case as to whether it would immunize Mr. Biden from future potential charges, including unregistered foreign lobbying and more tax charges. For now, the president's son has pleaded not guilty to all existing charges, as lawyers for both sides prepare briefs in anticipation of resumed negotiations.\n\nThe drama in a Wilmington, Delaware, courthouse has raised the stakes not only for Hunter Biden but also for his father. What the Biden family had clearly hoped would be the quiet conclusion of a multiyear saga now threatens to become a longer, more complicated ordeal that could overshadow the president's reelection campaign. And it has given Republicans fresh ammunition as they explore the possibility - for now, still notional - of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nA plea deal over tax and gun charges against Hunter Biden fell apart Wednesday. The courtroom drama heightens the political risk for President Joe Biden and his campaign.\n\nHouse Republicans, who had labeled the younger Mr. Biden's original plea bargain a \"sweetheart deal,\" have been conducting their own investigations of his business dealings, as well as the Department of Justice's handling of his case. A congressional hearing last week featured testimony from two Internal Revenue Service agents who claimed that Justice officials slow-walked or otherwise impeded their investigation.\n\n\"By refusing to accept the plea deal, the judge signaled that there's more to the story than the Bidens claim,\" says Jennifer Lawless, a political scientist at the University of Virginia, in an email. \"But similar to the way that [former President Donald] Trump's multiple indictments don't seem to be hurting him among Republicans, it's hard to imagine that this will matter to Democrats.\"\n\nStill, she adds, journalists will now ask the president questions about this at every opportunity. And any minute he isn't talking about economic growth, reproductive rights, and legislative achievements is a minute lost.\n\nAt the White House briefing Wednesday, spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre framed the issue as a family matter and maintained that President Joe Biden has steered clear of involvement in his son's legal problems.\n\n\"The president, the first lady, they love their son, and they support him as he continues to rebuild his life,\" Ms. Jean-Pierre said. \"This case was handled independently, as all of you know, by the Justice Department under the leadership of a prosecutor appointed by the former president, President Trump.\"\n\nMs. Jean-Pierre was initially alluding to the younger Mr. Biden's struggles with drug addiction following the 2015 death of his brother, Beau. He has since paid back taxes, plus penalties and interest, for two years in which he failed to file returns. As part of the plea deal that fell apart, Mr. Biden would have avoided being charged for falsely saying he was not a drug user when he purchased a .38-caliber revolver at a Wilmington gun store on Oct. 12, 2018. He agreed to enter a pretrial diversion program under that deal.\n\nAdding to the political firestorm, House Ways and Means Committee Chair Adam Smith moved Tuesday to block the plea deal. The Republican filed a brief urging the judge in Wilmington to consider last week's testimony from the two IRS investigators claiming that the younger Mr. Biden had received preferential treatment.\n\nPresident Biden has faced continued allegations that he helped his son in his son's lucrative international business dealings - trading on the family name - and that the senior Mr. Biden benefited financially. The White House has repeatedly denied such assertions, but has changed its message from the president \"never discussed business\" with his son to he \"was never in business\" with his son.\n\nIn fact, it was President Trump's phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in 2019 requesting he \"look into\" Hunter Biden and his then-vice president father that led to Mr. Trump's first impeachment.\n\nNow, Mr. Trump faces multiple criminal indictments, including new federal charges expected soon over his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election result. And, to complicate matters further, he is the odds-on favorite to face President Biden in a 2024 rematch for the presidency.\n\nRepublicans are not sitting quietly by. This week, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said the House was prepared to proceed with an impeachment inquiry into President Biden, following allegations of corruption over his involvement in his son's business dealings.\n\nThe colliding legal and political dramas have transfixed Washington.\n\n\"Is it more important to look at criminal conduct by a sitting president or is it more important to look at criminal conduct by ... a son of a sitting president?\" Rep. Ken Buck, a Republican from Colorado and former federal prosecutor, said on CNN. \"That's going to be debated in public.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He was Delaware's attorney general and served in Iraq.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated June 02, 2015, 11:18 a.m. ET | Washington\n\nLet's put partisanship aside for a moment and remember Beau Biden, the man, and what he represented.\n\nMr. Biden, the former attorney general of Delaware and son of Vice President Joe Biden, died Saturday, eliciting an outpouring of tributes and sympathy for the Biden family.\n\nBut Biden was more than just the beloved son of a prominent public figure. In an age of sky-high cynicism over politicians and political institutions, he exemplified public service at its finest. He was a man willing to serve his state and his country, at times eschewing the more comfortable path.\n\nWhen Biden's father was elected vice president in 2008, the younger Biden could have been appointed to his father's Senate seat but opted to remain attorney general. He also went ahead with his year of service in Iraq as a judge advocate general for the Delaware National Guard.\n\nIn 2010, Biden surprised the political world again by not running for the Senate seat once held by his dad; instead he ran for reelection as state attorney general. Biden was in the thick of a high-profile criminal prosecution - of a Delaware pediatrician accused of sexually assaulting several patients - and said he needed to focus on that.\n\nPolitical analysts at the time suggested Biden was sitting out the Senate race because it was a tough year for Democrats, and he might have lost. Indeed, we're not saying that Biden never made political calculations in his career choices - and if he did, there's no shame in that. Like members of other high-profile political families, three of whom are running for president in 2016, having a famous last name can cut both ways. Beau Biden benefited from being a Biden, but he also seemed keenly aware that that wouldn't, or shouldn't, guarantee him anything as he made his own way in politics.\n\nLast year, Biden had announced that he would run for governor of Delaware in 2016, and was strongly favored to win. His political future seemed limitless. He had his dad's smile, and a telegenic young family. But more important, what emerges in all the tributes, from both sides of the aisle, is a picture of a man of character - a quality that trumps policy positions for many voters.\n\n\"Beau had a warm and generous spirit,\" writes Rep. John Carney (D) of Delaware. \"He was a truly giving person, and he appreciated the good in others in the way we all should. He leaves a legacy of service, and also a great personal legacy that calls on each of us to be more gentle in our judgments and more gracious with our thanks. He was one of the best of the good guys.\"\n\n\"I never heard a disparaging word about him as a person,\" wrote former Rep. Mike Castle (R) of Delaware, who was widely expected to face off against Biden in the 2010 Senate race before Biden opted not to run.\n\n\"Beau served his country and the citizens of Delaware with honor and dignity,\" wrote Charlie Copeland, chairman of the Delaware Republican Party. \"He leaves behind a lasting impact on the world around him.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Beau and his brother, Hunter, survived the crash, and their father was sworn in at their hospital bedside. In his 36 years in the Senate, Joe Biden took the train home to Wilmington, Del., every night to be with his family.\n\nVice President Biden puts up with a fair amount of ribbing - including from President Obama - for his exuberant style and occasional gaffes, but regardless of one's political views, there's no denying that Biden, too, brings strength of character to his public service. The outpouring of support for the vice president since Beau's passing is a testament to the public regard not only for the son but also for the father.\n\nAlready a subscriber?
