      "text": "One privileged white dude's awakening to fascism's racist and misogynist subtext\n\nIt's the patriarchy, stupid.\n\nI'm not a fan of kitchen sink political strategy. Just throwing every issue out unprioritized dilutes us. It feeds the right's caricature of us as chicken littles running round with our heads cut off, bleeding hearts leaking out every which way\n\nI recognize that life is inherently unfair and that making any little part of it fair takes effort we each have in limited supply.  I don't want us whipsawed from one unfairness to the next. We have to fight smart which means prioritizing - triage, focusing on what we can improve. Like triage nurses, we don't want to waste effort trying to improve what can't be improved even though it should be, nor wasting effort trying to improve what will improve on its own. Triage is guesswork. I have my guesses.\n\nI've worried that gay and abortion rights might be killing our chances of addressing global priorities like the climate crisis. Though it's heretical I'd be for surrendering on abortion rights if doing so takes the steam out of the right. I've worried about fighting the right-wing coup while fighting for a black or woman president. It could be like fighting the ultimate battle with one hand off doing something else.\n\nReading a recent book \" How Fascism Works, \" by Jason Stanley, I now see how gay, racial and women's reproductive rights are always priority subtext.\n\nFascism is borne of the have's (by historical accident, us white male's) natural progression from privilege to cozy detachment to annoyance with all obstacles to rationalized annoyance to delusional self-assertion as the chosen people, eternally entitled.\n\nIt's a natural progression, just what you'd expect from an organism with language. What do you get when you cross emotions with language? You get language that rationalizes emotions. The haves justifying their having as though it were the natural order of things is just what you'd expect.\n\nFascism is the militant reassertion of paternalistic authority, a pecker-based pecking order with the fascist leader as the supreme father figure. Trump cult fascism fits Stanley's diagnosis perfectly. No wonder it marginalizes civil rights for women, gays and minorities, all of which are at cross purposes to fascism's goal: To rewrite history, making the white male great again by subordinating all to the father figure. It's the bible but not just - both secular or religious fascism are all about misogyny and xenophobia.\n\nThat diversity is a front-burner subtext doesn't compel me to drop strategic prioritizing. It's not like we have the power to bludgeon the backward right into accepting our diversity standards just because they're urgent. I'm still no fan of \"backfiring firebrands,\" leftist radicals who set us back by pushing too hard too fast without attention to what's politically, even humanly possible.\n\nStill, recognizing fascism as a militant absolutist reassertion of eternal god-ordained white male superiority gives me new context and appreciation for the front-burner subtext. The fascist's fierce and fearful opposition to women, gays and minorities is part of a larger plan: to make us all the supplicating subordinates not to big brother but big daddy, the boorish, profligate, monster-man who thinks he can do no wrong and therefore does lots of it."

      "text": "What White People Need to Learn\n\nInvariably, around February of each year, coinciding with Black History Month, you'll hear people asking, \"Why isn't there a white history month?\"\n\nDo these people mean we should condense all the American history centering around white people to just one month and devote the other 11 to people of color? Of course not.\n\nIt's readily accepted that white history is taught, year-round, to the exclusion of minority histories. But the literal history of whiteness - how and when and why what it means to be white was formulated - is always neglected. The construction of the white identity is a brilliant piece of social engineering. Its origins and heritage should be examined in order to add a critical layer of complexity to a national conversation sorely lacking in nuance.\n\nI'm guessing that's not what they mean, either.\n\nIn conversations about race, I've frequently tried and failed to express the idea that whiteness is a social construct. So, here, in plain fact, is what I mean:\n\nThe very notion of whiteness is relatively recent in our human history, linked to the rise of European colonialism and the Atlantic slave trade in the 17th century as a way to distinguish the master from the slave. From its inception, \"white\" was not simply a separate race, but the superior race. \"White people,\" in opposition to non-whites or \"colored\" people, have constituted a meaningful social category for only a few hundred years, and the conception of who is included in that category has changed repeatedly. If you went back to even just the beginning of the last century, you'd witness a completely different racial configuration of whites and non-whites. The original white Americans - those from England, certain areas of Western Europe, and the Nordic States - excluded other European immigrants from that category to deny them jobs, social standing, and legal privileges. It's not widely known in the U.S. that several ethnic groups, such as Germans, Italians, Russians and the Irish, were excluded from whiteness and considered non-white as recently as the early 20th century.\n\nMembers of these groups sometimes sued the state in order to be legally recognized as white, so they could access a variety of rights available only to whites - specifically American citizenship, which was then limited, by the U.S. Naturalization Law of 1790, to \"free white persons\" of \"good character.\" Attorney John Tehranian writes in the Yale Law Journal that petitioners could present a case based not on skin color, but on \"religious practices, culture, education, intermarriage and [their] community's role,\" to try to secure their admission to this elite social group and its accompanying advantages.\n\nMore than color, it was class that defined race. For whiteness to maintain its superiority, membership had to be strictly controlled. The \"gift\" of whiteness was bestowed on those who could afford it, or when it was politically expedient. In his book \"How the Irish Became White,\" Noel Ignatiev argues that Irish immigrants were incorporated into whiteness in order to suppress the economic competitiveness of free black workers and undermine efforts to unite low-wage black and Irish Americans into an economic bloc bent on unionizing labor. The aspiration to whiteness was exploited to politically and socially divide groups that had more similarities than differences. It was an apple dangled in front of working-class immigrant groups, often as a reward for subjugating other groups.\n\nA lack of awareness of these facts has lent credence to the erroneous belief that whiteness is inherent and has always existed, either as an actual biological difference or as a cohesive social grouping. Some still claim it is natural for whites to gravitate to their own and that humans are tribal and predisposed to congregate with their kind. It's easy, simple and natural: White people have always been white people. Thinking about racial identity is for those other people.\n\nThose who identify as white should start thinking about their inheritance of this identity and understand its implications. When what counts as your \"own kind\" changes so frequently and is so susceptible to contemporaneous political schemes, it becomes impossible to argue an innate explanation for white exclusion. Whiteness was never about skin color or a natural inclination to stand with one's own; it was designed to racialize power and conveniently dehumanize outsiders and the enslaved. It has always been a calculated game with very real economic motivations and benefits.\n\nThis revelation should not function as an excuse for those in groups recently accepted as white to claim to understand racism, to absolve themselves of white privilege or to deny that their forefathers, while not considered white, were still, in the hierarchy created by whites, responsible in turn for oppressing those \"lower\" on the racial scale. During the Civil War, Irish immigrants were responsible for some of the most violent attacks against freedmen in the North, such as the wave of lynchings during the 1863 Draft Riots, in which \"the majority of participants were Irish,\" according to Eric Foner's book \"Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877\" and various other sources.  According to historian Dominic Pacyga , Polish Americans groups in Chicago and Detroit \"worked to prevent the integration of blacks into their communities by implementing rigid housing segregation\" out of a fear that black people would \"leap over them into a higher social status position.\"\n\nBehind every racial conversation is a complex history that extends to present-day interactions and policies, and we get nowhere fast if large swaths of our population have a limited frame of reference. An understanding of whiteness might have prevented the utter incapability of some Americans to realize that \"Hispanic\" is not a race - that white Hispanics do exist, George Zimmerman among them. This knowledge might have lessened the cries that Trayvon Martin's murder could not have been racially motivated and might have led to, if not a just verdict, a less painfully ignorant response from many white Americans.\n\nThis comprehension of whiteness could also dissuade many white people of such detrimental and pervasive racial notions, such as, \"Why is black pride OK but white pride is racist?\" If students are taught that whiteness is based on a history of exclusion, they might easily see that there is nothing in the designation as \"white\" to be proud of. Being proud of being white doesn't mean finding your pale skin pretty or your Swedish history fascinating. It means being proud of the violent disenfranchisement of those barred from this category. Being proud of being black means being proud of surviving this ostracism. Be proud to be Scottish, Norwegian or French, but not white.\n\nAbove all, such an education might help answer the question of whose problem modern racism really is. The current divide is a white construction, and it is up to white people to do the necessary work to dismantle the system borne from the slave trade, instead of ignoring it or telling people of color to \"get over\" its extant legacy. Critics of white studies have claimed that this kind of inquiry leads only to self-hatred and guilt. Leaving aside that avoiding self-reflection out of fear of bad feelings is the direct enemy of personal and intellectual growth, I agree that such an outcome should be resisted, because guilt is an unproductive emotion, and merely feeling guilty is satisfying enough for some. My hope in writing this is that white Americans will discover how it is they came to be set apart from non-whites and decide what they plan to do about it.\n\nSo, yes, for one month, let's hear about white history, educating ourselves and others. Let's expose whiteness as a fraudulent schema imposed as a means to justify economic and physical bondage. Let's try to uncover the centuries-old machinations that inform current race relations and bind us in a stalemate of misunderstanding. Then let's smash this whole thing to pieces.\n\nThis piece is the latest in a series by feminists of color, curated by Roxane Gay. To submit to the series, email rgay@salon.com."

      "text": "What is white victimhood and how is it linked to white supremacy? A South African explains\n\nA supporter of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump rallies outside an early polling precinct as voters cast their ballots in local, state, and national elections, in Clearwater, Florida, U.S., November 3, 2024.\n\nAmerican president Donald Trump has issued an executive order to withdraw aid from South Africa. He was reacting to what he has called the South African government's plan to \"seize ethnic minority Afrikaners' agricultural property without compensation\". Afrikaners are an ethnic and linguistic community of white South Africans whose home language is Afrikaans.\n\nTrump's outrage is based on a misinterpretation of a new law - the Expropriation Act which  came into effect in January 2025.\n\nTrump's action, amplified by provocative comments from billionaire Elon Musk, has reignited debate about the concept of \"white victimhood\". We asked Nicky Falkof, who has researched the idea of white victimhood, for her insights.\n\nWhite victimhood refers to a powerful set of beliefs that treats white people as special and different, but also as uniquely at risk. Within this narrative white people see themselves, and are sometimes seen by others, as extraordinary victims, whose exposure to violence or vulnerability is more concerning and important than anyone else's.\n\nWhite victimhood is usually speculative. It relates not to actual events that have happened, but to white people's feelings of being threatened or unsafe. Entire political agendas develop around the idea that white people must be protected because they face exceptional threats, which are not being taken seriously by a contemporary world order that fails to value whiteness.\n\nThis is by no means particular to South Africa; we see it wherever whiteness is predominant. Indeed, ideas about white victimhood play a significant role in the popularity of Trump, whose call to \" make America great again \" harks back to an idealised past where white people (particularly men) could easily dominate the nation, the workplace and the home.\n\nThe South African case is important because it plays a central role in global white supremacist claims. These mythologies claim that white South Africans, specifically Afrikaners, are the canary in the coalmine: that the alleged oppression they are facing is a blueprint for what will happen to all white people if they don't \"fight back\".\n\nWe can trace this idea back to the start of the colonial project. In 1660 Dutch East India Company administrator Jan van Riebeeck planted a hedge of bitter almond shrubs to separate his trading station from the rest of South Africa's Cape. This hedge was part of a defensive barrier intended to keep indigenous people out of the Dutch trading post, which had been built on top of ancient Khoikhoi grazing routes.\n\nOn a practical level, van Riebeeck's hedge was meant to shield Dutch settlers and livestock from Khoikhoi raiders. On a philosophical level, the hedge situated the invaders as the \"real\" victims, who desperately needed protection from the violence and wildness of Africa. The bitter almond hedge is still seen as an enduring symbol of white supremacy in the country.\n\nThis early paranoia and securitisation has had a significant effect on white South African culture and anxiety. White people who can afford to do so barricade themselves in gated communities and boomed-off suburban streets, behind high walls topped with razor wire, on the assumption that they are the primary victims of South Africa's crime rate.\n\nIdeas about white victimhood have played a role in many of South Africa's most influential social formations.\n\nThe 1930s saw a major panic around \"poor whites\", which led to commissions of inquiry , upliftment programmes and other attempts at social engineering. The people and institutions behind these initiatives weren't concerned about poverty in South Africa in general, even though it was becoming more of a problem as the population urbanised. Their only interest was in poverty among white people, drawing on the assumption that it's wrong or abnormal for white people to be poor, and that this needed to be urgently remedied.\n\nThese moves were not simply about philanthropy and offering better life chances to poor people; they were about protecting the boundaries of whiteness. Poor whites were seen as a threat to the establishment because they proved that whiteness wasn't inherently superior.\n\nMore recently, the victimhood narrative has been a central part of the panic around farm murders and claims of \"white genocide\", an old idea that has been popularised and spread online .\n\nRural violence is a huge problem in South Africa that deserves a strong response. But white people are far from its only casualties. Indeed, violent crime affects pretty much everyone in South Africa. When the deaths of white people are explained as part of a targeted genocide undertaken on the basis of race, the message is that they matter more than the deaths of everyone else.\n\nAgain, this suggests a kind of naturalisation of violence and harm. When terrible things happen to other people they simply happen and are not remarked on. It's only when white people are affected that they become a pressing issue.\n\nWhite victimhood, like the racial anxiety it is part of, is not good for white people. It doesn't keep them safer or help them to live better lives.\n\nThat said, it's been quite effective as a mobilising tool. The apartheid-era National Party was skilled at using white fear for political gain. Its communications constantly played on white fears of the swart gevaar , the \"black danger\", which encapsulated the powerful belief that whites were more at risk from black people than vice versa, despite all evidence to the contrary.\n\nSimilarly, contemporary organisations like the Afrikaner \"minority rights\" pressure group AfriForum and the Afrikaans trade union Solidarity activate and manipulate white people's senses of extraordinary victimhood. This drives them further into a defensive position, where everything from farm murders and road name changes to the National Health Insurance bill is designed to attack them personally.\n\nWhite support for these kinds of organisations and the political positions they espouse, whether overtly or covertly, is at least in part driven by the effective manipulation of white victimhood.\n\nIt remains disturbingly powerful. The architecture of white supremacy depends on the idea that white people are extraordinary victims. This is the driving notion beneath the great replacement theory , a far-right conspiracy theory claiming that Jews and non-white foreigners are plotting to \"replace\" whites. It also underpins violent reactions to the global migration crisis and the rise of populism in the north.\n\nI don't think it's going too far to say that whiteness as a social construction is intrinsically tied to victimhood. The idea that whiteness actually makes people more rather than less vulnerable is likely to remain a central part of white people's collective psychic imaginary for some time.\n\nNicky Falkof , Professor, University of the Witwatersrand\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "10 Things Everyone Should Know About White Supremacy\n\nThe use of the phrase \"white supremacy\" is ubiquitous in American political discourse. This is a result of many factors. Primarily, the election of Barack Obama and the United States' changing racial demographics have created a reactionary backlash from white conservatives.\n\nWhite supremacy is referenced in relation to specific news events as well. For example, the murder rampage by the neo-Nazi Frazier Glenn Miller, the recent weeks-long debate between pundits Ta-Nehisi Coates and Jonathan Chait about \"black pathology\"; birtherism; stand-your-ground laws; and the open embrace of the symbols and rhetoric of the old slave-holding Confederacy by the Republican Party have been framed and discussed in terms of white supremacy.\n\nConservatives and progressive often use the phrase \"white supremacy\" in divergent ways. Conservatives use the phrase in the service of a dishonest \"colorblind\" agenda, evoking extreme images of KKK members and Nazis as the exclusive and only examples of white racism in American life and politics. Conservatives use extreme caricatures of white supremacy in order to deflect and protect themselves from charges that the contemporary Republican Party is a white identity organization fueled by white racial resentment.\n\nLiberals, progressives and anti-racists use the phrase \"white supremacy\" to describe the overt and subtle racist practices of movement conservatism in the post-Civil Rights era, and how American society is still structured around maintaining and protecting white privilege.\n\nThis analysis is largely correct: however, it often conflates concepts such as racism, white privilege, and white supremacy with one another. Language does political work.\n\nIn the age of Obama, the phrase \"white supremacy\" is often used in political discussions like an imprecise shotgun blast or a blockbuster bomb. If the Common Good and American democracy are to be protected-countering how the right wing has used the politics of white racial resentment, racial manipulation, and hate to mobilize its voters in support of a plutocratic agenda-a more precise weapon is needed. A necessary first step in that direction requires the development of a more detailed and transparent exploration of the concept known as \"white supremacy.\"\n\nWhat is white supremacy?\n\n1. White supremacy is a complex social phenomenon. It is also a relatively new invention that was created to make Europe's efforts to colonize and conquer the world seem like a \"natural\" process wherein \"superior\" white races would dominate \"inferior\" non-whites.\n\nThe Transatlantic slave trade was pivotal for the invention of race by creating a sense of group stigma and a belief in the concrete biological differences between white Europeans and Africans.\n\nIn the United States, a white supremacist racial order was birthed by a revolt in 17th-century Virginia, when black and white indentured servants allied together to fight for their freedom and rights. White elites defeated their rebellion and instituted a system of racial classification in which white indentured servants would be given land and guns after their service was complete while blacks would be made into a permanent class of slaves.\n\n2. White supremacy is comprised of habits, actions and beliefs. It is not necessarily reliant on the specific intentions of its actors, practitioners or beneficiaries. Of course, there are \"active\" racists whose intentions, words, and deeds are meant to advance a racist agenda. However, implicit and subconscious bias, as well as taken for granted stereotypes and \"common sense,\" can also serve a white supremacist order. Ultimately, intent is secondary to the unequal outcomes across the colorline that individuals benefit from and perpetuate.\n\nWhite supremacy also has the power to reorient and reimagine empirical reality for those who have consciously and/or subconsciously internalized and learned its principals and assumptions. White privilege is central here: those people considered \"white\" are also judged to be \"normal\"; the experiences of white people are taken to be universal and a baseline for how others are to be evaluated; African-Americans are judged en masse as having \"bad culture\" while whites are de facto viewed as having \"good culture.\"\n\nWhite people are viewed as individuals where the bad behavior of one white person does not reflect at all on the merits of the group. By comparison, African Americans and other people of color are not afforded that freedom. Ultimately, for white supremacy one's \"Americanness\" is naturally linked to one's whiteness, while the loyalty, and sense of civic belonging assigned to people of color, is contingent until proven otherwise.\n\n3. Images of terrorist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis serve as outlier caricatures of racism in the post-Civil Rights era. These cartoon versions of white racism do the work of white supremacy as a social and political force because they present virulent white racism as an anachronism or the habit of somehow damaged and defective white people who should be ejected from the public square. In colorblind America, \"polite\" and \"respectable\" white supremacy is far more dangerous to the life chances and safety of people of color than the overt racism of the Ku Klux Klan or other racially chauvinistic organizations.\n\n4. In the most basic sense, white supremacy is a philosophical, material, ethical, economic, scientific, religious, and political system that works to maintain the dominant and relative superior group position of those identified as \"white\" (and their allies) over those marked as \"non-white.\"\n\nThus, white supremacy is the philosophical and systemic umbrella for white racism.\n\n5. Racism and prejudice are not the same things. Racism is prejudice plus power. Racism is also the ability of one group of people to systematically impact the life chances and freedom of others who are deemed to be the Other.\n\nAlthough it is convenient and easy to believe that all groups in the United States are equally \"racist,\" such a claim is empirically unfounded. Moreover, such a fiction sustains white supremacy by ignoring the vast amounts of historical and contemporary evidence detailing how American society is politically, economically, and socially structured to the advantage of white people.\n\nIn the United States, white people are the dominant racial group. Of course, there are white individuals who commit active and intentionally racist acts. But, the most powerful manifestation of white supremacy as a type of group power is how individual white people in American society can still passively benefit from white racism and the psychological, material and political advantages it brings to their group.\n\nThe racial logic and commonsense of white supremacy (and a white racist society) is sustained by not asking about first principles. For example, what public policy decisions led to white Americans having at least 20 times the wealth of black Americans ? Why are urban black and brown communities economically disadvantaged, and white communities (i.e. the suburbs), have been materially advantaged by comparison? Whose interests are served by a criminal justice system that disproportionately and unfairly punishes people of color? 9. Colorblind racism is the most recent iteration in a white supremacist order where it is possible to have \"racism without racists,\" and a black American president, while social and institutional systems still privilege whites over African Americans and other people of color. White racial innocence, and a sincere belief by many white folks that they do not hold racist attitudes, or benefit personally or collectively from systemic white racism, is an example of how white supremacy has evolved to make itself relatively invisible (to willfully ignorant white people) as a dominant social force in American life. Consequently, one of the deep tensions and challenges surrounding racial discourse in post-Civil Rights America is how to locate a given white person's relationship to a broader system of institutional racism.\n\n10. Austerity, neoliberalism, globalization, and the culture of cruelty are some of the most powerful social forces in post-Civil Rights America. White supremacy does not exist separate or apart from those ideologies and practices.\n\nThe destruction of the social safety net and the siphoning of resources from the middle and working classes to the very rich is legitimized through a language which focuses on punishing the \"lazy\" and \"unproductive\" poor, i.e. people of color, in the service of \"efficiency\" and \"fairness.\"\n\nThe gutting of the public sector, deindustrialization and the wholesale elimination of jobs which pay a living wage, has had a disproportionate impact on black and brown communities. In many ways, the onerous assault on the (white) American middle class by the forces of Austerity and \"privatization\" was tested and pioneered on inner-city, working-class, black and brown communities.\n\nThe militarization of police departments, the excessive use of police force against innocent people, and the surveillance society was first applied to black and brown communities in America's central cities. These policies met with little complaint from white people who felt that they were being \"protected\" from \"black crime.\" Those forces are now being unleashed on the white middle-class to their surprise and shock.\n\nWhite supremacy involves, both in the present and historically, the systematic transfer of wealth, income, and other resources from non-whites to whites as a general group, and a white elite, in particular. There are many examples of this phenomenon.\n\nWhite Americans have at least 20 times the wealth of blacks and Latinos. The Homestead Act, the New Deal and the GI Bill, were all examples of wealth creation opportunities and an inter-generational transfer of resources within the white community that African Americans and other people of color were specifically denied access to. The extreme levels of wealth and income inequality in the United States is a story of how race and class work together to structure life outcomes."

      "text": "How White Am I?\n\nLast week I received two letters on the same day, one from a reader and one from the Republican National Committee, both presuming I was as white as white could be. But now I'm not so sure about my whiteness. \"Dear Mr. Levine,\" the RNC wrote, \"I don't want to believe you've abandoned the Republican Party. Have you given up?\" They seemed confident I belonged in their ranks as a member of the whitest club in America. \"In 2000,\" they boasted, \"we withstood the heaviest onslaught of liberal special interests� ever.\" Won't I help them keep up the good work, they asked. Feeling my melanin rising, I opened the next piece of mail, handwritten on a lovely little notepad depicting a covered bridge and signed only with an initial. It came in response to a recent story about school violence, penned in part by Tim Wise, an anti-racism activist. Wise pointed out, factually, that all the school shooters in recent years have been white kids. Just a day after this article appeared, 18-year-old white student Jason Hoffman wounded three kids in San Diego's Granite Hills High School. \"The recent article by Tim Wise,\" my correspondent wrote, \"stating that the school shooters are all white is in error. The most recent shooter, Jason Hoffman, despite his name appears to be some kind of spic\" -- sic. Normally, I ignore such mail, but this one got me thinking. This reader, like the GOP, had also assumed I was white and therefore sympathetic to his point. This put me in a dark mood. How white was I anyway? I was white for last year's census, even though nearly seven million Americans for the first time were able to check more than one racial box. But then last week some BBC documentary makers reconstructed the face of a 2000-year-old Israeli in order to show that Jesus, a first-century Middle Eastern Jew, looked like a first-century Middle Eastern Jew: a \"dark-skinned, curly-haired man with a round, robust face and a stout nose,\" as the filmmakers put it. Not exactly the usual portrayal of Jesus as The Ultimate Caucasian (blond locks, blue eyes, pale skin, patrician nose). He was now, the article implied, a lot less white than we thought. And, except for the desert tan, he now looked a lot more like me than he used to. I was beginning to feel like an off-white person -- certainly a semi-gloss. Then David Horowitz mixed my paint can completely. For the last month or two Horowitz has been trying to interest university newspapers in publishing his full-page ad, \"Ten Reasons Why Reparations for Blacks is a Bad Idea for Blacks -- and Racist Too.\" His message to white people about the legacy of slavery: It ain't your fault; blacks already got reparations (i.e., welfare); blacks are better off here than in other countries anyway; and God forbid America should insult black people by fulfilling 136-year-old promises. Many college papers ran the ads, and the inevitable protests ensued. Horowitz forgot to mention one simple fact in his anti-reparations screed. I offer it to him not because I think he deserves it but because he was an idiot not to think of it himself. If reparations are ever awarded to African-Americans, the cash will come from our tax dollars. Either tax-paying black citizens will, in part, be paying for their own reparations or there will be some mechanism for black Americans to opt out of paying themselves. Instead of hiding his wallet behind a lot of patriotic rhetoric, all David Horowitz needs to do to get out of paying reparations is to prove that he's just a little bit black. The \"white pride\" crowd will be happy to prove Horowitz isn't completely white if, as I presume, he's not a Christian. And being incompletely white has been one definition of \"black\" in America since way before even the beloved Civil War. So Horowitz may be saved. But what will the real racial separatists do? It's too late for them to check more than one box on the census. But Horowitz can come to the rescue of white supremacists here. He is a regular contributor to popular magazines, so he might consider devising one of those little tests -- \"How White Are You? Take this easy quiz!\" -- perfect for USA Today, fashion magazines and the \"kids' pages\" on the Klan website. Just fail one simple question and, bingo, even a White Aryan Resistance member has proof he's as good as black now. Of course, that may make these guys eligible for reparations themselves. But paying people to consider themselves black may be the most realistic solution to bigotry anyone has ever devised. In such a race- and money-obsessed country as ours, it's the only thing likely to work 100 percent of the time."

Like Trump, They Insist They Were Cheated\" - and this dek - \"The white majority is fading, the economy is changing and there's a pervasive sense of loss in districts where Republicans fought the outcome of the 2020 election.\"\n\nThe content of the piece is familiar. White people feel anxiety about changes to the American national character. Those changes are rooted in demographics, economics, religion and culture. But the details of the story, which I'm not bothering to recount, are not important compared to its broad contours, which are this: white people don't like change so they're voting for the Republicans.\n\nBut \"change\" and \"loss\" and \"the economy\" - as well as \"working class\" and \"middle American\" and \"non-college voter\" - are words in the Times ' value-free vernacular, that others replicate, that obscures who is doing what to whom . For that, we must turn to the pull quotes, as we journalists call them. Here they are in order of appearance:\n\nOne: \"In Fort Bend County, Texas, things are changing.\"\n\nTwo: \"Mosques and Hindu temples draw thousands, farmland is giving way to suburbs and some Republicans feel their county is becoming more like majority-minority Houston.\"\n\nThree: \"Once predominantly white, Fort Bend has quickly become one of the most diverse places in the country. Its congressman is an outspoken denier of Donald J. Trump's defeat.\"\n\nIf there is a way of saying that white people in Fort Bend County, Texas, are prepared to go to war with liberal democracy in order to protect the political advantages built into the politics of white power, these three quotes, in order of appearance, are the closest we'll get.\n\nThat is, unless an authoritative source of spells it out:\n\nBecause they are more vulnerable, disadvantaged or less educated, white voters can feel especially endangered by the trend toward a minority-majority, said Ashley Jardina, a political scientist at George Mason University who studies the attitudes of those voters.\n\n'A lot of white Americans who are really threatened are willing to reject democratic norms,' she said, 'because they see it as a way to protect their status.'\n\nActually, that's close but not close enough.\n\nThe face of liberal democracy's enemy is white.\n\nPerry Bacon doesn't go that far, but the Post 's columnist has come the closest, as far as I can tell, to naming names. Most Republicans are white, he wrote recently. White people dominate the electorate. Most white people, by way of supporting the GOP's assault on democracy, and are doing so without being held accountable by the press. Bacon:\n\nBecause white people are likely to be the majority of voters for at least two more decades, America is in trouble. Across the country, GOP officials are banning books from public libraries, making it harder for non-Republicans to vote, stripping away Black political power, aggressively gerrymandering, censoring teachers and professors and, most important, denying the results of legitimate elections. The majority of America's white voters are enabling and encouraging the GOP's radical, antidemocratic turn by continuing to back the party in elections.\n\nIt's not, as much of our political discourse implies, that the Democrats have a working-class or Middle America or non-college-voter problem. The more important story is that America has a white voter problem. And there is no sign it's going away anytime soon.\n\nAn apparent counterpoint is that white people are not afraid of losing the built-in advantages of white power so much as afraid of the rising costs of energy, groceries and so on. These are much-talked-about \"kitchen table\" issues that are always presented as if they have nothing to do with the political landscape that we all inhabit.\n\nEconomic issues are cited, by the far right and far left, as reason for Donald Trump's election and the rise of redhat fascism around the country. But when you look closer, even \"race-free\" concepts like inflation and \"being left behind\" are rooted in white power politics.\n\nKevin Seefried and his son Hunter were sentenced to two years in federal prison Monday for their role in Donald Trump's attempted paramilitary takeover, on January 6, 2021, of the US government. Kevin Seefried became a household name after a photo (above) circulated of him carrying a Confederate flag into the US Capitol.\n\nJeremi Suri recounts the moment in the introduction of his latest work of American history, Civil War by Other Means :\n\nLike many others in the mob, Seefried brought his son, Hunter, to the insurrection. It was a proud moment for a father who had spent many of his years in and out of work, living in an economically depressed area two hours from the Capitol. He and his son were taking back their country, showing that they could make a difference, standing up for fellow working-class families who felt forgotten. They would not accept a president elected by nonwhite voters. The Confederate flag was their battle flag.\n\nIt's here that we get to the real meat of the issue - the real reason white people are prepared to abandon liberal democracy in order to protect their precious privileges built into our political system.\n\nIt's not that they love their country. It's not that they love the Constitution. Their opposition to liberal democracy, and all that it costs them politically, does not rest on positive principle.\n\nIt rests on laziness.\n\nMost white people don't want to compete.\n\nThey don't want to compete for jobs, for resources or for political representation in a republican government of, by and for the people. They would rather use their already existing advantages to get out of working harder in the public square, the marketplace of ideas or a truly fair and level political economy. The Republicans are saying, in effect, vote for us. We'll save you the effort of competing with people who are putting twice the effort into participating in a democracy.\n\nThat's what truly frightened them after 2008.\n\n\"Sussex County, Delaware, where the Seefrieds resided in a rundown house, fit the pattern,\" Suri wrote in Civil War by Other Means .\n\nThis rural region of chicken farms entered a tailspin that triggered higher crime and drug dependence, lower incomes, and diminished expectations for the future. Everything seemed to be going the wrong way, and the election of the first African American president in 2008 only made things feel worse. Barack Obama symbolized an emerging country that the Seefrieds believed they could never enter. They lacked the education and pedigree to compete in a multiracial meritocracy that promised so much for some, leaving many others out. Obama's diverse supporters were winning, while the traditional white families in Sussex and other rural counties were not. The Seefrieds felt like losers (my italics).\n\nLiberal democracy's white-faced enemy is lazy.\n\nThat doesn't mean they will fail in the coming congressional elections. The white-faced enemy has many things on its side.\n\nEven the Times ."

      "text": "Why White People Freak Out When They're Called Out About Race\n\nStop me if you've heard this one.\n\nLast year, a white male Princeton undergraduate was asked by a classmate to \"check his privilege.\" Offended by this suggestion, he shot off a 1,300-word essay to the Tory , a right-wing campus newspaper . In it, he wrote about his grandfather who fled the Nazis to Siberia, his grandmother who survived a concentration camp in Germany, about the humble wicker basket business they started in America. He railed against his classmates for \"diminishing everything [he'd] accomplished, all the hard work [he'd] done.\"\n\nHis missive was reprinted by Time . He was interviewed by the New York Times and appeared on Fox News. He became a darling of white conservatives across the country.\n\nWhat he did not do, at any point, was consider whether being white and male might have given him-if not his ancestors-some advantage in achieving incredible success in America. He did not, in other words, check his privilege.\n\nTo Robin DiAngelo, professor of multicutural education at Westfield State University and author of What Does it Mean to Be White? Developing White Racial Literacy , Tal Fortgang's essay -indignant, defensive, beside-the-point, somehow both self-pitying and self-aggrandizing-followed a familiar script. As an anti-racist educator for more than two decades, DiAngelo has heard versions of it recited hundreds of times by white men and women in her workshops.\n\nShe's heard it so many times, in fact, that she came up with a term for it: \"white fragility,\" which she defined in a 2011 journal article as \"a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves. These moves include outward display of emotions such as anger, fear and guilt, and behaviors such as argumentation, silence and leaving the stress-inducing situation.\"\n\nWhen the Black Lives Matter movement marched in the streets, holding up traffic, disrupting commerce, and refusing to allow \"normal life\" to resume-insofar as normalcy means a system that permits police and vigilantes to murder black men and women with impunity-white people found themselves in tense conversations online, with friends and in the media about privilege, white supremacy and racism. You could say white fragility was at an all-time high.\n\nI spoke with DiAngelo about how to deal with all the fragile white people, and why it's worth doing so.\n\nSam Adler-Bell: How did you come to write about \"white fragility\"?\n\nRobin DiAngelo: To be honest, I wanted to take it on because it's a frustrating dynamic that I encounter a lot. I don't have a lot of patience for it. And I wanted to put a mirror to it.\n\nI do atypical work for a white person, which is that I lead primarily white audiences in discussions on race every day, in workshops all over the country. That has allowed me to observe very predictable patterns. And one of those patterns is this inability to tolerate any kind of challenge to our racial reality. We shut down or lash out or in whatever way possible block any reflection from taking place.\n\nOf course, it functions as means of resistance, but I think it's also useful to think about it as fragility, as inability to handle the stress of conversations about race and racism\n\nSometimes it's strategic, a very intentional push back and rebuttal. But a lot of the time, the person simply cannot function. They regress into an emotional state that prevents anybody from moving forward.\n\nSAB: Carla Murphy recently referenced \"white fragility\" in an article for Colorlines , and I've seen it referenced on Twitter and Facebook a lot lately. It seems like it's having a moment. Why do you think that is?\n\nRD: I think we get tired of certain terms. What I do used to be called \"diversity training,\" then \"cultural competency\" and now, \"anti-racism.\" These terms are really useful for periods of time, but then they get coopted, and people build all this baggage around them, and you have to come up with new terms or else people won't engage.\n\nAnd I think \"white privilege\" has reached that point. It rocked my world when I first really got it, when I came across Peggy McIntosh . It's a really powerful start for people. But unfortunately it's been played so much now that it turns people off.\n\nSAB: What causes white fragility to set in?\n\nRD: For white people, their identities rest on the idea of racism as about good or bad people, about moral or immoral singular acts, and if we're good, moral people we can't be racist - we don't engage in those acts. This is one of the most effective adaptations of racism over time-that we can think of racism as only something that individuals either are or are not \"doing.\"\n\nIn large part, white fragility-the defensiveness, the fear of conflict-is rooted in this good/bad binary. If you call someone out, they think to themselves, \"What you just said was that I am a bad person, and that is intolerable to me.\" It's a deep challenge to the core of our identity as good, moral people.\n\nThe good/bad binary is also what leads to the very unhelpful phenomenon of un-friending on Facebook.\n\nSAB: Right, because the instinct is to un-friend, to dissociate from those bad white people, so that I'm not implicated in their badness.\n\nRD: When I'm doing a workshop with white people, I'll often say, \"If we don't work with each other, if we give in to that pull to separate, who have we left to deal with the white person that we've given up on and won't address?\n\nSAB: A person of color.\n\nRD: Exactly. And white fragility also comes from a deep sense of entitlement. Think about it like this: from the time I opened my eyes, I have been told that as a white person, I am superior to people of color. There's never been a space in which I have not been receiving that message. From what hospital I was allowed to be born in, to how my mother was treated by the staff, to who owned the hospital, to who cleaned the rooms and took out the garbage. We are born into a racial hierarchy, and every interaction with media and culture confirms it-our sense that, at a fundamental level, we are superior.\n\nAnd, the thing is, it feels good. Even though it contradicts our most basic principles and values. So we know it, but we can never admit it. It creates this kind of dangerous internal stew that gets enacted externally in our interactions with people of color, and is crazy-making for people of color. We have set the world up to preserve that internal sense of superiority and also resist challenges to it. All while denying that anything is going on and insisting that race is meaningless to us.\n\nSAB: Something that amazes me is the sophistication of some white people's defensive maneuvers. I have a black friend who was accused of \"online harassment\" by a white friend after he called her out in a harsh way. What do you see going on there?\n\nRD: First of all, whites often confuse comfort with safety. We say we don't feel safe, when what we mean is that we don't feel comfortable . Secondly, no white person looks at a person of color through objective eyes. There's been a lot of research in this area. Cross-racially, we do not see with objective eyes. Now you add that he's a black man. It's not a fluke that she picked the word \"harassed.\" In doing that, she's reinforcing a really classic, racist paradigm: White women and black men. White women's frailty and black men's aggressiveness and danger.\n\nBut even if she is feeling that, which she very well may be, we should be suspicious of our feelings in these interactions. There's no such thing as pure feeling. You have a feeling because you've filtered the experience through a particular lens. The feeling is the outcome. It probably feels natural, but of course it's shaped by what you believe.\n\nSAB: There's also the issue of \"tone-policing\" here, right?\n\nRD: Yes. One of the things I try to work with white people on is letting go of our criteria about how people of color give us feedback. We have to build our stamina to just be humble and bear witness to the pain we've caused.\n\nIn my workshops, one of the things I like to ask white people is, \"What are the rules for how people of color should give us feedback about our racism? What are the rules, where did you get them, and whom do they serve?\" Usually those questions alone make the point.\n\nIt's like if you're standing on my head and I say, \"Get off my head,\" and you respond, \"Well, you need to tell me nicely.\" I'd be like, \"No. Fuck you. Get off my fucking head.\"\n\nIn the course of my work, I've had many people of color give me feedback in ways that might be perceived as intense or emotional or angry. And on one level, it's personal-I did do that thing that triggered the response, but at the same time it isn't only personal. I represent a lifetime of people that have hurt them in the same way that I just did.\n\nAnd, honestly, the fact that they are willing to show me demonstrates, on some level, that they trust me.\n\nSAB: What do you mean?\n\nRD: If people of color went around showing the pain they feel in every moment that they feel it, they could be killed. It is dangerous. They cannot always share their outrage about the injustice of racism. White people can't tolerate it. And we punish it severely-from job loss, to violence, to murder.\n\nFor them to take that risk and show us, that is a moment of trust. I say, bring it on, thank you.\n\nWhen I'm doing a workshop, I'll often ask the people of color in the room, somewhat facetiously, \"How often have you given white people feedback about our inevitable and often unconscious racist patterns and had that go well for you?\" And they laugh.\n\nBecause it just doesn't go well. And so one time I asked, \"What would your daily life be like if you could just simply give us feedback, have us receive it graciously, reflect on it and work to change the behavior? What would your life be like?\"\n\nAnd this one man of color looked at me and said, \"It would be revolutionary .\"\n\nSAB: I notice as we've been talking that you almost always use the word \"we\" when describing white people's tendencies. Can you tell me why you do that?\n\nRD: Well, for one, I'm white (and you're white). And even as committed as I am, I'm not outside of anything that I'm talking about here. If I went around saying white people this and white people that, it would be a distancing move. I don't want to reinforce the idea that there are some whites who are done, and others that still need work. There's no being finished.\n\nPlus, in my work, I'm usually addressing white audiences, and the \"we\" diminishes defensiveness somewhat. It makes them more comfortable. They see that I'm not just pointing fingers outward.\n\nSAB: Do you ever worry about re-centering whiteness?\n\nRD: Well, yes. I continually struggle with that reality. By standing up there as an authority on whiteness, I'm necessarily reinforcing my authority as a white person. It goes with the territory. For example, you're interviewing me now, on whiteness, and people of color have been saying these things for a very long time.\n\nOn the one hand, I know that in many ways, white people can hear me in a way that they can't hear people of color. They listen. So by god, I'm going to use my voice to challenge racism. The only alternative I can see is to not speak up and challenge racism. And that is not acceptable to me.\n\nIt's sort of a master's tools dilemma.\n\nSAB: Yes, and racism is something that everyone thinks they're an authority on.\n\nRD: That drives me crazy. I'll run into someone I haven't seen in 20 years in the grocery store, and they'll say, \"Hi! What've you been doing?\"\n\nAnd I say, \"I got my Ph.D.\"\n\nAnd they say, \"Oh wow, what in?\"\n\n\"Race relations and white racial identity.\"\n\nAnd they'll go \"Oh, well you know. People just need to-\"\n\nAs if they're going to give me the one-sentence answer to arguably the most challenging social dynamic of our time. Like, hey, why did I knock myself out for 20 years studying, researching, and challenging this within myself and others? I should have just come to you! And the answer is so simple! I've never heard that one before!\n\nImagine if I was an astronomer. Everybody has a basic understanding of the sky, but they would not debate an astronomer on astronomy. The arrogance of white people faced with questions of race is unbelievable."

      "text": "11 Ways White America Avoids Taking Responsibility for its Racism\n\nI am white. I write and teach about what it means to be white in a society that proclaims race meaningless, yet remains deeply divided by race. A fundamental but very challenging part of my work is moving white people from an individual understanding of racism-i.e. only some people are racist and those people are bad-to a structural understanding. A structural understanding recognizes racism as a default system that institutionalizes an unequal distribution of resources and power between white people and people of color. This system is historic, taken for granted, deeply embedded, and it works to the benefit of whites.\n\nif we are well-intended and do not consciously dislike people of color, we cannot be racist. This is why it is so common for white people to cite their friends and family members as evidence of their lack of racism. However, when you understand racism as a system of structured relations into which we are all socialized, you understand that intentions are irrelevant. And when you understand how socialization works, you understand that much of racial bias is unconscious. Negative messages about people of color circulate all around us. While having friends of color is better than not having them, it doesn't change the overall system or prevent racism from surfacing in our relationships. The societal default is white superiority and we are fed a steady diet of it 24/7. To not actively seek to interrupt racism is to internalize and accept it.\n\nAs part of my work I teach, lead and participate in affinity groups, facilitate workshops, and mentor other whites on recognizing and interrupting racism in our lives. As a facilitator, I am in a position to give white people feedback on how their unintentional racism is manifesting. This has allowed me to repeatedly observe several common patterns of response. The most common by far is outrage:\n\nHow dare you suggest that I could have said or done something racist!\n\nGiven the dominant conceptualization of racism as individual acts of cruelty, it follows that only terrible people who don't like people of color can commit it. While this conceptualization is misinformed, it functions beautifully to protect racism by making it impossible to engage in the necessary dialogue and self-reflection that can lead to change.\n\nOutrage is often followed by righteous indignation about the manner in which the feedback was given. I have discovered (as I am sure have countless people of color) that there is apparently an unspoken set of rules for how to give white people feedback on racism.\n\n***\n\nThe Rules of Engagement\n\nAfter years of working with my fellow whites, I have found that the only way to give feedback correctly is not to give it at all. Thus, the first rule is cardinal:\n\nIf you do, you break the cardinal rule:\n\n2. Proper tone is crucial - feedback must be given calmly . If there is any emotion in the feedback, the feedback is invalid and does not have to be considered.\n\n3. There must be trust between us. You must trust that I am in no way racist before you can give me feedback on my racism.\n\n4. Our relationship must be issue-free - If there are issues between us, you cannot give me feedback on racism.\n\n5. Feedback must be given immediately , otherwise it will be discounted because it was not given sooner.\n\n6. You must give feedback privately , regardless of whether the incident occurred in front of other people. To give feedback in front of anyone else-even those involved in the situation-is to commit a serious social transgression. The feedback is thus invalid.\n\n7. You must be as indirect as possible. To be direct is to be insensitive and will invalidate the feedback and require repair.\n\n8. As a white person I must feel completely safe during any discussion of race. Giving me any feedback on my racism will cause me to feel unsafe, so you will need to rebuild my trust by never giving me feedback again. Point of clarification: when I say \"safe\" what I really mean is \"comfortable.\"\n\n9. Giving me feedback on my racial privilege invalidates the form of oppression that I experience (i.e. classism, sexism, heterosexism). We will then need to focus on how you oppressed me.\n\n10. You must focus on my intentions, which cancel out the impact of my behavior.\n\n11. To suggest my behavior had a racist impact is to have misunderstood me. You will need to allow me to explain until you can acknowledge that it was your misunderstanding.\n\nThese rules are rooted in white fragility .\n\n***\n\nTheir contradictions are irrelevant; their function is to obscure racism and protect white dominance and they do so very effectively. Yet from an understanding of racism as a system of unequal institutional power, we need to ask ourselves where these rules come from and who they serve.\n\nMany of us actively working to interrupt racism continually hear complaints about the \"gotcha\" culture of white anti-racism. There is a stereotype that we are looking for every incident we can find so we can spring out, point our fingers, and shout, \"You're a racist!\" While certainly there are white people who arrogantly set themselves apart from other whites by acting in this way, in my experience over 20 years this is not the norm. It is far more common for sincere white people to agonize over when and how to give feedback to a fellow white person, given the ubiquitousness of white fragility. White fragility works to punish the person giving feedback and essentially bully them back into silence. It also maintains white solidarity-the tacit agreement that we will protect white privilege and not hold each other accountable for our racism. When the person giving the feedback is a person of color, the charge is \"playing the race card\" and the consequences of white fragility are much more penalizing.\n\nRacism is the norm rather than an aberration. Feedback is key to our ability to recognize and repair our inevitable and often unaware collusion.\n\nIn recognition of this, I follow these guidelines:\n\nThe above guidelines rest on the understanding that there is no face to save and the jig is up; I know that I have blind spots and unconscious investments in white superiority. My investments are reinforced every day in mainstream society. I did not set this system up but it does unfairly benefit me and I am responsible for interrupting it. I need to work hard to recognize it myself, but I can't do it alone. This understanding leads me to gratitude when others help me.\n\nIn my workshops, I often ask the people of color,\n\n\"How often have you given white people feedback on our unaware yet inevitable racism and had that go well for you?\"\n\nEye-rolling, head-shaking, and outright laughter follow, along with the general consensus of never. I then ask,\n\n\"What would it be like if you could simply give us feedback, have us graciously receive it, reflect, and work to change the behavior?\"\n\nRecently a man of color sighed and said,\n\n\"It would be revolutionary.\"\n\nI ask my fellow whites to consider the profundity of that response. Revolutionary that we would receive, reflect, and work to change the behavior. On the one hand, it points to how difficult and fragile we are. But on the other hand, how simple taking responsibility for our racism can be.\n\nWATCH: Two African American students explain the polarizing realities of being \"hypervisible - but also invisible\" in a nearly all white ivy league school, and what happened when they tried to educate fellow students on their daily lives.\n\nMelissa Harris Perry Show: 'Hyper-visible, but..."

      "text": "I Passed for White and Straight, Even Though I'm Not -- How Looks Hide My Identity\n\nI first became aware of my passing as a young child confronted with standardized testing. My second grade teacher had walked us through where to write our names in capital letters and what bubbles to fill in for our sex, our birth date and ethnicity. But in the days before \"biracial\" or \"multiracial\" or \"choose two or more of the following,\" I was confronted with rigid boxes of \"white\" or \"black\" - a space that my white father and black-Italian mother had navigated for some time.\n\nBut even at 8 years old, I knew I could mark \"white\" on the form without a teacher's assistant telling me to do the form over with my No. 2 pencil. I could sometimes be \"exotic\" on the playground to the grown-ups who watched us for skinned knees and bad words. But with hair that had yet to curl and a white-sounding last name, I was at first glance - and many after - a dark-haired white girl with a white father who collected her after school.\n\nThat girl came with me to junior high and even high school. Even as my hair became wiry with puberty, the frizziness soon a universal topic in the girls' bathroom as girls began their marriages to the straight iron, I became aware that I read no differently. Another curly-haired white girl who wished that her hair was straight.\n\nSchool records could be curiously inconsistent, occasionally marking me as \"white\" and sometimes \"other,\" my recorded ethnicity changing year to year as I would pass and then suddenly not.\n\nWhite parents of school friends would never fail to comment on how I was \"striking\" or \"foreign-looking.\" Distant relatives on the white side of my family would remark that I could easily pass for Israeli, for Spanish, for Italian, and other nationalities that can be filed under \"pan-ethnic.\" But they always equated me with the culturally sanctioned \"chic\" identities, like an exoticized princess you could encounter on a distant beach or in a novel. Compound that with my Hawaiian name (I was born there) and I was the problematic backdrop to any movie. The pretty prop to a white, male protagonist's discovery. Somebody's \"Pocahontas.\"\n\nThe first time I read Nella Larson's 1929 novel \"Passing,\" in which a black light-skinned protagonist is passing as white during the Harlem renaissance, the following passage eerily resonated with me: \"They always took her for an Italian, a Spaniard, a Mexican, or a gipsy. Never, when she was alone, had they even remotely seemed to suspect that she was a Negro.\"\n\nThis at times was even more perplexing to my white peers when they would encounter my mother, who although much darker than I, was still relatively light-skinned. But the disconnect became fully realized when I was asked by a friend in the seventhgrade why my mother \"talked like she was black.\"\n\nThat's when I learned that my mother was passing too.\n\nYears later, I had to be interviewed by a New York University Langone administrator before being admitted for surgery. The personal questions ranged from my address to an emergency contact to allergies. When he printed out the forms for me to sign, I noticed that he had marked my ethnicity as \"white\" - and without asking me.  I politely asked him to correct it.\n\n* * *\n\nAs an adult, I learned that my white doppelgÃ¤nger was also straight.\n\nI started dating women at age 17 - but with my conventionally feminine personal aesthetic, I once again had an identity that went unread. Even though I was out from a relatively young age, the high heels and dresses made acquaintances ask about \"boyfriends.\" Even as my female partners sat right next to me.\n\nWhen I got to college in the liberal Bay Area in California, the term \"partner\" offered a more veiled inquiry from strangers. But words I volunteered like \"girlfriend\" or the female pronoun still visibly cracked features, still framed a very visible pause.\n\nThese pauses have become even longer since I became engaged to a woman, as with deciding to have my relationship sanctioned by the institution of marriage have come the fairly predictable heterosexist assumptions.\n\nBut with every question about \"my soon-to-be husband\" and \"your fiancÃ©, what does he do?\" I see that my straight white doppelgÃ¤nger is present even in the most intimate and far away encounters. Recently on a trip to Italy, an American woman I had newly met asked how my fiancÃ©e proposed to me. As I began recounting the story, dotting my story with many \"she's,\" my acquaintance appeared confused and asked if my male fiancÃ©'s mother was in attendance.\n\nOnce, I told a new white male acquaintance where I used to live in Brooklyn, a neighborhood that now is completely gentrified, but wasn't when I started living there.\n\n\"What's that area like for a white girl?\" he asked.\n\nI nearly turned around to look for her.\n\nBecause with my invisibility has come her privilege, an experience that has undeniably marked most of my life.  Due to my passing, I have the W.E.B. Du Bois-patented \"double consciousness\" for the opportunities that have been placed before me, scholastic and professional, from generally white and hetero establishments that look at me and always see their own. Is it the presumed commonality that garnered me those interviews? Those smiles? Those callbacks? Those firm handshakes?\n\nWhen I read statistics about how employers are more likely to hire white people than people of color, I know that I can count myself in the former, despite the fact that I identify as the latter. I'm hyper-aware that when a bank, a company or any public office hears the sound of my voice and reads my legal first name (under which this article does not appear), they assume that they're talking to a white woman, and therefore give me better service.\n\nWhite and straight co-workers, employers and acquaintances don't outwardly shun me when they find out I'm of color or queer (due to the city I live in). There's no dilemma of being \"discovered\" (another privilege). But there's an embarrassment that crosses their face, a shuffle of papers, a reach for a pen - a social clumsiness in that they assume I'm not.  And there we both are, between a directly racist homophobic past and a more subtly racist and homophobic present.\n\nMy privilege in passing reflects a racism and heterosexism that continues to flourish, despite romantic notions that racial mixing and gay marriage will create a utopian future free of prejudices.\n\nPolice officers don't suspect me. Store owners like me. White strangers don't feel threatened by me. Racists get too comfortable with me. Homophobes unknowingly befriend me. My straight white doppelgÃ¤nger and I ride the subway together as I try to lose her in crowds and leave her behind at parties. I dispel her with the perpetual coming-out, the casual \"I'm not white,\" the introduction of my partner.\n\nI've spent most of my adult life actively trying to evade her. But every time I sit down with new people, I know that she sits down first."
