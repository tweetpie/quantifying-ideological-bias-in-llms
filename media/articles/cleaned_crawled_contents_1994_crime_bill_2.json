      "text": "The Federal Gov't Has Been Paying States to Imprison People: A New Law Could Change That Cruel Policy\n\nEven as President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions support a law-and-order authoritarianism that views mass incarceration as a good thing, Democrats in Congress are moving to blunt such tendencies. A bill introduced this week in the House is a prime example.\n\nOn Wednesday, Rep. Tony CÃ¡rdenas (D-CA) filed the Reverse Mass Incarceration Act of 2017 (HR 3845), which would use the power of the federal purse to reduce both crime and incarceration at the same time. Under the bill, states that decreased the number of prisoners by 7% over three years without a substantial increase in crime would be eligible for grants.\n\nThe grants would come from the Justice Department and would be awarded \"to implement evidence-based programs designed to reduce crime rates and incarcerations,\" according to the bill text.\n\nThe measure essentially reverses the 1994 crime bill, which set up Justice Department block grant programs aimed at increasing arrests and incarceration. Instead of incentivizing states to increase prison populations, the legislation would pay states to decrease them, while keeping down crime.\n\nUnder the legislation, grants would be awarded every three years. States are eligible to apply if the total number of people behind bars in the state decreased by 7 percent or more in three years, and there is no substantial increase in the overall crime rate within the state. The bill could lead to a 20 percent reduction in the national prison population over 10 years.\n\nAlthough state and federal prison populations have stabilized in the past decade and we are no longer seeing the massive increases in inmate numbers that began under Reagan and continued largely on autopilot through the Clinton and Bush years, the number of people incarcerated is still unconscionably high. With more than 1.5 million people in prison in 2015 , the United States remains the world leader in incarceration, in both per capita and absolute numbers.\n\nA healthy percentage of them are people locked up for drug offenses. The Bureau of Prisons reports that nearly half of all federal prisoners are drug offenders . Among the states, the percentage varies between about 15% and 25%; overall, about 17% of state prison inmates are drug offenders .\n\n\"The costs of our nation's epidemic of over-incarceration is not just metaphorical,\" said Rep. CÃ¡rdenas at a press conference rolling out the bill. \"Yes, mass incarceration and mandatory minimums have taken their toll on our families and our communities, and represent one of the biggest civil rights issues of our time. At the same time, the cost to the taxpayer is real. Americans spend almost $80 billion per year on our prison system, in addition to much more significant long-term societal costs. It's time to right the wrongs of the last decades and help states have the freedom to implement programs that are more cost-effective and keep our streets and communities safer.\"\n\nIt's not just in the House. In June, Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) filed the Senate version of the bill, SB 1458 . Both Booker and Blumenthal came out for the roll-out of the House version.\n\n\"In 1994, Congress passed the Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act, which created grant programs that incentivized states to incarcerate more people,\" said Sen. Booker. \"The Reverse Mass Incarceration Act would do the opposite - it would encourage states to reduce their prison populations and invest money in evidence-based practices proven to reduce crime and recidivism. Our bill recognizes the simple fact that locking more people up does little to make our streets safer. Instead, it costs us billions annually, tears families apart, and disproportionately drives poverty in minority communities.\" \"Our criminal justice system is in a state of crisis,\" said Sen. Blumenthal. \"Under current sentencing guidelines, millions of people-a disproportionate number of them people of color-have been handed harsh prison sentences, their lives irreparably altered, and our communities are no safer for it. In fact, in many cases, these draconian sentencing policies have had the opposite of their intended effect. State sentencing policies are the major drivers of skyrocketing incarceration rates, which is why we've introduced legislation to encourage change at the state level. We need to change federal incentives so that we reward states that are addressing this crisis and improving community safety, instead of funneling more federal dollars into a broken system.\"\n\nWhile the bills don't have any Republican sponsors or cosponsors, they are backed by a panoply of civil rights, human rights, faith-based, and social justice organizations that are pushing hard for Congress to address mass incarceration and the class and racial disparities that underlie it.\n\n\"At a time when we have an Attorney General who seeks to continue the unwise practice of privatizing prisons and putting more and more people in them, Congress must reform our criminal justice system and do more to address mass incarceration,\" said Vanita Gupta, former deputy attorney general for civil rights and currently CEO of the Leadership Conference on Human Rights.\n\n\"Rep. CÃ¡rdenas, and Senators Cory Booker and Richard Blumenthal, have developed a creative policy proposal that would serve as a powerful tool to accelerate state efforts in reversing the damaging impact of mass incarceration,\" said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League. \"This proposal builds on smart prison-reduction policies while also reducing crime. The National Urban League applauds the lawmakers and is committed to working with them until this bill is signed into law.\"\n\nThat could be a while. With Republicans in control of the Congress, the bills' prospects this session are clouded. But even among congressional Republicans, there are conservative criminal justice reformers willing to take a hard look at harsh policies of the past, and there is always the next Congress. While the Reverse Mass Incarceration Act of 2017 is unlikely to pass this year, it deserves to be fought for and is laying the groundwork for sentencing reform victories when the congressional climate is more favorable. Let's hope that's 2019.\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nView Non-AMP Version"

      "text": "15 Ways Bill Clinton's White House Failed America and the World\n\nBill Clinton remains one of America's most popular presidents. A national poll last March by NBC and the Wall Street Journal found 56 percent of Americans had a clearly favorable view of Clinton. That's long been true for African Americans-from novelist Toni Morrison famously calling him the \" first black president \" while in office, to books explaining his appeal after his presidency ended.\n\nClinton has used this popularity to build his enormously ambitious global foundation, collecting $2 billion in assets for many anti-poverty and health initiatives, as well as building a personal fortune from speechmaking estimated at $30 million or more. In recent years, most of the public has forgotten what Clinton did as president, even as he has steadily been in the news.\n\nBut for more than a year before Hillary Clinton launched her latest presidential campaign, Bill Clinton has been selectively telling media outlets that he made some mistakes as president and might have acted otherwise. He's even tried to recast actual events and been taken to task by fact-checkers who recall his leading role in what became major crises, such as the 2008 global financial implosion.\n\nWhat follows are 15 ways Bill Clinton's presidency did not serve America or the world, and in many ways deepened and perpetuated the problems we face today. This article was prepared by AlterNet staff members Janet Allon, Michael Arria, Jan Frel, Tana Ganeva, Kali Holloway, Zaid Jilani, Adam Johnson, Steven Rosenfeld, Phillip Smith, Terrell Jermaine Starr and Carrie Weissman.\n\n1. Prison-loving president. In May, on the heels of the unrest in Baltimore sparked by Freddie Gray's death in police custody, Clinton apologized for locking too many people up. Thanks, Bill.\n\nThe 2.4 million people in prison and the 160,000 Americans serving life in prison largely because of his policies might be excused for not accepting Clinton's apology. Tag-teaming with ex-President Ronald Reagan, Clinton is the president most responsible for the mass incarceration of Americans on an epic scale. The gung-ho crime fighter-in-chief passed the single most damaging law with his omnibus federal crime bill in 1994, which included the infamous \"three strikes\" law (three felony convictions means a life sentence) and ensured that mandatory minimum sentences imprisoned even low-level, non-violent offenders for a long, long time.\n\nClinton discussed his regrets about the crime bill with CNN's Christiane Amanpour. \"The problem is the way it was written and implemented is we cast too wide a net and we had too many people in prison,\" he said. \"And we wound up... putting so many people in prison that there wasn't enough money left to educate them, train them for new jobs and increase the chances when they came out so they could live productive lives.\"\n\nAll true, except it was not just lack of funds that eliminated education and rehabilitation programs in prison, it was a deliberate choice. Sensing the political popularity of being tough on crime, Clinton fully embraced the lock-'em-up-and-throw-away-the-key mentality, and gloated about three strikes. It strains credulity to think that this exceptionally intelligent man did not understand the dire consequences of what he was doing, as his wife now says.\n\nClinton's Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 helped set the national mood. Dozens of states followed with their own mandatory minimum laws. While there is some talk today of criminal justice reform on a minor level (like for low-level drug offenses), no one is talking about the all-but-forgotten population doing hard time thanks in large part to Clinton.\n\n2. Punitive w elfare reform. The consequences of Bill Clinton's welfare reform bill have been devastating for millions of American families. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 took a page directly from Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich's Contract with America . In an atmosphere steeped in decades of conservative scaremongering around the specter of sexually reckless \"welfare queens,\" Clinton's 1992 campaign promise to \"end welfare as we know it\" played directly to white voters' fears of black crime and poverty. Twenty years after scrapping the longstanding Aid to Families with Dependent Children in favor of the right wing's underfunded and more punitive vision, the number of poor American children has exploded and black welfare recipients are subject to the system's most stringent rules.\n\nIn 2012, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that while \"in 1996, for every 100 families with children living in poverty, TANF [Temporary Assistance for Needy Families] provided cash aid to 68 families,\" that number plunged to 27 out of every 100 families living in poverty by 2010. Conservatives trumpet these numbers, often citing the fact that nationally, TANF enrollment fell 58 percent between 1995-2010. But they neglect to mention that the number of poor families with children rose 17 percent in the same period.\n\nSociologist Joe Soss, who has examined the long-term racial consequences of welfare reform, which allowed states to decide how funds were allotted and eligibility determined, also noted that, \"all of the states with more African Americans on the welfare rolls chose tougher rules...[E]ven though the Civil Rights Act prevents the government from creating different programs for black and white recipients, when states choose according to this pattern, it ends up that large numbers of African Americans get concentrated in the states with the toughest rules, and large numbers of white recipients get concentrated in the states with the more lenient rules.\"\n\n3. Wall Street's Deregulator-in-Chief. As president, Clinton outdid the GOP when it came to unleashing Wall Street's worst instincts, by supporting and signing into law more financial deregulation legislation than any other president, according to the Columbia Journalism Review .\n\nHe didn't just push the Democrats controlling the House to pass a bill ( Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act ) that dissolved the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law , which barred investment banks from commercial banking activities. He deregulated the risky derivatives market (Commodity Futures Modernization Act), gutted state regulation of banks ( Riegle-Neal ) leading to a wave of banking mergers, and reappointed Alan Greenspan as Federal Reserve chair. In recent years, Clinton has ludicrously claimed that the GOP forced him to do this, which led in no small part to the global financial crisis of 2008 and the too-big-to-fail ethos, with the federal government obligated to bail out multinational banks while doing little for individual account holders.\n\n\"What happened?\" he told CNN in 2013. \"The American people gave the Congress to a group of very conservative Republicans. When they passed bills with veto-proof majority with a lot of Democrats voting for it, that I couldn't stop, all of a sudden we turn out to be maniacal deregulators. I mean, come on.\" As CJR put it, \"This is, to be kind, bullshit,\" reciting a list of Clinton deregulatory actions that began while Democrats were the majority, starting with appointing \"Robert Rubin and Larry Summers in the Treasury, which officially did in Glass-Steagall and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which left the derivatives market a laissez-faire Wild West.\"\n\nCJR concludes , \"The bottom line is: Bill Clinton was responsible for more damaging financial deregulation-and thus, for the [2008] financial crisis-than any other president.\"\n\n4. Gutted manufacturing via trade agreements . Bill Clinton helped gut America's manufacturing base by promoting and passing the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA , in 1993, when Democrats controlled Congress. That especially resonates today, when another Democratic president, Barack Obama, and Republicans in Congress, are allied against labor unions and liberal Democrats to pass its like-minded descendant, the Trans Pacific Partnership . \"NAFTA signaled that the Democratic Party-the \"progressive\" side of the U.S. two-party system-had accepted the reactionary economic ideology of Ronald Reagan,\" wrote Jeff Faux, on the Economic Policy Institute Working Economics Blog .\n\nIn 1979, then-candidate Reagan proposed a trade pact between the U.S., Canada and Mexico. But the Democrats who controlled the Congress would not approve it until Clinton pushed it in his first year in office. NAFTA has affected U.S. workers in four major ways, EPI said. It caused the permanent loss of 700,000 manufacturing jobs in industrial states such as California, Texas and Michigan. It gave corporate managers an excuse to cut wages and benefits, threatening otherwise to move to Mexico. Selling U.S. farm products in Mexico \"dislocated millions of Mexican workers and their families,\" which \"was a major cause in the dramatic increase in undocumented workers flowing into the U.S. labor market.\" And NAFTA became a \"template for rules of the emerging global economy, in which the benefits would flow to capital and the costs to labor.\"\n\nThe World Trade Organization, World Bank, International Monetary Fund all applied NAFTA's principles, which gave corporations the power to challenge local laws protecting health and safety if they cut into profits-like labeling tobacco packaging. The NAFTA \"doctrine of socialism for capital and free markets for labor\" could also be seen in the way the U.S. government \"organized the rescue of the world's banks and corporate investors and let workers fend for themselves\" in the Mexican peso crisis of 1994-'95, the Asian financial crash of 1997, and the global financial meltdown of 2008.\n\n5. No LGBT equality: Defense of Marriage Act. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was one of conservatives' biggest victories in the 1990s. Passed by Congress and signed into law by Clinton in 1996, the bill defined spouse as \"heterosexual\" and deprived legally wed same-sex couples of many significant benefits, from Social Security benefits to hospital visitation rights. It allowed states to refuse legal recognition of couples married in other states.\n\nWriting in the New Yorker , Clinton's former advisor on gay issues, Richard Socarides, addressed why he signed the wildly discriminatory legislation. For one thing, Socarides said that Clinton's political opponents outmaneuvered him. He also chalks up the president's decision as \"a failure to imagine how quickly gay rights would evolve.\" The former president was hardly an ardent supporter of the legislation. The New York Times noted , \"Mr. Clinton considered it a gay-baiting measure, but was unwilling to risk re-election by vetoing it.\"\n\nBut the damage was done. For almost a decade, same-sex couples suffered financial and emotional hardships. Gay couples weren't allowed to make medical decisions for their partners, couldn't get the major tax breaks afforded to heterosexual couples, and faced unequal treatment in many other areas of law. In 2013, Clinton stated his opposition to the law. That year, in a major gay rights victory, the Supreme Court declared DOMA's Section 3 (which defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman) unconstitutional. Today, 37 states have legalized same-sex marriage, and in coming days, the Supreme Court is expected to do so.\n\n6. Expanded the war on drugs. Although Clinton called for treatment instead of prison for drug offenders during his 1992 campaign, once in office he reverted to the same drug war strategies of his Republican predecessors. He rejected the U.S. Sentencing Commission's recommendation to eliminate the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences. He rejected lifting the federal ban on funding for needle exchange programs. He placed a permanent eligibility ban on food stamps for anyone convicted of a felony drug offense, even marijuana possession. And he prohibited felons from living in public housing.\n\nHe also championed the 1994 crime bill, a $30 billion effort that included more mandatory minimum sentences for crack cocaine, extra funds for states that severely punished convicts, limited judges' discretion in sentencing, and allocated billions for federal prison construction and expansion. During Clinton's tenure, federal prison spending jumped $19 billion (171%), while funding for public housing declined by $17 billion (61%). Under Clinton, nearly $1 billion in state spending shifted from education to prisons.\n\nThe U.S. prison population doubled from about 600,000 to about 1.2 million during the Clinton years, and the federal prison population swelled even more dramatically, driven almost entirely by drug war prosecutions. Yet a month before leaving office, Clinton said in a Rolling Stone interview that \"we really need a re-examination of our entire policy on imprisonment\" of drug users and that pot smoking \"should be decriminalized.\" If only he had acted on those sentiments when it mattered.\n\n7. Expanded the death penalty . When running for president in 1992, then-Arkansas Gov. Clinton allowed his state to execute Ricky Ray Rector, a convicted murderer with severe mental impairments. Despite much criticism, Clinton's decision not to commute the sentence not only established his tough-on-crime credentials as a national candidate, it also became a precedent to the expansion of the federal death penalty under his White House.\n\nClinton's 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty to 60 additional crimes including three that don't involve murder: espionage, treason and drug trafficking in large amounts. Throughout his presidency he ignored calls for a national moratorium on federal executions. In April 1996, Clinton followed up and signed the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) into law. Introduced by Kansas Republican Sen. Bob Dole in response to the Oklahoma City bombings in 1995, it severely restricted the ability of federal judges to grant relief in cases, reduced trials for convicted criminals and sped up the sentencing process.\n\nIn 2011, Troy Davis, an African American convicted of killing an off-duty cop, was put to death in Georgia. Davis' case sparked nationwide protests as many believed he was innocent. There was no evidence linking him to the crime and seven witnesses who helped put him on Death Row later recanted their testimony.\n\nMany believe Bill Clinton helped seal Davis' fate years before. Many of Davis' appeals were denied for procedural reasons and his 2004 petition, which included the recanted testimony and the possible identity of the killer, was rejected by the federal judge since, under current regulations, such evidence has to be presented first in state court. Davis' defense was unable to do that because, shortly before AEDPA became law, Congress slashed $20 million from post-conviction legal defense organizations. In a piece in Time , Brendan Lowe quoted Dale Baich, an assistant federal public defender in Arizona: \"The bottom line is that the AEDPA is very harsh and unforgiving.\"\n\n8. Returned to Cold War priorities. As the Soviet Union collapsed, the U.S. under President George H.W. Bush forged ahead with the same imperialist stance toward Europe. As Bush's successor, Clinton had an historic opportunity to attempt a cooperative, non-aggressive international model based on international law. While his administration frequently gave lip service to these ideals, a far-reaching economic and political agenda to bring Eastern Europe into the NATO-E.U.-U.S. orbit was in the works. As Clinton's former national security advisor Anthony Lake summarized, \"Throughout the cold war, we contained a global threat to market democracies: now we should seek to enlarge their reach.\" And enlarge they did.\n\nThe Clinton administration intervened massively across the former Soviet satellite states of Eastern Europe, with direct interventions in the Balkans through NATO, corporate buyouts of industry from Poland to the Czech Republic, and the notorious \"shock doctrine\" of neoliberal economic reforms in exchange for IMF loans: cutting wages and corporate taxes, increasing working hours and slashing social programs. Bringing the Baltic states and Eastern Bloc countries into military arrangements associated with NATO, and establishing a major military garrison in the Balkans, Bill Clinton set the stage for the clash on Russia's border in Ukraine currently overseen by Obama, which could last for decades and undermine the process of integrating Russia into the industrialized world.\n\n9. Joycelyn Elders and the culture war. At a 1994 U.N. Conference on AIDS, the U.S. Surgeon General, Joycelyn Elders, was asked if \"a more explicit discussion and promotion of masturbation\" could help limit the spread of the virus. Elders said she was \"a very strong advocate\" of teaching sex education in schools \"at a very early age.\" She added, \"As per your specific question in regard to masturbation, I think that it is something that is a part of human sexuality and it's a part of something that perhaps should be taught. But we've not even taught our children the very basics.\"\n\nLess than a month later, Elders was asked for her resignation. She had spent just 15 month serving as Surgeon General of the Public Health Service under the Clinton administration. As Arkansas governor, Clinton had appointed her director of the state's Health Department, the first African American to hold the title.\n\nElders later clarified that she'd suggested not to teach schoolchildren how to masturbate, but that masturbation is a natural part of human sexuality. \"People have taken a lot of things I've said in a most unusual way,\" she said. However, Clinton White House chief of staff Leon E. Panetta said her comment was, \"just one too many,\" and her remarks on masturbation were \"not what a surgeon general should say.\" Elders has also endorsed legalizing drugs and giving out birth control in high schools.\n\nThen-House Speaker Newt Gingrich said, \"It's good for the country and good for the president that she's departed.\" But as the New York Times reported, Elders' dismissal was met with heavy criticism from gay rights organizations, abortion rights groups and liberal organizations like People for the American Way. The New York City chapter of Planned Parenthood commented, \"Mr. Clinton will be making a serious political mistake if he continues to try to out-Newt Mr. Gingrich.\"\n\n10. Turning Lincoln Bedroom into fundraising condo . The Lincoln Bedroom is an historic bedroom on the second floor of the White House that was at one time Abraham Lincoln's personal office. Under Clinton, it served another purpose: an overnight apartment for top political donors. Between 1995 and 1996, donors who gave a total of $5.4 million to the Democratic National Committee-including businessman William Rollnick, who gave $235,000 to the DNC, and investor Dirk Ziff, who gave $411,000-stayed overnight as White House guests.\n\nClinton had few doubts about the idea. When originally pitched to him in a note by deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes, the president responded , \"Ready to start overnights right away.\" Sadly, Clinton started a trend . On the campaign trail, George W. Bush criticized Clinton for \"virtually renting out the Lincoln Bedroom to big campaign donors.\" Yet when Bush took office he continued the practice, handing the location over to donors who had given him over $100,000 and personal friends, including Texas oilman Joe O'Neill and Republican National Committee fundraiser Brad Freeman.\n\n11. Bombed Sudanese pharmaceutical plant. On Aug. 20, 1998 the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum North, Sudan was annihilated by a cruise missile strike launched by the Clinton administration. President Clinton claimed the plant was making a deadly nerve agent and maintained connections to Osama bin Laden, who was unknown to most Americans at the time. Sudan claimed it was a factory producing medicines that saved thousands.\n\nThe factory's owner, Salah Idris, denied the allegations vehemently and unsuccessfully tried to sue the U.S. government. According to a U.K. Guardian story, the plant \"provided 50 percent of Sudan's medicines\" and was the country's main source of anti-malaria drugs. Germany's ambassador to Sudan, Werner Daum, says the bombing led to \"several tens of thousands of deaths\" and Human Rights Watch wrote a letter to the president explaining how it had slowed down relief efforts in the region. In his book, Al-Qaeda: Casting a Shadow of Terror , Jason Burke credits the bombing with bolstering terrorism: \"[it] confirmed to [bin Laden and his cohorts], and others with similar views worldwide, that their conception of the world as a cosmic struggle between good and evil was the right one.\" Noam Chomsky has written that the bombing's consequences \"may be comparable\" to the attacks of September 11.\n\n12. Doubled down on Iraq sanctions . Due to President George W. Bush's disastrous war of choice in Iraq, people forget Bill Clinton's Iraq humanitarian disaster: U.S. sanctions that decimated the Iraqi economy, crippled the civilian infrastructure, and according to a 1999 UNICEF survey , ultimately led to the deaths of more than 500,000 children. Though the sanctions began under President George H.W. Bush in 1990, Clinton expanded them, insisting a week before he took office in 1993, \"There is no difference between my policy and the policy of the [Bush] administration\" and squashing any subsequent effort to rein them in.\n\nIn 1996, Clinton's Secretary of State Madeleine Albright continued to defend the sanctions. By 2000, some members of Congress cited an increasing number of reports of the humanitarian crisis, calling for an end to sanctions. House Democratic Whip David Bonior referred to it as \"infanticide masquerading as policy.\" But Clinton refused to budge, defending the policy until the end of his presidency in 2001. Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden cited the sanctions as one of his primary motives behind the 9/11 attacks on New York City and Washington, DC later that year.\n\n13. Political smears: Sistah Souljah. Clinton was highly regarded by African Americans during the 1992 election cycle for his ability to articulate how racism impacted their communities. However, when it mattered most, he dropped the ball on race when it was completely unnecessary. It started when he blasted hop-hop artist Sistah Souljah over her comments in a Washington Post article about the Los Angeles riots , which were sparked by the acquittal of several Los Angeles policemen who beat truck driver Rodney King. \"If black people kill black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people?\" she said.\n\nSouljah claims she was misquoted. However, a few weeks later, both she and Clinton spoke at Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition conference in Washington. Clinton used his appearance to criticize her statements , saying, \"We can't get anywhere in this country pointing the finger at one another across racial lines.\" He compared her remarks to former KKK wizard David Duke.\n\nAs Matt Bai wrote for Yahoo , Clinton was not going to lose black votes by calling the rapper out. Black people were (and still are) hyper loyal to the Democratic Party. But since Clinton is being reflective about his presidency, perhaps he needs to go back to 1992 and rethink why he used his time at the Rainbow Coalition to appeal to a segment of white voters who may have wanted to see him distance himself from Rev. Jackson, still a key leader in the Democratic Party at the time.\n\nIf you read the full Washington Post coverage and listen to some of Sistah Souljah's commentary on white supremacy, you'll see she makes some valuable points about anti-blackness and structural racism that are worth considering. But Clinton chose not to delve into that. Instead, he preferred to sell a sistah out and play the saxophone on the Arsenio Hall show.\n\n14. Knew about coming Rwandan g enocide. This might be Clinton's worst foreign policy failure. Intelligence analysts knew in advance about the plans for the Hutu-led genocide against Tutsis in Rwanda, yet the White House did nothing to try to stop it. In 2013, Clinton told MSNBS that he could have sent some 10,000 U.S. troops to the Central African nation to support a U.N. peacekeeping force and perhaps saved 300,000 lives-about a third of those who perished.\n\nIn retrospect, Clinton said, \"You can't stop everything bad that's happening.\" He pointed to his success ending sectarian violence in Northern Ireland, the Bosnian war and the 1993 Oslo Accord between Israel and the Palestinians. The fact remains that the White House knew one of the worst genocides since World War II was coming, and did not try to halt it.\n\n15. Escalated America's foreign drug wars. In Clinton's second term, he initiated Plan Colombia, a multibillion-dollar effort to reduce that country's coca and cocaine production and end a decades-long war between Bogota and leftist FARC rebels. While Colombian President Andres Pastrana Arango originally envisioned the initiative as an economic development, roughly 80% of U.S. aid under Plan Colombia was military assistance, making Colombia the third largest recipient of foreign aid after Israel and Egypt.\n\nPlan Colombia strengthened the Colombian military, which was allied with rightist paramilitary groups. It made gains against the drug trade and the FARC, but at a huge cost. Tens of thousands of civilians were killed and hundreds of thousands became internal refugees. Concern over human rights abuses in the Colombian security forces resulted in the passage of the Leahy Provision, which barred anti-drug aid to any military unit involved in human rights abuses.\n\nAnd then there was Mexico. Early this year when in Mexico, Clinton apologized for the U.S. role in the war on drugs and also for NAFTA, both of which led to violence. \"I wish you had no narco-trafficking, but it's not really your fault,\" he said. Clinton's policies were a double blow for Mexico. He deepened the drug war's efforts to reduce U.S. domestic drug use by interdicting flows from abroad, forever changing the nature of Mexico's contraband economy from small-time mom-and-pop operations to the immensely wealthy, powerful and violent cartels of today. Meanwhile, NAFTA opened the floodgates to illegal drugs hidden in the massive flows of legitimate commerce across the border. Large corporations weren't the only beneficiaries of free trade; so were Mexican drug traffickers."

As a longtime senator from Delaware, Biden has run twice before for the Democratic nomination. The last time was in 2008, when he ultimately became then-Senator Barack Obama's running mate. Biden's third bid for the presidency comes in a Democratic political climate that is notably more progressive than the last time he sought the nomination.\n\nBiden will face scrutiny for his long and checkered record in the coming weeks, including his 1994 crime bill that helped fuel mass incarceration with financial incentives to keep people behind bars. Biden has also long faced criticism for his handling of Anita Hill's sexual harassment allegations against Supreme Court justice nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991. At the time, Biden was the chair of the Senate Judiciary committee. Biden is also known for close ties to the financial industry, notably helping push through a 2005 bill that made it harder for consumers to declare bankruptcy. According to The New York Times , the credit card issuer MBNA was Biden's top donor from 1989 to 2010.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: One of Biden's key legislative achievements was the 2005 bankruptcy law that made it harder to reduce student debt, preventing most Americans from claiming bankruptcy protections for private student loans. He also voted to authorize the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. In the weeks before Biden announced his bid for the presidency, at least seven women stepped forward to accuse him of inappropriate touching.\n\nWell, last month, I spoke with Andrew Cockburn, Washington editor for Harper's magazine, about Biden's potential run for the presidency and his recent piece headlined \"No Joe!\" \"Joe Biden's disastrous legislative legacy\" was the subtitle. I began in Part 2 of this discussion by asking Andrew Cockburn about Biden's role in the 1994 crime bill.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That's Andrew Cockburn, Washington editor for Harper's magazine. To see Part 1 of our discussion, go to democracynow.org.\n\nWhen we come back, we look at a New York Times exposé detailing how Navy SEALs, who witnessed their platoon chief, Eddie Gallagher, commit war crimes in Iraq, were encouraged by their superiors not to speak out, and told they could lose their jobs for reporting him. Gallagher goes on trial for murder next month. We'll speak with New York Times journalist Dave Philipps. Stay with us."

The film, \"13th,\" is named for the constitutional amendment that abolished slavery with the exception of punishment for crime. The United States accounts for 5 percent of the world's population, but 25 percent of its prisoners. In 2014, more than 2 million people were incarcerated in the United States-of those, 40 percent were African-American men. According to the Sentencing Project, African-American males born today have a one-in-three chance of going to prison in their lifetimes if incarceration trends continue. We speak to Ava DuVernay. Her previous work includes the hit 2014 film \"Selma.\" With \"Selma,\" DuVernay became the first African-American female director to have a film nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards.\n\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I'm Amy Goodman, as we turn to a brilliant new documentary that chronicles how our justice system has been driven by racism from the days of slavery to today's era of mass incarceration. The film is directed by Ava DuVernay. It's called 13th, named for the constitutional amendment that abolished slavery with the exception of punishment for crime. On Friday, the film became the first documentary to ever open the almost six-decade-old New York Film Festival. This is the film's trailer.\n\nVAN JONES: One out of four human beings with their hands on bars, shackled, in the world, are locked up here in the land of the free.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Kalief Browder was walking home from a party when he was stopped by police.\n\nKALIEF BROWDER: Then they said, \"We're going to take you to the precinct, and most likely we're going to let you go home.\" But then, I never went home.\n\nKEVIN GANNON: The 13th Amendment to the Constitution makes it unconstitutional for someone to be held as a slave. There are exceptions, including criminals.\n\nJELANI COBB: The loophole was immediately exploited. What you got after that was a rapid transition to a mythology of black criminality.\n\nMICHELLE ALEXANDER: Animals, beasts, that needed to be controlled.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: You better believe it.\n\nJAMES KILGORE: It became virtually impossible for a politician to run and appear soft on crime.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON: The kinds of kids that are called superpredators.\n\nPRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN: Millions of dollars will be allocated for prison and jail facilities.\n\nPRESIDENT BILL CLINTON: Three strikes, and you are out.\n\nNEWT GINGRICH: There was an enormous burden on the black community, but it also violated a sense of core fairness.\n\nBRYAN STEVENSON: The states were required to keep these prisons filled, even if nobody was committing a crime.\n\nDANIEL WAGNER: It's so difficult to talk about mass incarceration, because it has become heavily monetized.\n\nMICHAEL HOUGH: The focus is on taking people from prison, putting them in community corrections, parole and probation.\n\nMICHELLE ALEXANDER: How much progress is it really if now there's a private company making money off the GPS monitor?\n\nSEN. CORY BOOKER: We now have more African Americans under criminal supervision than all the slaves back in 1850s.\n\nKEVIN GANNON: The other products of the history that our ancestors chose, products of that set of choices that we have to understand in order to escape from it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That was the trailer for Ava DuVernay's new film, 13th. It will be released by Netflix on Friday. The United States accounts for 5 percent of the world's population, but 25 percent of its prisoners. In 2014, more than 2 million people were incarcerated in the United States-of those, 40 percent were African-American men. According to the Sentencing Project, African-American males born today have a one-in-three chance of going to prison in their lifetimes if incarceration trends continue. Well, on Saturday, I had a chance to sit down with the acclaimed director Ava DuVernay after the Friday night premiere of her new documentary, 13th-again, the first time a documentary opened the New York Film Festival. DuVernay's previous work includes the hit 2014 film Selma, which told the story of the campaign led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and others to draw the nation's attention to the struggle for equal voting rights by marching from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, in March of 1965. With Selma, Ava DuVernay became the first African-American woman director to have a film nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. As we sat down together on Saturday, I began by asking Ava DuVernay about the significance of the film's title, 13th.\n\nAVA DUVERNAY: 13th is the jumping-off point for a conversation, a wide-ranging conversation, that gives you a tour through the history of racism, oppression and subjugation in this country of black people as it relates to the criminal justice system. 13th is speaking about the 13th Amendment, specifically the criminality clause, which states that slavery is abolished in this country, except if we decide that you're a criminal.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And what does that mean, from 1865, when the 13th Amendment was passed, to today?\n\nAVA DUVERNAY: Well, that's what 13th explores. We take you from 1865 and the abolition of slavery and the enactment of the 13th Amendment all the way to now and this Black Lives Matter movement. And we trace, decade by decade, generation by generation, politician by politician, president by president, each decision and how it has led to this moment. And we try to give, you know, gosh, some historical context to what is happening now. And I think people get in this present moment, and they start to forget that we're a part of a legacy. And this legacy is rich, but it's also very violent. And so, we try to kind of get into the deep layers in this film.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Let's go to a clip of 13th.\n\nKEVIN GANNON: The 13th Amendment to the Constitution makes it unconstitutional for someone to be held as a slave. In other words, it grants freedom to all Americans. There are exceptions, including criminals. There's a clause, a loophole. If you have that embedded in the structure, in this constitutional language, then it's there to be used as a tool for whichever purposes one wants to use it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That's a clip from 13th, Ava DuVernay's film. How did you go from Selma, the blockbuster feature film, to choosing to make this documentary, which opened the New York Film Festival-first time ever a documentary opened this film festival in over what? Half a century.\n\nAVA DUVERNAY: Yeah, yeah. You know, I-it's not the typical decision that you would make after Selma, but I don't have any precedent. There's no black woman I can ask about \"What's the right decision here, because you've done it before, in terms of being a black woman filmmaker?\" So, I'm kind of trying to create my own path there. A lot of beautiful black women filmmakers, but none that have been in the position where, unfortunately, they've had to kind of decide what to do next after a film that got as much attention as Selma. And so, for me, I thought there can't be a wrong decision. I'm not going to do what my white male counterparts might do; I'm going to do what feels right to me. And so, when Netflix said, \"Would you like to make a documentary about anything? We'll pay for it,\" I always knew that I wanted to explore this issue, and so it seemed like a perfect time.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I mean, the power of this film, and you go from president to president. I remember seeing you at Sundance, when you talked about-you talked about showing the film to the first African-American president in the White House, a hundred years after another president viewed a film there, and that film is in this film.\n\nAVA DUVERNAY: Right, D.W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation is a great, I don't know, jumping-off point to talk about the immersion that we, as Americans, have had with images that show black men, black people as criminals, because it really and truly started with that film, started with that film in a way that it was using the power of the cinematic image to subjugate, to turn the tide, to change opinion. You know, D.W. Griffith was a masterful filmmaker. He used a lot of techniques that we still use today. He innovated them, he invented them. Too bad he was a racist, because all of those tools that he was using was used to make people think that people like-other people think that people like me are less than they are.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And President Wilson's response?\n\nAVA DUVERNAY: That the film was history written in lightning.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That there was nothing more true.\n\nAVA DUVERNAY: That's right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: 1915.\n\nAVA DUVERNAY: That's right. AMY GOODMAN: So, let's talk about the presidential candidates of today. Your film does not start and end with these candidates, but it does refer to them. Talk about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.\n\nAVA DUVERNAY: Well, it's interesting that they-that the two candidates are in the film, but not really specifically about their candidacy. Oddly enough, both of these public figures have touched on this issue in their public life. And so we basically are illuminating that. Donald Trump and his comments and his call for the-for death of the Central Park Five, taking out an ad, really being on the forefront of that issue, fits into a section where we talk about media imagery and the insidious nature of the slanted media imagery, and then Mrs. Clinton, with comments that she made about superpredators, comments that she's made about reversing at her husband's legislation in the 1994 crime bill, her support of that at the time. So, they are embedded in the documentary in a historical context, not even speaking of them as candidates. We do have a section where we show Mr. Trump and some of his rallies, and we put imagery that I believe he is evoking against his words in the rallies. So, in one of the rallies, he talks about the good old days, when people were ripped from their seats and taken out in stretchers. And then we show you images of the \"good old days,\" when black people sitting at lunch counters, trying to desegregate, were ripped from their seats and taken out in stretchers. And so, they're both there. And hopefully people can interrogate the candidates more deeply than I think we as a-not your viewers, but most of the public is really giving us a-giving them a pass, because we're so embroiled in Twitter beefs and nonsense and not asking about the issues.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And this film, 13th, coming out in this pivotal election season, how do you hope it will affect the election?\n\nAVA DUVERNAY: I hope that people demand answers, demand some strategy, demand a plan. Neither one of them has really talked in great detail, or enough detail for me, as to what their feelings are about this issue in a way that is going to make long-term change. There's a lot of cosmetic talk, but I'm really interested in a full commitment to making change. And that can only happen if people demand it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And your, finally, focus on the many different people you interview, a centerpiece is Michelle Alexander.\n\nAVA DUVERNAY: Oh, yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Talk about her significance and Angela Davis's, in this last minute.\n\nAVA DUVERNAY: Well, you know, Queen Angela Davis, to be able to sit down with her, you know, one of the architects of the prison abolitionist movement, you know, one of the first people to really found the term \"prison-industrial complex,\" all her work in this space, long before it became the issue of this moment-and so, to sit down with her and have a wide-ranging conversation is elevating in every sense. And so she's a big part of the fabric of the documentary. Michelle Alexander, her work so foundational to a lot of our thinking about this now, and really trying to take a lot of what she educates and opens eyes to, and take it further in the documentary. And so she was gracious-not further in a negative way, but just to continue with that line of thought. And so she was gracious enough to sit down and give us a wonderful interview. I flew out to see her where she teaches, and it was-she's a big, big part, a big voice in this doc, as is Bryan Stevenson and Khalil Muhammad and Kevin Gannon and Malkia Cyril-a lot of really, really wonderful people who are just sharing their hearts in this. And hopefully, people will feel that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Ava, finally, what gives you hope?\n\nAVA DUVERNAY: Oh, gosh, the faces of black people, whenever I come-whenever I see them, because there's black joy amidst all of the black trauma. You know, all of the years of violence and oppression, subjugation, prejudice, all of the years of not being able to live fully free in this country as full citizens with all the rights and freedoms, it is-there's still joy there. There's a survival there that still allows for there to be a light, and that is such a strength, that is such a beauty, that whenever I see black people gathered, more than one, gives me hope.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That was Ava DuVernay, director of the new documentary, 13th. Again, it's the first documentary ever to open the New York Film Festival-to rave reviews and standing ovations. Let's turn to another clip of 13th.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED: The war on drugs had become part of our popular culture in television programs like Cops.\n\nKEN THOMPSON: When you cut on your local news at night, you see black men being paraded across the screen in handcuffs.\n\nMALKIA CYRIL: Black people, black men and black people, in general, are overrepresented in news as criminals. When I say \"overrepresented,\" that means they are shown as criminals more times than is accurate that they are actually criminals-right?-based on FBI statistics.\n\nBAZ DREISINGER: I mean, I'm a big believer in the power of media, full of these clichÃ©s that basically present mostly black and brown folks who seem like animals in cages, and then someone could turn off the TV thinking, \"It's a good thing for prisons, because otherwise those crazy people would be walking on my block.\"\n\nCORY GREENE: Creating a context where people are afraid. And when you make people afraid, you can always justify putting people in the garbage can.\n\nREPORTER 1: Chances are you could run into a kid waiting to relieve you of your purse or wallet.\n\nMALKIA CYRIL: Every media outlet in the country thinks I'm less than human. I began to hear the word \"superpredator\" as if that was my name.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED: Superpredator.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED: Predator. UNIDENTIFIED: Superpredator.\n\nBRYAN STEVENSON: \"Superpredators,\" end-quote. That's the word they use to describe this generation. And it was very, very effective.\n\nSEN. BOB DOLE: Experts call them superpredators.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON: They are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called superpredators-no conscience, no empathy.\n\nMICHELLE ALEXANDER: Animals, beasts, that needed to be controlled.\n\nMAYOR ED KOCH: When those grandmothers say, \"But he's a good boy. He never did anything,\" don't you believe it.\n\nDEBORAH PETERSON SMALL: Many black communities began to actually support policies that criminalize their own children.\n\nREPORTER 2: Last night, the eight teens accused in the attack were arraigned on charges of rape and attempted murder.\n\nMALKIA CYRIL: In the Central Park jogger case, they put five innocent teens in prison, because the public pressure to lock up these, quote-unquote, \"animals\" was so strong.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: You better believe that I hate the people that took this girl and raped her brutally. You better believe it.\n\nMALKIA CYRIL: Donald Trump wanted to give these kids the death penalty, and he took out a full-page ad to put the pressure on. These children, four of them under 18, all went to adult prison for six to 11 years, before DNA evidence proved they were all innocent.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That's another clip from Ava DuVernay's new documentary, 13th, which opened the New York Film Festival on Friday."

      "text": "After Hunter Biden pardon, activists ask president to 'extend same compassion' to cannabis prisoners\n\nDespite committing to tackling mass incarceration during his presidential campaign, President Joe Biden has rarely used the presidential pardon to commute sentences during his time in office. As his term draws to a close and amid outrage over the pardon of his son Hunter, advocates are pressuring Biden - who has pardoned thousands who had been convicted of federal drug charges but were not incarcerated at the time of their pardons - to grant clemency to thousands more who are still in prison over cannabis offenses. The president has a chance to atone for his past support of \"tough on crime\" measures, says the Last Prisoner Project's Jason Ortiz. He says Biden has an opportunity of \"correcting the injustices that were done over the past 20 or 30 years\" and should \"extend the same grace and compassion\" he showed his son Hunter \"to all the folks that he helped put in prison to begin with.\"\n\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, \"War, Peace and the Presidency.\" I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nPresident Biden is continuing to face criticism over his decision to issue a sweeping pardon to his son Hunter Biden. But the president's decision has also brought renewed attention to the power of the presidential pardon. Biden is now facing renewed pressure to commute the sentences of death row prisoners and to pardon or grant clemency to political prisoners like Indigenous leader Leonard Peltier, imprisoned in Florida, and the whistleblowers Edward Snowden and Julian Assange. The group Last Prisoner Project is calling on Biden to use his clemency power to free those still incarcerated in federal prison for cannabis crimes.\n\nWe're joined now by Jason Ortiz, director of Strategic Initiatives at the Last Prisoner Project.\n\nThis is very interesting, Jason. I think they say that Hunter Biden has been clean for something like just over five years. His father has openly talked about his son, formerly an addict. And as he faces bipartisan criticism, talk about what you think this is an opening for.\n\nJASON ORTIZ: Sure. So, this is definitely an opening for folks to talk about exactly how expansive we can use the pardon power of the president to make sure that we're correcting the injustices that were done over the past 20 or 30 years when it comes to cannabis crimes. President Biden himself was actually one of the architects of the 1994 crime bill that created a lot of the outrageous sentences that we're now dealing with today.\n\nAnd so, we're seeing that there are over 3,000 federal cannabis prisoners currently incarcerated on cannabis charges, and these are all folks that also have families and have parents and have loved ones. And we have examples, like folks like Jonathan Wall, who is somebody that was a Maryland resident. He was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for his first offense. And so, while I can understand why the president wants to have compassion for his own son, where we're really getting frustrated is that he's refusing to extend that compassion to all the parents that are currently watching their kids waste away in prison. Mitzi Wall, who works with the organization Freedom Grow, is the mother of Jonathan Wall. She was joining me this past week when we had the congressional press conference, when we were joined by folks like James Clyburn, Congressman James Clyburn, asking for freedom and clemency for folks like Jonathan Wall. And so, that's one example of 3,000 folks that are currently in prison.\n\nSome of the charges are far more egregious. Folks like Edwin Rubis was sentenced to 40 years in federal prison in the '90s. And so, he's someone that hasn't had a Christmas or holidays with his family. He has a son that's 27 years old. He has currently served 27 years of that federal sentence. He hasn't had a single Christmas with his son because of charges that were orchestrated and architected by President Biden, then as senator, in the crime bill. We have folks that are serving life sentences. Ismael Lira, for a trafficking charge, is currently sentenced on a life sentence for the same activity that is now legal across the country in 25 -\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Which is what?\n\nJASON ORTIZ: - different states, including - trafficking. And so, that would be the distribution of cannabis. And so, there is a specific differentiation between what President Biden's previous pardons were intended to do, which was only covering things like simple possession, where right now we have folks that are serving decades for trafficking, which is exactly what the hundreds of legal cannabis businesses across the country are currently doing on a regular basis, including right in Washington, D.C. And so, we're now seeing people sitting in prison for decades for the same activity that is currently generating tax revenue for cities and states across the country. We're paying for schools and building bridges with cannabis activity dollars, but still letting folks waste away in prison. And so, while I can definitely understand why a father would want to have compassion for his son and avoid prison time for his son, we're really asking him to extend that same compassion to all the folks that he helped put in prison to begin with.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: [Jason], you mentioned the previous pardons for simple cannabis possession, but that hasn't led to the release of many of those incarcerated individuals. Can you talk about that?\n\nJASON ORTIZ: Yeah, absolutely. So, those pardons were for simple possession, for folks that were currently charged on a federal possession charge. And, now, it is very rare for someone to actually serve prison time for a simple possession charge at the federal level. That generally happens to folks - somebody maybe got caught; they were smoking at a national park or some other sort of federal property where they were unaware of it. But there are nobody in prison for simple possession in the federal prison system whatsoever. So, despite his pardoning of 6,000 charges, zero people were released.\n\nHowever, the charges that we're looking to actually have folks released for, things like cultivation of cannabis, sales of cannabis, those are the charges that folks are currently in prison for. And we want him to expand his use of the pardon to cover all cannabis crimes that are now legal in the majority of the country.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, and, Jason, apologies, but, Jason, during your press conference last week, you spoke of, quote, \"the heartbreaking number of Latino fathers incarcerated for life or near-life sentences.\" How do these cases reflect systemic inequalities in federal sentencing?\n\nJASON ORTIZ: So, we've seen for the past 50 years or so that the war on drugs has been racially motivated, specifically targeting young Black and Brown men, and many of those are Latinos, here in the city of New York. There was millions of arrests across the country. We've seen countless young fathers that have been ripped from their families, simply because they were trying to make money to help feed their families.\n\nAnd so, I was somebody who was arrested in high school at the age of 16. I was lucky enough not to get incarcerated, but only because my parents were able to help me through this ridiculous legal process of keeping a 16-year-old out of prison.\n\nAnd so, we're seeing across the country that while these laws are changing, the retroactive relief and the restorative justice for the folks that were impacted has not followed suit with all of the cannabis profits that we're seeing developed across the country. And we know without a doubt that the war on drugs was and is still racially motivated, specifically targeting Blacks and Latinos. And so, we've yet to actually wrestle with that real racist history of the war on drugs. We're simply trying to just move on without addressing the past.\n\nAnd I think the president has an incredible opportunity now to really address the issues that have been developed over the last few years by taking real expansive action, using his clemency power to commute the sentences of the folks that are currently in prison. And roughly half of the folks that are on our list of constituents are Latino. And you can see very clearly just by looking down the list of names who is in there and who is getting out in the future. And Latinos are definitely overrepresented in the prison population generally, but especially in the federal system for cannabis crimes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, if you look at the clemency statistics by president, Biden is at almost the lowest, outside of George H.W. Bush. Biden, Trump , Obama, W., Clinton, H.W. and Reagan - he's number two, among the lowest. Are you speaking directly, are your groups speaking directly with the Biden clemency office? How far are these demands going? You're talking about thousands of people.\n\nJASON ORTIZ: Yeah. So, we have met with White House officials multiple times, and we've explained exactly the folks that we believe are the top candidates for clemency. And while they have been receptive, they have not told us that they're going to take any particular action to help these folks out at all.\n\nAnd so, what we are really doing is hoping that they will take action sooner rather than later. It is true that most of the time most presidents use their clemency powers at the very end of their presidency. However, President Biden has clearly shown that he's not going to wait for everyone to wait until the end of his presidency. He was willing to do it a little bit earlier for his son. And so, we're asking him to extend the same grace and compassion to all the folks that are currently incarcerated and release them immediately, let them join their families for the holidays, let them see their families grow up, and bring joy and happiness back into their lives.\n\nThese are folks that have served a tremendous amount of time already. This is not folks that we're saying did not commit the crime and should be, you know, released without any sort of punishment. Folks like Edwin Rubis have already served 27 years of their life in federal prison for a cannabis charge.\n\nAnd so, while he could wait, we are asking him not to wait, to do this immediately, to show the people that his presidency is going to be one where he will be remembered as addressing the issues that he created and coming to this from a place of compassion, and not continuing the process and continuing the damage done by punitive drug policies.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, Jason Ortiz, we thank you so much for being with us, director of strategic initiatives at the Last Prisoner Project."

      "text": "How a trend toward cost-cutting in prisons reveals the cruel impulse to profit from human misery\n\nby Rory Fleming\n\nT he general idea of US prison policy seems to be to make life as miserable as possible for people behind bars without violating bedrock constitutional principles from the 1700s. On first glance, recent moves toward technological \"updates\" -in the form of \"free\" tablets to enable incarcerated people to read-appear to buck that trend. But prison accountability specialists say we should take heed of how this move represents a mix of cost-cutting for prison agencies, profiteering on human misery, and a conspiracy to get prisoners to stop reading.\n\nThe West Virginia Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation (DRC) is the most recent prison to take the plunge, opting for prisoners to pay a nickel per minute to read e-books on the devices provided. Given that people make less than $1 an hour for their labor behind bars, it's a prohibitive cost for many. But the contract between GTL (Global Tel*Link Corporation) and the DCR makes sure to award the prison agency a 5 percent commission on fees.\n\nMichelle Dillon at the Human Rights Defense Center told Filter that the West Virginia DRC has pointed to the Inmate Benefit Fund to justify charging people for public domain books, echoing earlier claims that similar phone fees are not going back to the prisons themselves. Records show that the same fund is also being used to pay for the employment of people in prison, and for portable toilets, showerheads, microwaves, copiers, fans, religious meals, clocks, and even electricity.\n\nIn general terms, national momentum appears to be moving in a positive direction on prisoners working to empower themselves through education. Even the Trump administration supports bringing back Pell Grant eligibility for higher education loans to people in prison. (Pell Grants were taken away from prisoners as a result of the 1994 crime bill that presidential candidate Joe Biden has been slammed for supporting .)\n\nBut prison agencies at both the state and federal are well-known for thwarting even the most tepid criminal justice reform legislation -unless compliance is forced by law with no discretion afforded to them. The US judiciary, up to the Supreme Court level , generally gives prison chiefs carte blanche to abuse their wards at will. Financial and data-collection exploitation of prisoners and their loved ones is already common regarding e-visits and phone calls.\n\nShort of explicit legislation to guarantee free access, tablets-only rules will further exploit prisoners financially-and reduce access both to important educational materials and to the recreational reading that may mitigate the misery of life behind bars.\n\nBesides the profit motive, prisons have numerous incentives for adopting the tablet system. They are harder to get physically creative with than books, as Deputy Warden Troy Schultz of the North Dakota State Penitentiary noted in 2015: \"In the past we had cassette players and CD players. The motors from these were used to make tattoo guns. There's less material for staff to search through now.\"\n\nAdopting a tablets-only policy can also shield guards from embarrassment and bad press when they smuggle drugs into prisons. In Pennsylvania, Department of Corrections Secretary John Wetzel recently shut down paper book donation charities, citing alleged drug smuggling by friends and family of prisoners. An outcry later caused Wetzel, an alleged prison \"reformer\" who claims he wants more humane, Norweigan-style prisons, to reverse course . Shortly thereafter, it was exposed that his own employees had created the issue.\n\nRacism obviously factors into the denial of reading materials for incarcerated people. US prisoners are too often lorded over by racist guards (some in West Virginia were recently photographed giving a Nazi salute ). With a population that is roughly 3.6 percent Black , West Virginia has a wildly disproportionate 28 percent of Black prisoners.\n\nThere is a similar story in Pennsylvania, where 12 percent of the state population but 46 percent of prisoners are Black. Secretary Wetzel's entire reputation as a \"reformer\" and \"thought leader\" in prison policy hinges on his claims that he runs an \"evidence-based\" prison system. Having a research and statistics division led by someone with a doctorate permits Wetzel to evade questions about barely putting a dent in the number of people subject to solitary confinement from 2014 to 2017 , complaining that a prison closure would be bad for staff , and propagandizing that the installation of a few couches makes one of his prisons like a \"Little Scandinavia.\"\n\nSadly, Wetzel's data chief, Dr. Krisofer \"Bret\" Bucklen, has previously declared crime \"genetic.\" Screenshots of Dr. Bucklen's Twitter account from years ago show him laughing at jokes declaring Michelle Obama a transgender ape, as well as him boasting of his close friendship with blacklisted criminologist Brian Boutwell. Boutwell believes Black people have inherently lower IQs and a higher propensity for crime , including violent crime. In one of his shocking academic articles, Boutwell wrote that higher arrest and incarceration rates for Black boys and men were \"completely accounted for after including covariates for self-reported lifetime violence and IQ.\"\n\nIf someone like Bucklen wants to believe that imprisoned people are naturally unintelligent and less capable, keeping them from reading is excellent confirmation bias. But such a person should not be surprised when he or she is called a racist. Anti-literacy policy has long and appalling history in the US; laws in the 1800s forbade free people from teaching Black slaves how to read and write.\n\nWhat is happening today comes from comparable impulses. Prison officials in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and other states prioritize maintaining order at the cost of creating a maximally degraded prison population.\n\nThey do not want the self-actualization of more people like Reginald Dwayne Betts , who was imprisoned as a Black teenage boy and went on to become a Yale Law School-educated attorney and world-renowned poet . Neither do they even want it for white prisoners, like Shon Hopwood , a former bank robber-turned-Georgetown Law Professor . Betts' and Hopwood's individual manifestations of greatness despite soul-crushing conditions undermine a prison system organized around both control and failure of current and former prisoners.\n\nThere is no way any prisons chief in the country can deny this indictment without facing copious evidence against their position. They all know. Some might own up to it when asked, like when North Dakota Director of Corrections Leann Bertsch cried during a Norweigan prison tour and told a deputy, \"We're hurting people.\"\n\nCiting politics as an insurmountable obstacle to meaningful change, as Director Bertsch and Secretary Wetzel both did to Maurice Chammah at The Marshall Project , is cynical and lazy. While authorties cannot release people earlier for reading books, like Brazil's penal system does, they can at least aggressively push their legislatures on decarceration initiatives. They can cite cost as the reason, if they need to. They can make reading free for all and readjust budgets by laying off unnecessary employees.\n\nWe should demand that they do all of the above.\n\nThis article was originally published by Filter , a magazine covering drug use, drug policy and human rights.

      "text": "The Tragic End of the Woman Bill Clinton Exploited As Poster Child for Gutting Welfare\n\nWe are approaching the 20th anniversary of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act-also called \"welfare reform\"-which was passed by President Clinton working with the Republican-controlled Congress. This welfare reform law changed the terms of federal aid to the poor. Among other things, the law replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. The new TANF program placed a strict time limit on how long the federal government will provide assistance to individual poor families and added various work requirements for recipients. The goal was to \" end welfare as we know it ,\" which Clinton campaigned on in 1992.\n\nThe law was bitterly resisted by progressives, who argued it was effectively ending a safety net that had existed for poor families since the New Deal era. Several Clinton appointees actually quit the administration over welfare reform's passage.\n\nBut the outrage from the left not only failed to stop the passage of the law, it has proved incapable of changing the political culture enough to have the law reversed. In 2008, Sen. Hillary Clinton defended and strongly endorsed her husband's welfare reform while on the campaign trail. \"Welfare should have been a temporary waystation for people who needed immediate assistance,\" she said . \"It should not be considered an anti-poverty program. It simply did not work.\"\n\nBut for one woman, welfare reforms only made things worse. That woman was standing behind President Clinton when he signed the bill into law.\n\nLillie Harden\n\nIt was a hot August day in Washington when President Clinton signed into law his welfare overhaul. Behind him stood some of the politicians you'd expect, including Vice President Al Gore. [[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_original\",\"fid\":\"599689\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"height\":\"374\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\",\"width\":\"583\"}}]]\n\nBut who was that woman over his right shoulder? She was not a member of Congress or a cabinet secretary. She did not take part in drafting the bill. Her name was Lillie Harden, and she was asked by Clinton and Gore to come to the signing ceremony to say a few words.\n\nClinton met Harden, a 42-year-old mother from Little Rock, Arkansas, during a panel on welfare reform in that state more than a decade before the signing ceremony. She had spent two years getting AFDC benefits before finally getting work at a supermarket. Clinton reportedly asked her what she liked best about being off welfare. She answered, \"When my boy goes to school and they say what does your mama do for a living, he can give an answer.\"\n\nDuring her speech at the signing ceremony, Harden talked about how her children pushed her to get back to work and how she did job training in Arkansas to get off welfare and into work. \"When I got my job my son was so proud of me, but I made a deal with him, I told him, I'm going to work every day and take my work seriously.\"\n\nShe concluded her remarks by saying that Bill Clinton was \"the man who started my success and the beginning of my children's future.\" On C-SPAN footage, she was identified with the tag \"Former Welfare Recipient,\" which was, after all, her role in the ceremony, to prove to progressive critics that a former welfare mom could go on to be successful and raise children to be successful if only she got a low-wage job instead. Watch Harden's speech:\n\n\"I thank you so much for the power of your example, for your family's. And for all of America, thank you very much,\" Clinton told her after taking the stage. It was a spectacle the Democrats continued to use to defend their welfare reform plan. During the 1996 presidential debate with Senator Bob Dole (R-KS), Bill Clinton once again mentioned Harden's story :\n\nI still remember a woman that I met 10 years ago who said she wanted to get off welfare so her kids could tell-give an answer when they say, \"What does your mother do for a job?\" I met that woman again. She's got four kids. One's got a good job; one's studying to be a doctor; one's in technical school; one's an honor student in high school. I want to make more people like that woman, Lillie Harden. So I've got a plan to do it. And it's just beginning.\n\nBut as the 1996 election came and went, and welfare reform became law of the land, the political system lost interest in Harden. She was no longer in headlines, and didn't receive invitations to address the press corps in the White House. In 2005, journalist Jason DeParle wrote a book chronicling the struggles of several poor families. In American Dream: Three Women, Ten Kids and a Nation's Drive to End Welfare , DeParle followed up with Harden :\n\nIn talking about Lillie Harden, Bill Clinton had stressed how much her move from welfare to work would mean to her kids....Harden did have a straight-A daughter who went to college. But the son that Clinton was celebrating was better known for his rap sheet than his grades. Between the time Governor Clinton first told his story and the time President Clinton revived it, the teenage Carlton Harden had already served two years for shooting some students outside a North Little Rock high school. In the past decade, he has been arrested twenty times, for offenses ranging from disorderly conduct to possession of crack cocaine with intent to deliver; he's gone to drug charges twice.\n\n\"Oh boy, it almost killed me,\" Lillie Harden told me, speaking of her son's problems. \"He got out there and act like he don't have no brain.\" Harden had a stroke in 2002 and wanted me to ferry a message back to Clinton, asking if he could help her get on Medicaid. She had received it on welfare, but had been rejected now, and she couldn't afford her $450 monthly bill for prescription drugs. More sad than bitter, she said of her work: \"It didn't pay off in the end.\"\n\nAlterNet sought to interview Harden to see if her condition had improved, and learned that she died in March of last year, at the age of 59. She was living in North Little Rock, Arkansas at the time, a community where a fifth of the population lives below the poverty line .\n\nEliminating the safety net for Lillie Harden did not transform her family the way Clinton boasted. The pride she had in getting a job gave way to the harsh socioeconomic realities of her life.\n\nThe same was true for many others across the country-the loss of government aid did not instantaneously create living wage jobs with benefits, but rather sunk them further into poverty. This was perhaps most obvious during the Great Recession. One of the changes the welfare reform law made was to transform TANF into a block grant of money given to the states. That means that even as unemployment skyrocketed, \"because the block grant has never been increased or adjusted for inflation, states received 32 percent less in real (inflation-adjusted) dollars in 2014 than they did in 1997,\" according to a report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nIt's a stark illustration of how President Bill Clinton presided over one of the harshest systematic cuts to the poor of any president.\n\nThe Non-Apology Apology Tour\n\nThe story of Lillie Harden is one of countless that can be told about damaging legislation that passed under Democratic President Bill Clinton. These harmful legislative moves are likely to dog his wife Hillary, who has endorsed most of them in the past, on the campaign trail.\n\nLike her support for the war in Iraq, Clinton has sought to rhetorically distance herself from her past and that of her husband, without actually apologizing for her role in these debacles. Hillary first did her speech at Columbia University, where she said we need to \" end the era of mass incarceration, \" though she did not mention her earlier support for the 1994 crime bill that dramatically boosted prison populations.\n\nIn her speech this week on immigration, she advocated for a m ore lenient path than that of her husband , but did not explicitly apologize for anti-immigrant positions in the past, such as rejecting drivers licenses for undocum ented immigrants .\n\nOne item that has not appeared on the non-apology apology tour is welfare reform. It remains to be seen whether the tragic tale of Lillie Harden and others like her who were stripped of what little assistance the government provided will shift Clinton and the rest of the Democratic Party, rhetorically or in substance."

      "text": "The story of a horrendous injustice and the three people who tried to expose it begins with a suicide note\n\nTwo years into his 25-year sentence for attempted aggravated rape, Nathan Brown could tell the man sitting across from him - a jailhouse lawyer improbably named Lawyer Winfield - was not going to help him get out of prison. It was astounding to Brown that he was pinning his hopes on a fellow inmate who had an eighth grade education and whose formal legal training amounted to a prison paralegal course. \"But he knew more than I did,\" Brown said.\n\nBrown laid out for Winfield the details of his case. In the summer of 1997, a woman was assaulted in the courtyard of the apartment complex in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, where Brown was living with his mother. The woman, who was white, fended off the attacker with her high-heeled shoe until he fled on a bicycle. When sheriff's deputies arrived, a security guard suggested they question Brown - one of the few Black tenants in the complex.\n\nBrown, 23 at the time, was in his pajamas, rocking his baby daughter to sleep. The deputies put him in handcuffs and brought him to the victim. When she couldn't identify him, the officers allowed her to get close enough to smell him. She had told them her attacker had a foul body odor. Brown, she would later testify, smelled like soap; he must have showered immediately after, she speculated. In a trial that lasted one day, the jury found him guilty. After his appeal was rejected, he no longer had a right to an attorney provided by the state.\n\nWinfield began translating Brown's grievances into a legal petition. He argued that Brown's lawyer had provided ineffective counsel: He had overlooked the most basic defense strategies, failing to challenge the discrepancies in the victim's story and to insist on DNA testing. The two of them worked on the petition for months, so Brown was surprised when the Louisiana 5th Circuit Court of Appeal delivered a rejection just a week later. The denial - a single sentence that didn't address any of Brown's claims - bore the names of three judges. But something didn't feel right. How could they return the ruling so quickly? Why was it so vague?\n\nThe answer to those questions would come years later, in the suicide note of a high-level court employee who disclosed that the judges of the 5th Circuit had decided, in secret, to ignore the petitions of prisoners who could not afford an attorney. It was a shocking revelation. In a state where police and prosecutorial misconduct frequently make national headlines and a stream of exonerations has revealed a criminal justice system still functioning in the shadow of slavery and Jim Crow, a group of white judges had decided that the claims of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of inmates - most of them Black - were not worth taking the time to read.\n\nAmong those petitions was Brown's claim that a DNA test would have proven his innocence.\n\nOn a warm Monday morning in May 2007, as the secretaries and clerks began filing through the glass doors of the Louisiana 5th Circuit Court of Appeal, staff director Jerrold Peterson was inside his office with a 9 mm Beretta pistol. A letter he had written to the court's eight judges was making its way to the chambers of Chief Judge Edward Dufresne Jr. Versions of that letter were en route to the Judiciary Commission, the panel responsible for investigating allegations of judicial misconduct, and to the Times-Picayune, the state's most influential paper.\n\nPeterson hoped the letter would unleash a massive scandal - one that he had helped perpetuate for more than a decade. Fifty-five years old, Peterson had long been a fixture at the courthouse, and he reminded the judges that he had kept their secrets, clearing contempt charges against their friends and fixing traffic tickets whenever they asked. But he focused his rage on one secret in particular: their handling of appeals sent to the court by prisoners who claimed they'd been unjustly convicted.\n\nLouisiana requires that a panel of three judges review all such petitions - known as pro se petitions, a Latin phrase that means \"for oneself.\" But Peterson wrote that the judges had instructed him to ignore the law and dispose of the appeals on his own. Defresne, he explained, signed off on the documents \"without so much as a glance.\"\n\nThe implications were staggering. Over 12 years, the 5th Circuit, which is responsible for reviewing challenges from trial courts in four parishes, had disregarded at least 5,000 pro se petitions from Louisiana prisoners, according to the court's records. The inmates ranged from people convicted of murder to nonviolent offenders sent away for life. Many had limited education and struggled to present their arguments in the language of the courts. If Peterson's accusations were true, none of the judges had ever laid eyes on their claims.\n\nPeterson, who was known to keep his door open, didn't answer the business services manager when she came by to tell him that Dufresne wanted to see him. The chief judge instructed her to have the head of security unlock the door. As he slid in his passkey, the sound of a gunshot echoed through the building.\n\nA police detective arrived at the courthouse and found Peterson at his desk, slumped to one side, the Beretta still clutched in his right hand. The rest of the office, the detective wrote in his incident report, \"seemed to be void of any further evidence.\" When the officer searched the room a second time \"for a final attempt to locate a possible suicide note,\" Dufresne joined him. The chief judge didn't mention that he had already read Peterson's suicide letter. The detective, though, sensed something was amiss. In his report, he noted that Dufresne \"appeared to be evasive.\"\n\nThe 5th Circuit courthouse sits on the edge of downtown Gretna, a sleepy New Orleans suburb of 17,000 that serves as the government seat for Jefferson Parish. A tight bend in the Mississippi River separates Gretna from New Orleans, but politically and socially, the two are much further apart. Connecting the cities are twin bridges that became notorious after Hurricane Katrina when thousands of New Orleans residents tried to evacuate over the span but were forced back by a line of Gretna police officers. For many Black people in Louisiana, the moment encapsulated the hostility of the suburb, an area shaped by white families who had fled school desegregation half a century earlier.\n\nOn the Gretna side of the bridge, the road becomes the Harry Lee Expressway, named for a sheriff of the parish who was elected in 1979 and returned to office six times on a platform of aggressive policing. Lee once proudly announced that he had ordered his deputies to stop any \"young blacks\" they might find driving at night in a white neighborhood. \"There's a pretty good chance they're up to no good,\" he explained. During Lee's tenure, the voters of Jefferson Parish sent David Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, to the Louisiana House of Representatives for a term.\n\nDufresne's ancestors were among the area's early settlers. His father, a plantation owner known as Big Eddie, built a white-columned brick home at the edge of his sugarcane fields in the neighboring parish of St. Charles. Dufresne, known as \"Little Eddie,\" launched his first campaign - a successful run for clerk of court - while he was still in law school. After he won a seat on the court, a local publication called him \"the Thomas Jefferson of St. Charles government\" and asked, \"Can Eddie Dufresne, Jr. go cold turkey on politics now that he's a judge?\" The answer was no. By the time he was elected to the newly formed 5th Circuit Court in 1982, he had become a power broker like his father, weighing in on disputes and promoting politicians he favored. Each spring, he hosted a lavish crawfish boil on the riverfront that drew sheriffs, businesspeople, judges and public officials.\n\nLong before he became chief judge in 2001, Dufresne dominated the 5th Circuit. On most weekdays, he would arrive at the courthouse in the passenger seat of one of his Cadillacs, driven by his longtime secretary, who would pick him up at the plantation house. Yet he was perceived by many as a \"real salt-of-the-earth kind of guy,\" as one lawyer put it. He earned the loyalty of staff by keeping work hours short - he would often leave at 2 p.m. - and wages high. \"Dufresne ran a court for the benefit of the judges,\" another lawyer told me.\n\nDuring a monthly meeting of the 5th Circuit's judges in 1994, he proposed changing how the court handled criminal pro se petitions, also known as writs. The minutes note the proposal but only in passing; it's sandwiched between a lengthy debate over plans to upgrade the court's computer system and a discussion about renting a new office copier. Dufresne's plan is described in two sentences: A three-judge panel would no longer rule on the petitions unless they were \"special or unusual\"; instead, Dufresne would oversee them himself.\n\n\"Administratively, it got somewhat cumbersome to have to select three-judge panels for every writ, because you'd get hundreds of them,\" said Bryan Pedeaux, who was Dufresne's longtime law clerk. \"So Dufresne said, 'Let's see if we can somehow streamline the situation.'\"\n\nAt the time, the 5th Circuit had the lowest caseload - and the lowest number of pro se petitions - of the state's five appellate courts. In the year preceding the meeting, it reported 235 criminal pro se petitions, fewer than one-tenth of the statewide total. The 4th Circuit, which includes New Orleans, reported 1,031.\n\nDufresne's proposal was in keeping with his judicial views, former staff members told me. He believed that people convicted of crimes were almost certainly guilty and that any issue they raised on appeal was an attempt to avoid paying for their actions. He almost never reversed a decision of the lower criminal courts. \"There was a total prejudice against all people charged and convicted of crimes,\" said a former law clerk. \"They never planned to give any of these people any relief anyway, so what difference does it make?\"\n\nThe minutes give no hint of why the judges believed they could circumvent the state's law. Although Peterson attended the meeting, his future role in drafting rulings on the court's behalf is not mentioned. Still, it was clear Dufresne was offering to substantially reduce the judges' caseloads: At the time of that meeting, more than 75% of the court's post-conviction petitions came from prisoners without an attorney. The change went into effect immediately.\n\nProPublica made multiple attempts to contact each of the three 5th Circuit judges who presided during the relevant years and are still alive. ProPublica also asked for comment from the 5th Circuit courthouse. None responded.\n\nEntrusted with overseeing the new protocol, Peterson developed a system to dispense with the prisoners' applications speedily. He drew up 15 rulings for his assistant to cut and paste; they were typically no longer than one or two sentences and ambiguous enough to fit a wide range of claims. A couple of the rulings were labeled \"grants\" but did little more than allow prisoners access to their trial transcripts.\n\nSixty years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Gideon v. Wainwright that the Sixth Amendment guarantees all criminal defendants the right to an attorney. But in most states, including Louisiana, that right ends after an appeal of the initial conviction. Every subsequent appeal is part of the post-conviction process, an area of law that even experienced lawyers find challenging.\n\nJudges often view pro se appeals skeptically because they are filed by people who are not only untrained in the law but sometimes barely literate. Even liberal courts struggle with the high volume of petitions that lack merit. They are frequently assigned to clerks, who tend to recommend that judges dismiss them on technical grounds to avoid having to unravel what they see as frivolous or poorly made arguments. Still, the post-conviction process is essentially the only avenue prisoners have to introduce new evidence of their innocence or to persuade the court a defense attorney didn't do their job.\n\nThere is overwhelming evidence that state courts routinely send innocent men and women to prison. Researchers estimate that at least 1% of those serving time for violent offenses have been wrongfully convicted - roughly 7,000 inmates in state prisons alone - though they believe that number is much higher . Louisiana law says that people sentenced to death are entitled to court-appointed lawyers for all of their appeals. Subjected to such scrutiny, an astounding number of the state's prosecutions have fallen apart. Since 1976, 82% of Louisiana's death sentences have been overturned by appeals judges after defense attorneys exposed serious violations that occurred at trial. Most sentences were reduced to life; some prisoners were exonerated.\n\nThat statistic underscores a fundamental inequity. The people sentenced to lengthy or life sentences were arrested by the same police forces, prosecuted by the same district attorneys, represented by the same public defenders and convicted in the same courts as those on death row, but they are on their own. When they file a pro se petition asking Louisiana's appellate courts to reconsider their cases, they are at a significant disadvantage. Those petitioning the 5th Circuit after that meeting in 1994 had no chance at all.\n\nTo create the appearance of a proper review, former staffers said Dufresne formed a \"pro se committee,\" which included three judges who agreed to lend their names to Peterson's rulings. Whenever a judge on the committee retired, Dufresne appointed someone new. The nature of the pro se committee was an open secret at the courthouse. \"I knew what they were doing, and I knew it was unconstitutional,\" said one former clerk. \"Everyone knew about it.\"\n\nIn Louisiana, courts charge prisoners a fee for petitions - generally $50. Those costs are usually paid by parishes in which the defendants are convicted. By 1999, the 5th Circuit was charging $300. The money, paid by taxpayers, flowed into the 5th Circuit's discretionary fund. In a period when the state's criminal justice system was close to financial collapse, with some public defenders representing as many as 400 people at a time, records show that the 5th Circuit collected at least $1.7 million for the pro se petitions its judges did not read. Former 5th Circuit employees told me the judges spent the money on office furnishings, travel allowances - even for retired judges - and other perks the state didn't cover. When asked about the fund's expenditures, the 5th Circuit said it keeps financial records for only three years and could not provide an accounting.\n\nThe pro se petitions made up only a small part of Peterson's responsibilities. His primary task was to oversee the court's central staff, a group of lawyers who reviewed criminal petitions filed by attorneys and wrote recommendations for the judges. He also spearheaded the court's lobbying of the state legislature and oversaw the construction of the new court building. \"He loved that job more than anything in the world,\" a former colleague told me.\n\nAlthough Peterson often put in long days, he advised his staff to spend more time with their families. Those who knew him well said his devotion to his work seemed to rise and fall in proportion to what was occurring in his personal life, which was in a perpetual state of flux. Former colleagues said he was unhappy in his marriage and had several affairs with staff members. At times his home mail was delivered to the office, and some of his co-workers suspected he might sleep there on occasion. Putting his children through parochial school was a financial strain. One of his daughters had died in her teens, and a brother had killed himself. A devout Catholic, Peterson had a hard time reconciling his faith with his troubled marriage and bouts of depression.\n\nPeterson was born into a family of river pilots responsible for guiding ships through the lower Mississippi. It's one of the most lucrative jobs in the state, with pay frequently exceeding $700,000 a year. Peterson's grandfather, father and brother all held the job, and two of his sons now do. Peterson took a different path. After he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy, he attended law school at Tulane University and took a job at a firm in New Orleans. He joined the 5th Circuit at age 37; his time with the court was interrupted only by his military service - as a reserve Marine colonel, he served in both the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.\n\nAfter years of overseeing the scheme, Peterson sought out Karla Baker, who had worked at the court years earlier and with whom he had been romantically involved. Baker was much younger than Peterson, and their relationship had continued after she left the 5th Circuit and took a job as a defense attorney at a prominent New Orleans firm. Peterson told her he wanted someone else to know what the judges had asked him to do, and he gave her a copy of his list of denials and the minutes from the 1994 meeting. He asked her not to do anything unless she heard from him.\n\nOn Saturday, May 19, 2007, two days before his suicide, Peterson received a call from Dufresne, summoning him to the courthouse. When he arrived, Dufresne and two judges were waiting in the conference room, and it quickly became clear they were there to fire him. They had evidence that Peterson had tried to improperly sway a case - that he had directed his staff to write a memo advising the judges to rule in favor of a defendant. Peterson rarely, if ever, recommended relief, even in cases filed by attorneys. But this happened to be a case Baker was defending, and Peterson had intervened.\n\nSome law clerks had reported what they viewed as Peterson's misconduct to the judges. Dufresne wanted to let it go, but a new judge on the court insisted they launch an investigation, which also revealed that Peterson was having a relationship with one of his subordinates. It had become too much to ignore. After more than a decade of denying the appeals of defendants, he was being fired for trying to aid one.\n\nPeterson was blindsided. He had assumed he had a level of job security commensurate with the amount of dirty work he had done for the court. \"Jerry thought he was one of them,\" a former colleague told me. \"He thought he was unfireable because he knew all the court's secrets.\" Now, some of the same judges who had asked him to break the law were dismissing him for what struck him as comparatively small-scale misconduct.\n\nAfter the meeting, he sat down and began to write a letter to the judges. \"Not one criminal writ application filed by an inmate pro se has been reviewed by a judge on the court,\" he wrote. \"Who's integrity is really in question when you have conveniently ignored your duty to review pro se criminal writ applications so you can reduce your workload, present a false picture of the court's work, and charge large sums for work you haven't done?\"\n\nOn the morning of his suicide, Baker said, she received an email from Peterson.\" He said by the time he was finished it will be Gretnagate.\" But he underestimated the determination of the state's legal establishment to protect its own.\n\nThe Times-Picayune ran a short piece on the suicide a few days later. It described Peterson as a well-liked, reliable employee. A staff member told the paper that Peterson's problems were personal ones: \"As far as anyone knows it has nothing to do with anything here at the court.\" The article made no mention of the letter Peterson had sent to the paper.\n\nThe Judiciary Commission initiated an investigation into the 5th Circuit. A person familiar with the inquiry told me it focused on Dufresne, but it never became public and never had any consequences. Its findings were sealed and sent to a storage facility that was already filled with the records of other misconduct investigations that are not subject to the state's public records law.\n\nNone of the judges involved in the episode was disciplined. A few months after Peterson's suicide, the 5th Circuit quietly adopted a new policy for handling pro se petitions: A panel of three randomly selected judges would now review them, as Louisiana law required. No one, however, alerted the men and women whose petitions the court had improperly rejected and who were in prisons across the state.\n\nKarla Baker wanted no part of the mess Peterson had left behind. But she had loved him, despite their complicated relationship, and felt partly responsible for his unraveling. She knew that Peterson had gotten into trouble because he had tried to influence the judges in her case. Although she never asked for him to intervene, she said, she worried her own legal career could be in jeopardy.\n\nMore than 16 years after Peterson's suicide, Baker is still hesitant to talk about what happened, and unsure of how to cast herself in the story. Raised in Louisiana, she graduated from Loyola University New Orleans College of Law and began her career as a staff attorney for the state Supreme Court. When she joined the 5th Circuit as a law clerk in 2002, she was taken with Peterson's intelligence and kindness. He never spoke down to her, she said, despite her lack of experience. He seemed to know everything about the courthouse, and he was always willing to help. As they became closer, she came to see a dark side. He was deeply unhappy, haunted. \"He lived on the edge,\" Baker said, but felt powerless to change his own circumstances.\n\nPeterson could have taken his documents to the Innocence Project or another nonprofit dedicated to fighting the injustices of the Louisiana criminal justice system, but those were not his people. So, he had left it to Baker, who had never seen herself as an activist, to bring the scandal to light.\n\nBaker anguished about the matter for months. She was engaged to someone by then and was embarrassed about having had a relationship with a married man. She wanted to put the episode behind her. She said she decided to send an anonymous complaint to the Judiciary Commission, laying out some details of the 5th Circuit's pro se arrangement. She didn't know about Peterson's suicide letter or that he had sent the commission a copy. She waited for something to happen, but nothing did, even after she sent the commission a second letter, this time identifying herself as the one who sent the initial complaint.\n\nFinally, Baker took the documents that Peterson had given her and drove to the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. Roughly 130 miles north of New Orleans, the maximum-security prison sits on a former plantation that covered 18,000 acres and is named for the African country from which many of its enslaved people were taken. That year it housed some 5,200 inmates, most of whom were expected to die at the prison hospice.\n\nAngola was once considered the most violent prison in the United States. Brutal assaults and murders among the inmates were common, and the guards were known for sanctioning a system of inmate rape and sexual slavery. After decades of federal intervention and grudging reforms, the prison has largely shed that reputation. Vocational programs, recreational clubs and a Southern Baptist Bible college that has ordained hundreds of inmates have been credited with reducing the violence. Angola also established one of the best prison law libraries in the United States, a sanctuary of sorts where jailhouse lawyers help other prisoners challenge their convictions and sentences.\n\nAfter passing through security, Baker asked to see Ted Addison, a former client who could no longer afford her services but with whom she had kept in touch. Addison was halfway through a 20-year sentence for armed robbery. For years he had been petitioning the courts on his own, insisting he had been unfairly convicted.\n\nBaker handed Addison a sheaf of documents, which included the list of canned denials Peterson had developed and the minutes to the 1994 meeting. Addison was stunned. Like many other prisoners, he had spent years trying to get the 5th Circuit to grant him a new hearing. He had filed six pro se petitions, and each had come back almost immediately with a brief rejection.\n\nAddison took the documents to the prison law library. Here, amid the rows of concrete cubicles, they were both a revelation and a confirmation of what the jailhouse lawyers had long suspected. For years inmates had noticed an unusual pattern in denials coming from the 5th Circuit: They would arrive just days after the petitions were filed, a process that usually took months at the state's other appellate courts, and the perfunctory language never varied, with only the names and dates changing from case to case. Now it all made sense.\n\nThe jailhouse lawyers set about alerting the prisoners who had petitioned the 5th Circuit during the relevant years. They believed Peterson's accusations could revive their cases. Addison felt they were organizing \"a movement.\" He sent copies of Peterson's documents to inmate lawyers at the state's other prisons and introduced Baker to Kerry Myers, editor of Angola's award-winning prison magazine, The Angolite. Myers had been convicted of killing his wife in 1984 and was serving a life sentence for second-degree murder. He had filed five unsuccessful pro se petitions with the 5th Circuit. \"I actually had a lot of hope,\" Myers told me. \"I said, 'This thing is going to blow up.'\"\n\nWith Baker representing them, Addison and Myers filed a joint petition to the Louisiana Supreme Court, demanding an investigation into Peterson's allegations and new hearings for all of the prisoners whose appeals had been ignored. Within three months, the court received 299 petitions from men and women across the Louisiana prison system, most of them drafted from a form that Baker had provided.\n\nBaker also prodded the Times-Picayune to cover the story. The newspaper's first article, which focused on the prisoners petitioning the state Supreme Court, quoted the suicide note Peterson had sent the paper more than a year earlier. Baker, who hadn't known about the letter, filed a public records request to obtain a copy from the Gretna police. The Angolite ran a story as well, calling the 5th Circuit's pro se system a \"simple and lucrative process for disposing of the dispossessed.\"\n\nThe independent review the inmates were asking for presented a threat to the 5th Circuit. If it showed that judgments were unjust, the appeals court could be exposed to civil lawsuits. If the reviews revealed a wrongful conviction, Dufresne and the other judges could face serious discipline, especially since the state's laws against judicial misconduct take into account the harm the injustice has caused.\n\nThe probability that at least some of the 299 petitions had merit was high. More than 90% of the prisoners came from Jefferson Parish, where prosecutors were known for striking Black men and women from jury pools in felony trials at a rate more than three times as often as their white counterparts . Because the state had long allowed \"split jury\" convictions requiring only 10 of the 12 jurors to agree, many of the Black defendants whose petitions Peterson rejected were convicted by what amounted to an all-white jury.\n\nThe Jefferson Parish district attorney had also made aggressive use of the state's \"Habitual Offender\" law , which can turn a two-year sentence into life without parole; almost all of the cases involved Black defendants. Many of the prisoners asking for a review had been sentenced under the law and were serving life sentences for nonviolent offenses like drug possession and \"purse snatching.\"\n\nSome of the judges who had sent these men and women to prison had gained notoriety a few years before Peterson's suicide, when an FBI corruption sting revealed they had accepted cash bribes and campaign contributions in exchange for allowing a bail bonds company to dictate the amounts defendants were required to post. The scandal sent two judges to prison and unseated a third.\n\nMore than 85% of defendants in the state are considered indigent, meaning they qualify for a public defender when they are prosecuted. Louisiana's public defender system is widely considered one of the worst in the country. It relies primarily on traffic fines and court fees - an unpredictable source of revenue that has never come close to meeting the need. Offices across the state struggle with caseloads so large that they have no choice but to put defendants on long waitlists, leaving them in jail until an attorney becomes available. Some attorneys have so little time to prepare, they meet their clients for the first time on the day of trial.\n\nThe Louisiana Supreme Court did not grant the 299 petitioners an independent review of Peterson's rulings. Instead, it adopted a plan proposed by Dufresne and the other 5th Circuit judges: Rather than saddle another court, the 5th Circuit offered to reconsider the cases itself. \"We are guided in this request by a desire to avoid imposing financial or other burdens on other judges in this state,\" the 5th Circuit judges wrote. In October 2008, the Louisiana Supreme Court remanded the 299 petitions to the 5th Circuit. (It did the same with another 155 that came later.) As part of the agreement, the 5th Circuit judges whose names had appeared on the Peterson rulings would not be involved in the \"reconsideration\" of the cases. New three-judge panels would decide whether the rulings, which their colleagues had never read, were nonetheless fair.\n\nWith new documents Baker had obtained through public records requests, including Peterson's suicide letter and the Gretna police report raising questions about Dufresne's behavior, Addison and Myers challenged the Supreme Court's decision. The documents, they wrote, \"show that all of the judges of the Fifth Circuit ... have an apparent or actual conflict of interest in this matter.\"\n\nThe Louisiana Supreme Court saw it otherwise, stating that it would not be appropriate to task the other appellate courts with the additional work or to spend $200,000 of the public's money to pay for retired judges to review the cases. Justice Catherine \"Kitty\" Kimball wrote that the court could not base its decision on the allegations of a depressed court clerk and an \"unsubstantiated\" police report about his suicide. \"While this may be the fodder of news reports and movies,\" she wrote, \"it is not, in my view, proper evidence for judicial action.\"\n\nWhile the Judiciary Commission inquiry was going nowhere, the state bar launched its own misconduct investigation - into Baker. The 5th Circuit judges had alerted the Louisiana Attorney Disciplinary Board that Peterson had intervened on her behalf. The following year, she left the defense firm and went into practice for herself, representing drug offenders and pursuing damages in personal injury cases. The bar association kept the case against Baker open for almost a decade before sending her a letter saying it found no evidence of wrongdoing and was dropping the investigation.\n\nIt took the 5th Circuit three years to review the pro se petitions of 454 prisoners. The Times-Picayune and other local news outlets had by then dropped the story, so no one was paying attention when the judges found that, aside from a dozen procedural mistakes, Peterson's cut-and-paste denials had been correct. In one case after another, they wrote, \"there was no error in the prior rulings of this court.\" The court had investigated itself and found it had done nothing wrong.\n\nMyers' life sentence was commuted in 2013. Addison served out the remainder of his sentence and was released in 2016.\n\nAs for the 5th Circuit judges, they prospered in the years after Peterson's suicide. Some were picked to serve on the state Supreme Court; others enjoyed successful political careers. Dufresne remained the court's chief judge until he collapsed in the office of one of his businesses on December 7, 2010. His obituary in the Times-Picayune didn't mention the pro se scheme. In St. Charles Parish, there's a Judge Edward Dufresne Parkway, a Dufresne Loop and an Edward Dufresne Community Center, where a life-size bronze statue stands. He is wearing a suit with a lobster pin on his lapel and one of Lady Justice on his tie.\n\nThat might have been the end of the story but for an unusual confluence of events that landed a former federal law clerk with an extraordinary resumé in a prison bunk bed next to the last inmate still fighting the 5th Circuit's sham denials.\n\nOn January 2, 2019, Haller Jackson IV walked into Angola to serve out the remainder of a sentence for soliciting sex from a minor. He was 37 years old, 6-foot-4 and weighed 200 pounds, but he carried himself like a man who was doing his best to appear smaller. His right eye was blood red, a reminder of a beating he'd received a few weeks earlier at another prison.\n\nJackson had begun his sentence in Angola four years earlier. When his legal advocacy on behalf of fellow inmates called attention to, among other things, the prison's inadequate health care, he was transferred to Dixon Correctional Institute, some 35 miles away. After he was assaulted, Jackson said, his lawyer secured his return to Angola, as long as he promised to refrain from embarrassing the authorities.\n\nJackson was relieved to be able to resume his work as an inmate lawyer. He had a year and a half left on his sentence, and he wanted to make the most of it. As a registered sex offender, he likely would never be allowed to practice law. While he settled in that first day, a man in the adjacent bunk bed introduced himself. His name was Louie M. Schexnayder Jr., but in Angola everybody called him Schex.\n\nSchexnayder was convicted of murder in 1995. He'd petitioned the 5th Circuit 11 times during the period of Peterson's blanket denials, raising questions about the competency of his defense attorney and the testimony of a witness who later recanted. After the judges at the 5th Circuit affirmed Peterson's rulings, Schexnayder hired a lawyer to help him petition the federal courts.\n\nStanding in Schexnayder's way - and in the way of all the 5th Circuit petitioners who tried to take their cases to federal court - was the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, a federal law signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996, at the height of his efforts to portray himself as a tough-on-crime Democrat. The law, known by its unwieldy initials as AEDPA, has made it all but impossible for federal judges to overturn criminal rulings by state courts.\n\nAEDPA was supposed to help deter domestic terrorism and expedite delays in carrying out capital punishment, but it did neither. The time between sentencing and execution is almost twice as long today as it was 27 years ago, and by most measures domestic terrorism has increased. But the law has significantly undermined habeas corpus, the constitutional safeguard that gives prisoners the right to challenge their incarceration.\n\nOne of the act's toughest restrictions, and the one keeping the Louisiana prisoners from taking their cases to federal court, requires federal judges to defer to state court rulings in all but the narrowest of circumstances. Federal judges can't step in just because a state court proceeding or ruling violated a prisoner's rights. They can reverse the state ruling only if it was so wrong that not a single \"reasonable jurist\" would agree with it. Before AEDPA, federal judges provided a critical safeguard. Unlike state judges, most of whom face reelection and can be loath to reverse convictions for fear of appearing \"soft on crime,\" they are appointed for life and are theoretically free from political pressure.\n\nSince AEDPA was enacted, state convictions based on the fabricated testimony of jailhouse informants or obtained by prosecutors suppressing or falsifying evidence are routinely upheld. Even in cases in which trial judges adopted the prosecution's brief as their ruling, typos and all , federal judges have declined to step in. Those who do have been repeatedly slapped down by the Supreme Court in opinions that further narrowed the grounds for federal review. If the better-known 1994 crime bill was intended to lock more people up, AEDPA effectively threw away the key.\n\nWhile some federal judges have tried to push back against AEDPA's restrictions, those in Louisiana have applied them with zeal. In case after case, Louisiana's federal courts have signaled to state court judges that virtually no violation of a prisoner's constitutional rights is so egregious as to warrant review. Dufresne's pro se scheme was no exception. When Schexnayder asked a federal district court for a new hearing in light of Peterson's revelations, the judge cited AEDPA in denying his request, and the federal appellate court affirmed. But on that day in January 2019, when Jackson climbed into the top bunk in the prison dormitory he shared with 85 other men, Schexnayder thought finally he might get the help he needed.\n\nAngola has produced some formidable jailhouse lawyers, but Jackson was unlike any of them. The son of a prominent family in Shreveport, he had studied law at Tulane, graduating first in his class with the highest grade-point average in the school's history. While also pursuing a doctorate in epidemiology, he served as editor-in-chief of the law review and shattered the school's record for the number of awards and honors earned by an individual student. The lives of most Angola prisoners were marked by extreme poverty; Jackson had grown up in extraordinary privilege. If he hadn't been gay, he believes he might have been a frat boy, practicing at the family law firm and going to the Shreveport Club for dinner, just as generations of Haller Jacksons before him had done. Instead, he distanced himself from that lineage. After graduating from law school, he landed several prestigious federal clerkships and focused his efforts on prisoner rights and habeas cases.\n\nBut it all came crashing down in 2014, when he was arrested in New Orleans after arranging online with an undercover agent to pay for sex with a 10-year-old boy. By his own account, he had become addicted to alcohol and dependent on methamphetamines. It was a spectacular downfall, and it made headlines in legal publications. Jackson pleaded guilty and asked to be sent to Angola. This was an unusual request. The prison still evokes fear and is generally reserved for people sentenced to more than 40 years. His lawyers were against it, but he insisted. \"It's my drag queen approach to life,\" he said. \"If you're going to send me to prison, well, send me to Angola.\"\n\nIt was also a way for Jackson to derive meaning from the wreckage. Angola is where Louisiana's injustices intersect most dramatically, and Jackson knew his rare expertise in post-conviction law would be valuable. He had always understood that pro se petitioners got short shrift, but in Angola he was shocked to see how many of the prisoners' claims had merit and how few managed to receive any attention from the courts.\n\nShortly after he arrived, Jackson met an inmate convicted of stealing a carpenter's level. He had been sentenced to life without the possibility of parole under the state's repeat offender law; his previous crimes included stealing a pack of cigarettes and a lighter and writing two bad checks to Home Depot. The man, Jackson wrote in a petition arguing the sentence was illegal, will die in prison over a \"tool with a little bubble in it, worth less than $10.\" It was denied. Jackson petitioned the court on behalf of a man who had found evidence of his innocence in a police report the prosecutor had withheld at trial. His request for a new hearing was rejected. As was a filing on behalf of a severely disabled man who was still in prison months after he should have been released, and another for a man who claimed he had lost his vision because of the prison's neglect.\n\nAlmost all of Jackson's filings speak not just to the particulars of a specific case but to the devastation wrought by the entire Louisiana criminal justice apparatus. The state has more people serving life without parole than Texas, Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama and Mississippi combined. In a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court for a man serving a life sentence for possession of cocaine, Jackson protested \"this destruction of another black family - perhaps a tiny tragedy in the civil rights Chernobyl that has been Louisiana's war on drugs.\" There was no evidence linking the man to the ounce of cocaine found at a relative's home, he wrote. \"And yet here he sits still, sentenced to life without parole on the banks of the Mississippi,\" he continued. \"As seen from the heavens, the scene on these banks has changed little since 1820.\" The petition was denied.\n\nBy the time Jackson met Schexnayder, his writing had progressed \"from disappointed but fundamentally-confident-in-justice liberal to just this side of burn-the-house-down nutter,\" he told me. The indignation he felt over the 5th Circuit's pro se cases was not because of the court's obvious indifference to the inmates; this he had come to expect. \"It's that the judges got caught saying they don't care,\" he said. \"The poor already knew this and have known it viscerally all their lives - from the way every arm of the state has ever treated them.\" But here was a case in which they had irrefutable proof, and still there was no outrage on their behalf. \"It was crickets,\" he said. \"They got caught so, so red-handed, and the response of all the other courts has been a collective shrug.\"\n\nSchexnayder, who had a criminal record so long that he would almost certainly have landed in prison for life much sooner had he been Black, could hardly be seen as the face of Louisiana's criminal justice failures. But of all the 5th Circuit petitioners, Schexnayder was the one who had somehow managed to keep his case alive. Jackson knew that a victory for him could open the door for the others. He began working on a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing the 5th Circuit's reconsideration of Peterson's denials did little more than allow the judges to \"whitewash the scandal .\"\n\n\"Why would the Louisiana 5th Circuit think it could get away with such appalling misconduct?\" Jackson wrote. \"To this there is an easy, if disturbing, answer: Because it has. And now, the lower federal courts are deferring to that court's decisions in the affected cases, many involving a sentence to life without parole.\"\n\nJackson realized the case was unlikely to get any attention unless he could line up some outside help. AEDPA had been a particular target of one of his mentors, Alex Kozinski, a federal judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for whom Jackson had clerked. Frequently mentioned as a candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, Kozinski had been one of the country's most prominent judges, a Reagan appointee known for his cutting and iconoclastic opinions. In a 2015 law review article, he wrote that AEDPA was \"a cruel, unjust and unnecessary law that effectively removes federal judges as safeguards against miscarriages of justice.\" He called for its repeal.\n\nBut like Jackson's, Kozinski's career had come to an abrupt end. In 2017, amid multiple accusations of sexual harassment, he left the bench. Within the legal world, especially around issues of criminal justice, however, his opinion still commanded respect, even among some of his accusers . Jackson knew that his involvement could draw attention to Schexnayder's petition. He called the former judge at his home in California. Kozinski thought the 5th Circuit's conduct - and the federal courts' unwillingness to wade into it - might provide a valuable test for AEDPA. The law requires deference to the work of state court judges, but what if those judges hadn't done the work? Kozinski asked the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers to submit a brief in support of Schexnayder's petition and recruited another former clerk to write it.\n\nIn April 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court asked the state of Louisiana to submit a response to Schexnayder's claims, signaling that someone on the court was interested in considering the case. The justices were initially scheduled to vote in April on whether to grant a full hearing, but they postponed that decision nine times over the next eight months. The delays gave Jackson hope. Maybe one of the justices was working to drum up enough votes to give the case a chance or preparing a powerful dissent from the court's refusal to hear it.\n\nInstead, on Dec. 9, 2019, the court unanimously rejected the case. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a short opinion , citing technical issues with Schexnayder's original petition to the Louisiana federal court as her reason for agreeing with her colleagues' decision. She ended with what seemed like an encouraging note to the prisoners, saying the 5th Circuit's reconsideration of Peterson's rulings brings up \"serious due process concerns.\"\n\n\"I expect that lower federal courts will examine the issue of what deference is due to these decisions when it is properly raised,\" she wrote.\n\nBut the federal courts will not get that chance. The 454 prisoners whose denials the 5th Circuit \"reconsidered\" have exhausted their appeals and can no longer ask federal judges to weigh in on the 5th Circuit's conduct. In refusing to hear Schexnayder's case, the Supreme Court has prevented the episode from being raised in federal court again.\n\nWhen Jackson found out that Schexnayder's petition had been rejected, he struggled to articulate his reaction. After a long silence, he said, \"Well, they got away with it.\"\n\nSince they petitioned the Louisiana Supreme Court, some of the 454 inmates have died in prison. Others have been released after serving their time or have had their sentences reduced as a result of recent criminal justice reforms. But at least 170, including Schexnayder, are still incarcerated. They continue to petition the appellate courts, trying to show new evidence of their innocence or to argue that their sentences should be reduced.\n\nAfter the Schexnayder episode, Jackson set his sights on the modest goal of filing as many petitions as he could before his release. \"I'm going to make them tell me they're OK with all these crazy cases,\" he said. When he walked out the prison gates in June 2020, he smuggled several office boxes containing case files he had secretly copied - documents he would use to help the men he was leaving behind. In the months that followed, Jackson found lawyers to represent dozens of prisoners and worked with legal nonprofits to reduce the sentences of more than 100 people. Among them are several men whose pro se petitions the 5th Circuit had ignored.\n\nIn the years that Peterson was rejecting pro se petitions, the 5th Circuit denied claims that ended in at least five exonerations. Four of these men were freed only after the New Orleans Innocence Project agreed to represent them. Nathan Brown was one of them. He had appealed to the organization early in his incarceration, and lawyers there had discovered that the victim's dress had been preserved as evidence and could be tested for DNA.\n\nHurricane Katrina put a stop to everything, though, and for a long time Brown heard nothing. While he waited, the 5th Circuit reviewed Peterson's denial and concluded that the failure of Brown's attorney to introduce DNA evidence was \"within the scope of trial strategy\" and did not constitute inadequate counsel.\n\nThen, on his 39th birthday, Brown received a letter from the national Innocence Project, saying it would take his case. Brown's new lawyers compelled the Jefferson Parish district attorney to send the dress for DNA testing, and the analysis identified another man - a convicted felon - as the attacker. In 2014, after 16 years, 10 months and 18 days, Brown was exonerated.\n\nIt's been nine years since Brown was released, and he's still trying to find stable ground. He has struggled with addiction and depression. He cycles through phones. He has lost his Social Security card so many times the federal government will no longer replace it. The dreams he had for himself when he was in prison - that he would go to college, that he would help his daughter to rise above the poverty that had plagued his own childhood - have slipped so far out of his reach he can hardly allow himself to believe in them. Still, he knows how exceptional his case is.\n\n\"They have a lot of guys in prison that are filing claims,\" he told me. \"They're not all saying, 'I didn't do this.' They're just saying, 'The way you sentenced me is wrong. The crime doesn't warrant all this time you gave me.' But they can't come home, because once they get you, they got you, and the courts - they're not listening. They don't see you.\""

      "text": "Experts sound off after messy and chaotic Trump-Biden debate\n\nAlison Gash , University of Oregon ; Alexander Cohen , Clarkson University , and Rashawn Ray , University of Maryland\n\nPresident Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden took part in a presidential debate Sept. 29 that exemplified the lack of civility in American politics. The president frequently interrupted and spoke over his challenger, Biden told Trump to \"shut up,\" and few issues were discussed in enough depth to provide much information to undecided voters. We asked three scholars to discuss themes brought up by moderator Chris Wallace of Fox News, who struggled throughout the debate to keep control.\n\nAlison Gash, University of Oregon\n\nWallace opened with a question on the minds of many voters: Who should fill the vacancy left by Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death ?\n\nDemocrats viewed Ginsburg as the last line of defense for abortion rights, voting rights, the Affordable Care Act and other traditionally liberal policies. Trump has nominated conservative jurist and scholar Amy Coney Barrett to fill Ginsburg's seat on the bench.\n\nTrump has already exerted a significant influence over the federal bench. He has appointed more federal appellate judges than any president since Carter . If Barrett is appointed, he will have filled more Supreme Court vacancies than any president since Ronald Reagan and will have shaped the court in ways that could last generations.\n\nBiden all but conceded the appointment as a lost cause, pivoting to one of the few areas where a Biden win could conceivably limit the conservative influence of the Roberts Court - by stalling potential litigation over the Affordable Care Act. The Trump administration has publicly and actively supported litigation to overturn the ACA. Judge Barrett, Biden reminded viewers, believes the ACA is unconstitutional. Even with Ginsburg on the bench, the ACA enjoyed only fragile court support. Biden intimated that continued litigation in an even more conservative Supreme Court could limit health care coverage for millions of Americans.\n\nBiden mentioned Roe v. Wade - and Barrett's likely opposition - only as an afterthought. In response, Trump stated cryptically, \"There's nothing happening there. And you don't know her view on Roe v. Wade.\"\n\nOn the whole, the debate did little to resolve questions about the future of the court - other than to shore up Supreme Court nominations as political bombs with volatile consequences.\n\nRashawn Ray, University of Maryland\n\n\"Why should voters trust you ... to deal with the race issue facing this country?\"\n\nWallace asked a straightforward question about the troubling state of race relations in America, but the two candidates answered it in very different ways. Biden highlighted the \"systemic injustice in this country, in education, in work, and in law enforcement\" that required an approach grounded in equity, equality, decency and the Constitution.\n\nTrump pivoted quickly to \"law and order\" and brought up the Biden co-sponsored 1994 Crime Bill - legislation that has long been criticized for contributing to the disproportionate mass incarceration of Black Americans. But recent Trump advertisements have tried to suggest that violence will increase under a Biden presidency - paradoxically showing images of unrest under the current Trump administration. Trump seemingly wanted to attack this \"tough on crime\" Biden of the 1990s while simultaneously portraying his rival as being in league with what the president would like voters to believe is an unruly and violent left.\n\nThe reality is different. Despite over 90% of Black Lives Matter protests being nonviolent, much of the media's focus has been on the less than 10% of demonstrations that have turned violent. This debate did nothing to dispel that false narrative.\n\nIn fact, some of the violence of recent months has been committed by right-wing extremists . But when asked directly to condemn white supremacy, Trump hesitated and seemed to be searching for words. Instead, he sent a shoutout to the Proud Boys - a group deemed to be a hate organization by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Trump said, \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by. But I'll tell you what, somebody's got to do something about antifa and the left.\"\n\n\"He's the racist,\" said Biden during their exchanges.\n\nMeanwhile, on policing policy, Biden proposed a 21st-century redo to bring various stakeholders to the table.\n\nBut eerily for Republicans and Democrats - and not at all in keeping with the debate itself - Trump and Biden seem to espouse similar views about the defunding police movement.\n\n\"I am totally opposed to defunding the police. They need more assistance,\" said Biden during the debate. Earlier Trump had stated, \"There won't be dismantling of our police, and there's not going to be any disbanding of our police.\"\n\nAlexander Cohen, Clarkson University\n\nWhen asked about the integrity of mail-in ballots, Biden and Trump offered different answers. Biden projected faith in the mail-in system. Unsurprisingly, Trump continued to assault the integrity of an election using mail-in ballots. This echoes his mantra in 2016, when he argued that the popular vote count was incorrect and fraudulent - a notion that was widely debunked .\n\nLikewise, the assertion that mail-in voting leads to voter fraud has been widely challenged . Most studies suggest that voting by mail does not benefit one party over the other and that voting by mail is not prone to manipulation .\n\nHowever, such studies on voting by mail tend to examine scenarios where state and local governments were well prepared for ballot distribution. The increased demand for mail-in voting brought on by COVID-19 is creating at least some confusion among voters . It is plausible that not all states are ready to handle the flood of mail-in votes. This could complicate the voting process and prolong vote counts in some states.\n\nSuch delays could be incredibly significant. The last time a key state struggled to tally votes was 2000. Then, the Supreme Court intervened to halt a recount in Florida, handing the victory to Republican George W. Bush over Democrat Al Gore in a close presidential race.\n\nIf disputes over mail-in ballots linger beyond Election Day, the Supreme Court may again intervene. If President Trump's Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett is quickly confirmed , conservatives will enjoy a 6-3 majority on the Court. Three of these justices will have been appointed by Trump.\n\nTrump has laid the groundwork for disputing the results of any close election. If neither candidate wins decisively, the nation should brace itself for a lengthy, and divisive, struggle.\n\nSuch a struggle could be dangerous to American democracy because it may undermine fundamental faith in the electoral process. While rule of law generally prevails when close elections are disputed , it does appear that the United States could be headed toward uncharted territory.\n\nWhat question were you hoping to hear tonight that was left out in the midst of this chaotic debate?\n\nCohen: I would have liked to ask: \"Do you think that there are consequences for the decreasing civility in American politics, as demonstrated in this debate?\"\n\nGash: I would like to have seen a question about the role of the court in preserving checks and balances. This is, what I think, Wallace was trying to get at in his question about court-packing. But the question fell flat.\n\nRay: Black people are disproportionately more likely to experience police use of force, even when they are unarmed and not attacking. How do we reduce racial disparities in use of force - as with George Floyd and Breonna Taylor - and improve relations between Black communities and law enforcement?\n\nAlison Gash , Associate Professor of Political Science, University of Oregon ; Alexander Cohen , Assistant Professor of Political Science, Clarkson University , and Rashawn Ray , Associate Professor of Sociology, University of Maryland\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Why Democrats lost the House: An interview with Ralph Nader\n\nThe Chris Hedges Report: Why Democrats lost the midterm election with Ralph Nader youtu.be\n\nThe midterm elections are over, and two more years of Congressional gridlock are likely in store. Republicans have taken a narrow majority in the House, while Democrats have held the Senate. What do we make of the current political landscape, where rhetoric runs so hot but so little gets done? And what can we expect from the 2024 presidential elections? Ralph Nader joins The Chris Hedges Report for a post-mortem on the 2022 midterm elections, and to discuss how the people can retake Congress from corporate influence.\n\nStudio: Adam Coley, Cameron Granadino\n\nPost-Production: Cameron Granadino\n\nChris Hedges: The total cost of the 2022 federal midterm elections is projected to exceed $9.3 billion. But what do we get from what must surely be the most expensive electoral system on the planet? There's little real choice. The dismantling of our democracy which took place over the last few decades on behalf of corporations and the rich has been a bipartisan project, leaving only the outward shell of democracy. The courts, legislative bodies, the executive branch, and the media, including public broadcasting, are captive to corporate power. There is no institution left that can be considered authentically democratic. The corporate coup d'etat is over. They won. We lost.\n\nThe wreckage of this corporate coup is appalling, endless and futile wars to enrich a military-industrial complex that bleeds the US Treasury of half of all discretionary spending, de-industrialization that has turned US cities into decayed ruins, the slashing and privatization of social programs including education, utility services, and healthcare, which so over one million Americans account for one-fifth of global deaths from COVID, although we are 4% of the world's population.\n\nDraconian forms of social control embodied in militarized police functioning as lethal armies of occupation in poor urban areas, the largest prison system in the world, a virtual tax boycott by the richest individuals and corporations, mone- saturated elections that perpetuate our system of legalized bribery, and the most intrusive state surveillance of the citizenry in our history.\n\nHow are we to interpret these elections which will create even more political paralysis with Republican control of the House, and what should we expect in the next presidential election? Joining me to discuss the political landscape and the wake of the midterm elections is former presidential candidate and consumer advocate Ralph Nader. You can find him at ralphnader.substack.com.\n\nRalph, let's begin with the midterms. It wasn't the blowout of the Democratic Party that many expected. How do you interpret what happened?\n\nRalph Nader: Well, coming off the list that you just described about the situation in this country and its impact on the world, my first reaction was there are 535 people in the Congress who could change it all, and they don't all have to be unanimous. It could just be a plurality or a majority of members. So what are we waiting for? Check off your entire list, Chris, and we got the votes. The corporations don't have the votes. They have money, but the members of Congress want the money to get the votes against their primary or general election opponents.\n\nSo it just is very intriguing that people thrash around groaning, moaning, being sickened, injured, blocked, discriminated against, deprived, and they don't focus on the Khyber Pass, which is Congress. Whether we like it or not, that's the institution that has the greatest authority to take on these big corporations and take on the predators and to drive peace in the world instead of war and empire. We're listening to all these recountings of the ills, ailments, and injustices and the brutish scenarios coming up in the future with climate disruption and reneging on any kind of compact with posterity, and we don't focus on Congress.\n\nSo in the midterm election, they're running around the campaigns like they're ward bosses. We're going to fix this pothole here and we're going to make sure that there's a public service there. Instead of looking at the big picture of the concentration of power, they're doing this piecemeal retail assurances of the public, which of course drives the expectation of the people even lower. When you drive the expectation lower as to what members of Congress are running for election, or challengers running to defeat them, when you control those expectations at such a low level, the members of Congress get away with their responsibility for the country under the Constitution, we the people.\n\nThey're the ones who get to tax new power in Congress, the spending power, the confirmation of judges and officials in power, the right not to go to war. There's no end to it. So I keep saying if all of these efforts for justice around the country, small, large, national, local, do not focus on Congress and the state legislatures and the town councils, they're going to be spinning their wheels forever as this country is driven into the ground.\n\nChris Hedges: I want to talk about the impediments, though. First of all, you have redistricting. So most races are not actually competitive. The Democratic Party redistricted the seat that Dennis Kucinich had to drive him out. Number two, if you aren't awash in money and you saw this in your own campaign, you were drawing crowds. I think you filled Madison Square Garden. Everybody had to pay $5 to get in. So I don't know how many thousands of people, but you didn't have access to television, which would've given you an audience of millions. So there are serious impediments to essentially breaking the power of this duopoly.\n\nRalph Nader: Yeah. But the impediments melt away if people organize in every congressional district to reflect the congruence of left-right opinion in this country, which is deleted from the news accounts who like to talk about polarization, red state, blue state, conservative, liberal. We know that on the fundamental necessities of life, there's a huge convergence, 70, 80, 90% in the polls. There was one poll a few years ago, Chris, 90% of people wanted to break up the big banks. 90%.\n\nYou got 75% or so want universal healthcare even without a major party pushing for it. It just goes on and on. Whether it's cracking down on corporate crooks, whether it's changing the campaign finance system, whether it's controlling what people own, like pension funds and mutual funds which together own three-quarters of the stock of the companies on the New York and Nasdaq Stock Exchanges. So the people have the power, but they've allowed it to be seized because they don't do their homework back home.\n\nThey don't spend time on their civic responsibilities. They don't say to the members of Congress, hey, we're the ones who have the sovereign power. You've got it from us and you're using it against us, and we're not going to tolerate it anymore. So the only place where democracy comes before work is in a dictionary. So we have to stop spinning our wheels and recounting disaster after disaster when we can control the legislative bodies, local, state, and national. Look at the initiatives in Nebraska and right-wing states. They have passed minimum wage increases against massive corporate opposition, saturating the television, Florida, Arkansas.\n\nIn one conservative state, South Dakota, the Republican dominated legislature, the governor, and the corporations all opposed an initiative to constitutionalize Medicaid, not just to send a statute, but to put the Constitution of South Dakota. Who won? The people won. Because they started working. They rolled up their sleeves. Otherwise, all we're doing is documenting despair, perdition, pessimism, which discourages people and turns them into cynics, which leads to withdrawal from the political arena and which makes the corporation's life all the way to the bank.\n\nChris Hedges: I want to talk about fear because I think Matt Taibbi wrote that most Americans don't vote for what they want, they vote against the political figure they hate. The divisions largely, as you point out, there's a majoritarian opinion on many of the issues you just cited. But there is this cultural divide, and people employ fear. Biden's own record in the Senate and even as vice president is pretty appalling, from supporting Anita Hill to I think five years before the invasion of Iraq he talked about taking Saddam down. He, of course, as rehabilitated Mohammed bin Salman, a fervent supporter of the apartheid state in Israel. He fought school busing.\n\nAggressively, he sponsored the 1994 crime bill and three strikes you're out, third violent penalty law where you can't get parole, NAFTA, Glass-Steagall. So these are not issues that we look back on and support, but the Democrats, like the Republicans, play on this fear, the fear of - And I do see, as you do, a figure like Trump to be frightening and these fringe candidates to be frightening, but it seems that that is the primary currency at this point of our political system.\n\nRalph Nader: Yeah. Well, there are millions of people who don't buy it. We need tens of millions of people who don't buy it. We need people talking to one another in the neighborhoods. We need people to turn out for town meetings. There are all kinds of jurisdictions in this country that allow for the referendum to be stocked with all kinds of progressive legislation at the state and local level. Most people don't even know about it. They don't even use it. Why? Because our schools don't begin teaching these children civic knowledge, civic skills, and civic experience. Learn by doing.\n\nAll of this comes down to how much time do people spend to produce a deliberative democracy that wages peace and justice, equality and foreseeing and forestalling the perils for our posterity like climate disruption. That's what it comes down to. If we don't address it at that level, if we don't highlight the victories of the people over powerful interests that occur from time to time in this country, we're just documenting despair, producing discouragement, producing withdrawal from the political system, and people then just dive into their own discouraging lives and watch entertainment, bet on sports. We gotta turn it around.\n\nThe nice thing about this approach is you only have to turn around a supermajority of 535 people. You know what they want more than anything else. They want to win, and that means votes. So you focus votes to nullify the effect of money. I mean, look at the victory of Summer Lee coming out of Pittsburgh. She's 32 years old and she's going to be the next representative in the House from an area around Pittsburgh. She was opposed by corporations. She took on the dark side of the United Steelworkers. They opposed her.\n\nAPAC put $1 million to $2 million just before the election to defeat her. She beat them all. How? She developed a grassroots coalition based on the principle that they all bleed the same color. It doesn't matter what labels they put on themselves. She forged this coalition and beat them all. It's a spectacular story, which The New York Times is not spending much time reporting on. They're too obsessed with Taylor Greene, the madcap representative from Georgia, putting her on the cover of The New York Times Magazine .\n\nThey give all kinds of attention to crazy right-wing groups and institutes. They give people the impression nothing's happened on the progressive side during the election period. So Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh is not Ann Arbor, it's not Cambridge. It has a lot of conservatives, and she beat them all. Energy. Civic energy is what's needed. You have 82% of Republicans against Citizens United, which is a Supreme Court decision over a decade ago that said corporations could give unlimited money for or against candidates in elections. Unlimited. A lot of it dark money.\n\nYou got over 80% of Republicans, when they're polled that, are against. It has to be organized. Otherwise, the divide and rule strategy of the two-party duopoly fronting for giant corporations will forever control the people who are the only people who have the votes. I mean, bad as corporates are, Chris, they don't yet have the vote. Not yet, at least.\n\nChris Hedges: Let's talk about the inevitable paralysis with the Republican control of the House. Biden's already been stymied by Manchin and Democrats who essentially vote as Republicans. What is that going to mean for going ahead?\n\nRalph Nader: Well, it's going to mean that nothing's going to be done other than the routine stuff of just passing budgets for government agencies. The Republicans have such a narrow margin. They're not going to get anything done, and they'll be blocked in the Senate. So it's two years of very little being done. And it's the Democrat's own fault. I mean, it's the worst Republican Party in history. You cannot find a Republican Party since 1854 that has so many positions that are against the health, safety, and economic interests of children, of women, of workers, of small taxpayers, of communities all over the country, of consumers, of patients.\n\nThis is a vicious, callous, inbred, ignorant, corporate indentured, corrupt party. What are the Democrats? They lose to them, and then they say, hey, look at the pundits. They said it was going to be a red wave and it wasn't a red wave. So it's a victory. That's how they fooled the people. Victory? What would happen if there were no polls and no pundits? Would the Democrats have pleaded victory? They lost the House of Representatives, for heaven's sake.\n\nChris Hedges: Right. Well, they lost because, on all of the issues they just cited, they have surrendered.\n\nRalph Nader: Yeah, they lost because it starts with the nomination process. They exclude third parties, okay. Who's they? Who's they? It's the state legislatures. They have these ballot access barriers and allow this to happen. They lost for reasons of their own making. For example, John Larson of Connecticut wanted to increase the benefits of social security. It hasn't been increased, he said, in 40 years. So he puts in a bill and it's very comprehensive, and he's sweet-talked by Nancy Pelosi and his chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the crypto Republican, but Democrat in name only, Richard Neal from Western Massachusetts.\n\nHe starts pressing. He says, why aren't you passing this through the House? He says, well, it's not the right time. We don't want to be accused of excessive spending. So he drafts the letter, which he wants his Democrats in the House to co-sign. He drafts the letter accusing the Senate of sabotaging the whole process, the Democrats in the Senate using the filibuster as an excuse. He says, let the Republicans filibuster. Let them go on the floor hour after hour after hour on natural television against increasing the benefits of social security for millions of elderly Americans. He was blocked and stymied.\n\nNow, any active citizenry, Chris, would've dug into that and made it a major issue inside the Democratic Party. That's the way you start upending these indentured senior Democrats who have concentrated power in the hands of three members: Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, and the third one. And they control the subcommittees and the committees and all this started with Newt Gingrich, who did this when he was speaker in 1995, and the Democrats never changed it.\n\nHe cut budgets of committees, cut staff, cut the GAO, the monitor of spending, executive branch, waste, fraud, and abuse, eliminated the Office of Technology Assessment, which would've exposed some of these massive weapon and civilian technology boondoggles, and the Democrats inherited it. So you always have to go back to the people. What do they think? What do they know? What do they want for their families? You got to organize it. Look, labor never became unionized without rank and file people. Co-ops were never established without rank and file people. It never was top-down. It's all bottom-up. So we got to focus on the people here.\n\nChris Hedges: Let's talk about Trump, who's just announced. What's your read on the Trump candidacy and the future tactics of the Republican Party?\n\nRalph Nader: Well, first of all, under section 3 of the 14th Amendment, any state can ban him from running for election based on this Jan. 6 findings of insurrection. That's the insurrection section of section 3 of the 14th Amendment. The Jan. 6 committee report is going to be out soon and they could recommend that to the states and say, start enforcing section 3 of the 14th Amendment. If he is banned from running for reelection in four or five states, he can't possibly compete even at the primary level.\n\nThe second thing is, Jack Smith, the new special counsel, people have said that you couldn't pick someone better for the Attorney General to pursue two criminal violations against Trump which could end in his indictment, and it's very unlikely that he's going to have much course to the primary victory if he's under indictment from those two violations, not to mention the one that's being prepared in New York state against him. One was stealing classified documents, that's one that Garland is handing over to the special counsel to pursue. The other, of course, is the insurrection on Jan. 6.\n\nOf course, Garland left out about 10 other violations of federal statutes, including the Hatch Act, which was designed to prevent presidents from using the power of the federal government and property against their opponents. He had campaign events on the White House lawn. He signed millions of checks, twisting arms over at the treasury for the pandemic relief programs. Garland just is giving him a free pass on one violation after another. Bruce Fein and I have written Garland listing all these violations more than once. Never get an answer.\n\nHowever, two criminal statute violations are more than enough to retire Trump. Now, if that doesn't occur, Trump is going to want a lot of competition at the primary level. That's how he wins. He had 16 Republican opponents in the primary in 2016, and he is the best known. He's the most egregious attention getter, and he would like that. He'd split it 10 ways. He'd say, okay, Youngkin, Virginia, come on board. Primary me. Okay, DeSantis, come on board, primary me. But I don't think he's going to get that far.\n\nChris Hedges: So what do you see happening?\n\nRalph Nader: I see he's going to be indicted. There are civil suits against him, obviously, from assaulted women and other people that he's fleeced. I think there may be a coordinated rebellion in the Republican Party itself. You just don't get anywhere with other Republican candidates, senators, governors, if the head of the ticket is not only under indictment, but may have actually been convicted.\n\nChris Hedges: But the Republican Party, which has essentially become this proto-fascist entity, and certainly while Trump held sway, cultish, isn't going to change its stripes, is it?\n\nRalph Nader: No, it changes its camouflage. They really pursue everything Trump has pursued, whether it's immigration on the border. Wall Street, Trump and them are on the same page. The whole plutocratic system, the anti-union system, the tax cuts at an all time low for the super rich and the big corporations. But it's the camouflage. He embarrasses them. He uses bad language. He attacks people specifically. He doesn't have their style of control. But that's serious. That's a serious problem among politicians. That's just not a matter of cosmetics. They know they can lose a lot of traction with his kind of blunderbuss and his lying and his mischaracterizing people and accusing people of homicides without a single bit of evidence like he has done in the past.\n\nThey're also afraid of the violence of his audiences that he can unleash, and that can make you lose an election. That could scare a lot of conservative Republicans around the Midwest and elsewhere when they see the eruption of violence. He's said there are going to be riots in the street if he's denied the nomination. So there is a real deep conflict, not over economic issues, but over how the party presents itself to a public that it doesn't want to scare. He scares people.\n\nChris Hedges: Does the inevitable paralysis now within Congress empower the Republican Party for the presidential elections?\n\nRalph Nader: No, because they'll be viewed as the do-nothing House, can't get anything done. If the Democrats are smart, they'd go on the floor of the House, as the Republicans did against them years ago, and throw the gauntlet down. Why aren't you supporting Medicare, Medicaid, social security? Why are you against kids? Why don't you extend the $300 a month child tax credit that went to 58 million kids from conservative and liberal families and you blocked the extension in January? Why are you freezing the minimum wage at a paltry $7.25 cents an hour when you're making huge money in terms of what the taxpayer is paying you and all the benefits?\n\nThey could just throw one gauntlet: Why are you soft on corporate crime? Why are you letting these corporate crooks get away with ripping off the people and endangering their health and safety? That's what they got to do. If they don't do that, we'll just have another very, very close election. Any kind of idiosyncratic event can tip it one way or another regardless of the left-right polls supporting basic change in this country coming in at 70, 75, 80, 80, 85%. I mean, you can't stop that. That's an unstoppable coalition.\n\nIf the Democrats will get rid of their corporate political media consultants who are losing race after race for the Democrats because they have corporate clients throughout the year and they're conflicted and because they don't want to do a ground game, which is what democracy is all about, and they want the 15% huge television buys. Right now in Georgia, there's this runoff, Chris, between Senator Warnock and Herschel Walker. Warnock has spent $20 million already, charging that Walker is neither competent nor knowledgeable nor fit to be a US senator. Well, they're going to put $200 million between them from Nov. 8 to Dec. 6.\n\nJust imagine $200 million coming in there. How much of it is the ground game? Well, as little as possible, if the consultants have a say, which is what they do, they want the 15% commission. So Warnock should go around the state of Georgia and change his heavy focus on Walker, everybody knows about Walker now, and start saying, go vote for a raise. Go vote for universal health insurance. Go vote for cracking down on the corporate crooks that are on your back and in your pocketbook every day. Go vote for freedom to vote. Go vote for freedom for women, equal pay for equal work. Go vote for the children. Get that $300 back into poor families' pocketbooks.\n\nI mean, that's the way you win an election. But the corporate consultants who should be the subject of major exposes by The Washington Post , New York Times , Wall Street Journal , they got the reporters. They're the ones who are destroying the Democratic Party, and they've been doing it for years.\n\nChris Hedges: Well, if Walker or Warnock went around and called for those kinds of programs, that corporate money would dry up, wouldn't it, Ralph?\n\nRalph Nader: There's no time for it to dry up. They already got it. Dec. 6 is the runoff. By the way, the more you can get people on your side by your message and your policies, the less money you need. I mean, the money wasted on these TV and social media ads is just staggering. Not only is it wasted, it's the same ad, it's dull, it's repetitious, it's not authentic, and it irritates people. In other words, it boomerangs against itself. Summer Lee was tremendously outspent, but she had a ground game.\n\nChris Hedges: Right. That was former presidential candidate and consumer advocate Ralph Nader. You can find him at ralphnader.substack.com.

      "website": "https://www.theatlantic.com",
      "text": "The Crime-Bill Debate Shows How Short Americans' Memories Are\n\nIn hindsight, complicated policy conversations get flattened into stark shades of right and wrong.\n\nIt was a moment that may come back to haunt Joe Biden-perhaps as soon as tonight's Democratic debate: In an earlier round this summer, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey wheeled on the former vice president, attacking his sponsorship of the 1994 federal crime bill with a roundhouse punch. \"There are people right now in prison for life for drug offenses,\" Booker said, \"because you stood up and used that tough-on-crime phony rhetoric that got a lot of people elected but destroyed communities like mine.\"\n\nIt is true that the bill-which extended the death penalty to 60 new crimes, stiffened sentences, offered states strong financial incentives for building new prisons, and banned a range of assault weapons-helped lead to the wave of mass incarceration that's resulted in the United States accounting for 25 percent of the world's prison population.\n\nBut Booker's implication that the law was simply a cynical sop to fearful white voters is at odds with the political realities of the time, when the bill passed with bipartisan support, including the votes of more than two-thirds of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), and with the backing of other black leaders beyond Capitol Hill. This is the second straight presidential election in which the crime bill has loomed as a loaded issue-Hillary Clinton was excoriated from the left in 2016 for her past support-and it will doubtless continue to surface as long as Biden is in the race. The current furor over the law is an object lesson in just how short the American political memory has become, and in how, in hindsight, complicated policy debates get flattened into stark shades of right and wrong.\n\n\"I tell people today that the crime bill wasn't that controversial back then,\" says Michael Waldman, who in 1994 was a domestic-policy aide in Bill Clinton's White House, and who now heads the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law, a leading advocacy group and think tank on criminal-justice issues. Waldman personally deplores the bill's effect on incarceration rates, even as he admires what he sees as its more salutary results, such as its emphasis on community policing.\n\n\"It was welfare reform that was controversial\" at the time, he explained to me, referring to Clinton's campaign promise to fundamentally restructure the social safety net. But for Biden, Waldman said, \"it's really hard to spend your time as a candidate explaining the past to the present. The view of that crime bill has hardened into a caricature. It's a question of how much energy is it worth trying to fight it.\"\n\nIndeed, from the distance of 25 years, it is difficult to fathom the effect that three decades of rising crime, and the explosion of the crack-cocaine epidemic in the mid-1980s, had on public sentiment-or the political pressure it generated. Consider this as context: Today is precisely as distant in time from 1994 as 1994 was from the Charles Manson murders, the moon landing, and Woodstock. In other words, a world away. Public opinion around the bill has shifted rapidly in recent years. Just four years ago, Biden was still proudly referring to the law as the \"1994 Biden Crime Bill.\" As the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he championed the bill and helped shepherd its passage.\n\nRead: Did Bill Clinton see this coming?\n\n\"It's not only the Democratic Party that's changed,\" Waldman said. \"It's the country and the context that's changed. Crime between 1960 and 1990 tripled ... The level of social disruption and panic that caused is hard to explain now, because since then the crime rate has been dropping. We are living with the consequences of the reaction to the very real social crisis of the time.\"\n\nRepresentative James Clyburn of South Carolina, who as House majority whip is the highest-ranking black member of Congress, voted for the crime bill, and he made the same point in vivid terms. In his first congressional race, in 1992, Clyburn once explained to an audience in the historic black enclave of Atlantic Beach that he opposed mandatory minimum prison sentences, which would become a feature of the 1994 legislation. \"Those people darn near lynched me in that meeting, and there wasn't a single white person in the room,\" Clyburn told me. \"The atmosphere back then-the scourge of crack cocaine and what it was doing in these African American communities-they were all for getting this out of their community.\"\n\n\"I don't care what color you are, if you are a criminal, you aren't going to like the crime bill,\" then-Representative Kweisi Mfume of Maryland, the chairman of the CBC, said at the time in an interview with the Los Angeles Times . \"Beyond that, if you are looking for some sense of security, for bans on weapons that are in our streets, for additional police officers and for programs for inner-city and rural young people, the crime bill helps you.\"\n\nOther leading black voices did oppose it , however, including former Representative John Conyers of Michigan, a senior Democrat who at the time was on the Judiciary Committee, and Representative Maxine Waters of California. The NAACP called it \"a crime against the American people.\"\n\nThe very elements of the law that liberals now condemn were the product of the way Washington used to work-the sometimes messy result of bipartisan give-and-take. The bill, which also included some $30 billion to help hire 100,000 new police officers and more than $6 billion for crime-prevention programs, was the kind of compromise that is all but unheard of today. And it nearly failed altogether on a procedural vote just before its passage, when an unlikely alliance of legislators banded together to defeat the measure that would have sent the bill to the House floor: Republicans who mocked the bill's funding for social programs such as \"midnight basketball,\" conservative Democrats who opposed the assault-weapons ban, and black and white liberal Democrats who objected to the expansion of the death penalty.\n\nThe bill was eventually revived, in part because the White House acceded to stiffer sentencing provisions to win the Republican votes needed for passage in the face of conservative Democrats' sustained opposition to the assault-weapons ban. It passed the House on a vote of 235-195 and the Senate by a final tally of 61-38. As my colleague Ronald Brownstein has noted , the bill also had the crucial backing of a coalition of 10 African American mayors, representing cities such as Detroit, Atlanta, Cleveland, Denver, and Baltimore.\n\nFormer Representative Charles Rangel of New York, the longtime Democratic congressman from Harlem, was one of 11 CBC members to oppose the bill in the end. But he is quick to note that opposing it was much easier for him-coming from a safely blue district-than it was for members in more competitive places who faced an overwhelming wave of public pressure to act against crime.\n\n\"There were some of us who had the luxury-not the courage, but the political support-to look at the far-reaching negative impact of the bill,\" Rangel told me. \"Whether it was Reagan or Clinton, the whole idea was that longer and tougher jail sentences [were] going to, in the long run, be another burden that our community would face at the expense of not having access to education and other social programs. Only people that came from a district that had no national reelection problems had the luxury of voting against this type of legislation. The only thing people wanted from us was to do something.\"\n\nRangel recalled that when the White House first became aware of his opposition, Clinton aides arranged for a group of black clergymen to meet him \"to raise hell about my position.\" He said he patiently argued with the group that longer sentences and \"three strikes\" provisions were not the solution. But he said it was a challenge. \"When you go to town-hall meetings, people just demand that you explain what the hell you're going to do to reduce crime. I can't overemphasize. You're not there to give a course in sociology or the impact of slavery or poor schools and lack of economic opportunity or self-esteem,\" Rangel added. \"When someone is scared to walk the goddamn streets, anything that you can tell them to help alleviate that fear is going to be accepted.\"\n\nClinton himself pitched the bill as a boon for justice for black Americans. In a memorable 1993 address to a convention of the predominantly black Church of God in Christ at Mason Temple in Memphis, from the pulpit where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his last sermon, Clinton imagined what King would say if he came back from the dead. \"I did not live and die to see the American family destroyed,\" Clinton said, trying to channel King's thoughts in a way that may seem presumptuous for a white politician in 2019, but that was generally praised back then. \"I did not live and die to see 13-year-old boys get automatic weapons and gun down 9-year-olds just for the kick of it. I did not live and die to see young people destroy their own lives with drugs and then build fortunes destroying the lives of others. That is not what I came here to do.\"\n\nA 2016 analysis by the Brennan Center concluded that the 1994 bill contributed both to the subsequent decline in crime and to the doubling of the rate of imprisonment from 1994 to 2009. Criminologists disagree on the reasons for the overall crime decline-citing factors from an aging population to decreased alcohol consumption-but there is a general consensus that the sheer increase in the number of police on the streets (together with computer-aided policing tactics) played a role. From 1990 to 1999, the number of police officers nationwide rose 28 percent, from 699,000 to 899,000, partly due to funding in the crime bill .\n\nRead: Cory Booker exposed a key Biden weakness\n\nAt the same time, it is beyond dispute that incarceration rates also increased dramatically, spurred by the provision of the crime bill that funneled $12.5 billion for prison construction to states that required inmates to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences. A 2002 Urban Institute study found that from 1995 to 1999, nine states adopted such laws for the first time, while 21 others changed existing laws to qualify for the funds. By 1999, a total of 42 states had such laws in place. At the same time, many states passed their own tougher sentencing laws, which only exacerbated the trend. Communities of color bore the brunt of the crime bill's effects. In a damning 2016 op-ed , the author and scholar Michelle Alexander argued that, \"by the end of Clinton's presidency,\" many African American men had been \"relegated to a permanent second-class status eerily reminiscent of Jim Crow.\"\n\nThrough the years, Biden didn't just promote the crime bill occasionally-he made its passage a centerpiece of his decades of legislative accomplishment in Washington. Tough-on-crime rhetoric and policy proposals became a signature part of his political persona, not just in Delaware but on the national stage. He long supported civil-asset seizures of drug proceeds, mandatory sentences for drug possession, and harsh differences in penalties for the possession of crack and powder cocaine.\n\nBiden portrayed the 1994 bill as an unalloyed political asset for a Democratic Party that had been at pains since the late 1960s to prove its bona fides on crime. \"The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is now for 60 new death penalties,\" he said on the Senate floor at the time. \"The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 100,000 cops. The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 125,000 new state prison cells.\" And, he added, \"I'd like to see the conservative wing of the Democratic Party.\"\n\nToday he is taking a decidedly different approach, with a criminal-justice plan that would send federal funds to states if they reduce incarceration rates, and that would provide increased spending for child-abuse-prevention, education, and literacy programs if states eliminate mandatory minimum sentencing for nonviolent crimes. He also proposes rolling back disparities between the treatment of crack and powder cocaine, and ending the federal death penalty.\n\nThe crime bill had electoral consequences from the start. In the 1994 midterm elections, the assault-weapons ban was deeply damaging for some of its Democratic supporters. Representative Jack Brooks of Texas, the bill's House sponsor and the Judiciary Committee chairman, lost the seat he had held for more than four decades because of the ban-despite his personal opposition to it. The Democrats lost the Senate and control of the House for the first time in 40 years.\n\nEven a year later, public feeling against the assault-weapons ban was so intense in some quarters that when I happened to run into Chuck Schumer, one of the leading backers in the House, while he was on vacation in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, I was surprised to see him sporting a week-long growth of beard. When I asked him why, he explained that then-FBI Director Louis Freeh had warned him that he was the subject of death threats, so he thought he had best disguise his appearance.\n\nToday the bill's political consequences still resonate, but in almost precisely the opposite way. \"Anyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected,\" Donald Trump tweeted earlier this year. \"In particular, African Americans will not be able to vote for you.\" That is probably an overstatement, but as Booker's debate attack on Biden showed, the issue remains politically delicate.\n\nFor his part, Clyburn is philosophical about his vote for the bill. \"We operated on the theory that we were not going to lose in '94,\" he said. \"We put stuff in there that we thought we would build on. But then we lost in 1994, and all of the punitive stuff, the Republicans kept all that and got rid of some of the good stuff.\"\n\nClyburn argued that political progress is not made on a linear plane, but swings like a pendulum. \"We went left in this country in the 1994 bill when we put in the assault-weapons ban. But when it came time for renewal, we didn't have the votes. The country had gone back to the right,\" he said. \"The country's going to move back to the left. We're going to get another assault-weapons ban. I don't say it's going to happen next year. But we're going to get one.\""

      "text": "The Misplaced Criticism of Clinton's Crime Bill\n\nIt wasn't perfect, but critics forget that the legislation was a bipartisan effort addressing a genuine need.\n\nAt a particularly precarious moment during the congressional maneuvering over the 1994 crime bill, President Bill Clinton received a powerful endorsement from an influential group on the debate's frontlines.\n\nIn July 1994, ten African American Democratic mayors-including those from Detroit, Atlanta, Cleveland, and Denver- urged Congress to approve the measure , even after House and Senate negotiators removed from the final bill a House-passed provision making it easier for prisoners on death row to challenge their sentences as racially discriminatory.\n\nWhile they supported that idea, the black mayors wrote, they did not believe its demise should outweigh other elements in the bill that they valued-particularly new federal funding to hire more police and launch prevention program for at-risk young people. \"We cannot afford to lose the opportunities this bill provides to the people of our cities,\" the mayors wrote.\n\nThat fragment of forgotten history illuminates two key points about the 1994 crime bill, which has reemerged as a flashpoint in the primary campaign between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, particularly after Bill Clinton's heated encounter with protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement last week in Philadelphia.\n\nOne is that the legislation was a genuine compromise that advanced priorities of left and right-but also required concessions from each side (like liberals jettisoning the death penalty provision). The second is that the historical record doesn't support the left's now-common assertion that the crime bill was primarily a politically motivated concession by Clinton to white racial backlash. While Clinton undoubtedly considered the bill part of his effort to rebuild the Democrats' national coalition after its collapse during the 1980s, he believed the best way to do that was to make genuine progress against a rising tide of violent crime.\n\n\"The renaissance of American cities is one of the great stories of the last quarter century and cities had their backs against the wall because of crime and violence in the early 1990s,\" says Bruce Reed, Clinton's chief domestic policy adviser in the White House. \"It was impossible to make economic progress without restoring order and mayors...community leaders and police were crying for help.\"\n\nThe 1994 crime bill was far from perfect. But today's sharpest criticism of the legislation-encapsulated by the Philadelphia protester's sign last week that read \"Clinton crime bill destroyed our communities\"-ignores the genuine need the bill addressed.\n\nThe bill followed years of elevated violence that had many cities reeling. According to FBI statistics, against the backdrop of expanding crack use, the violent-crime rate increased by over 25 percent just from 1980 through 1992. By the early 1990s, the murder rate in the nation's largest cities peaked at over 30 per 100,000 residents; in New York City alone, 2,245 people were murdered in 1990. This violence most heavily afflicted African American, Hispanic, and low-income communities. So destabilizing were these waves that in late 1993 a task force of mayors (chaired by Wellington Webb, the black mayor of Denver) urged Clinton to mount an \"all-out\" federal effort against \"the continuing epidemic of violent crime in our cities.\"\n\nThe crime bill that eventually emerged from extended negotiations between and within the two parties in Washington attacked this problem from every angle. It blended priorities of Clinton and congressional Democrats-principally more money to hire 100,000 police officers, funding for enhanced prevention programs and a ban on semi-automatic assault weapons-with the top goal of congressional Republicans, big grants to states to build more prisons. Both sides contributed to a complex mix of sentencing changes that expanded federal mandatory-minimum sentences and required states (as a condition of obtaining the prison money) to toughen sentences for violent offenders, but also experimented with alternatives like boot camps and drug courts. Several leading African American legislators (including John Conyers and Maxine Waters) opposed the final bill, but many others (such as James Clyburn and Kweisi Mfume) supported it-as did leading Hispanic and white liberals (from Luis Gutierrez to Richard Durbin and then-Representative Bernie Sanders.)\n\nBill Clinton has correctly conceded that some of these changes were \"overly broad\" and accelerated a trend toward excessive incarceration that most criminal-justice experts say was primarily rooted in federal and state decisions during the previous two decades . But that's only part of the crime bill's legacy. The violent crime rate has plummeted by nearly 50 percent since 1994, back to its lowest level since 1970. Across the 30 largest cities the murder rate has dropped by about two-thirds since 1990 . While the crime bill was not the principal factor in those declines-which researchers have struggled to precisely explain-most studies agree the legislation contributed to the gains, particularly by enabling cities to hire more police officers and requiring them to move into street patrols.\n\nClinton wanted to act against crime partly to blunt its use as a wedge issue against Democrats. But he believed the best way \"to address that was by taking seriously the problem of crime,\" says Michael Waldman, Clinton's former chief speechwriter and now president of the Brennan Center for Justice. On crime, Clinton believed his signature formulation of expanding opportunity while demanding personal responsibility offered the approach most likely to produce progress, not only politically but also substantively. The crime bill's impact was always constrained by the limits of Washington's impact on policing, a preponderantly local activity. And in some ways the bill unquestionably misfired. But on the whole it did more to advance, than impede, the ongoing revival of America's largest cities."

      "text": "Rorschach's Crime Bill\n\nBill Clinton's unforced error on the trail places the 1994 Violent Crime Act back in play.\n\n\"The ones that won't let you answer are afraid of the truth,\" Bill Clinton admonished protesters at a campaign event for Hillary Clinton today in Philadelphia. The protesters peppered him with questions about the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, a piece of legislation that has become wrapped up in this campaign cycle as Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders both build criminal justice promises built on dismantling parts of it. The crime bill, a signature accomplishment of his presidency and one to which Hillary has been tied , has been identified as a main culprit behind mass incarceration .\n\nBill's response certainly won't do Hillary any favors. In an 11-minute answer that wandered along a path of condescension, through tone-deaf comments, and into a difficult digression about Black Lives Matter and Africa, Clinton attempted to provide a defense for the bill and give context to the reasons why it had such broad support. He talked over protesters and attempted to play up the crowd to shout them down. His tone and talking points play especially poorly given Hillary's early struggles in engaging with young black protesters. But even though his diatribe will be widely covered as a major misstep in Hillary's campaign, it does provide some real insight as to why the issue of the crime bill seems to animate so much of the Democratic primary race.\n\nIn comments last year, Bill expressed real regret over the outcomes of the act. \"I signed a bill that made the problem worse,\" Clinton said. \"And I want to admit it.\" His statements today were not necessarily a full repudiation of that contrition, but definitely a walk-back: He regrets some of the outcomes, but not his decision-making process. Clinton used much of the same language as he did in 1994 to defend the bill. He also gave somewhat baffling defenses of the efficacy of the bill, claiming massive decreases in crime that were directly attributable to its penchant for incarceration. This is probably not true .\n\nWhen pressed on the harsh sentencing laws in the act, Bill gave the standard defense. \"I talked to a lot of African American groups, he said. \"They thought Black Lives Mattered. They said 'take this bill' because our kids are being shot in the street by gangs.\"\n\nClinton is right in many senses. The act was pitched in exactly the same way to black groups in the 90's and many of them accepted it as an ugly, scorched-earth tactic, that was necessary to bring down immense crime rates in black neighborhoods. The coalition was broad, and much of the current Democratic leadership class, including Sanders and Vice President Biden, was prominently involved. As Clinton noted in the speech today, that crime bill also contained several less-controversial provisions that are still widely embraced today by liberals, such as the assault-weapons ban, overtures toward community policing, and the Violence Against Women Act. Hillary was not directly connected to the crime bill's passage, but her strong support of it on the trail, including ex post facto racial fear-mongering about \"super-predators\" has earned her the ire of many criminal-justice activists.\n\nAs she and Sanders both sprint away from the crime bill, pushing plans to end mass incarceration, it binds both of them, especially informing the age and racial differences between the two campaigns. Sanders has explained his support of the bill as a reluctant compromise that allowed him to press for reforms to the death penalty, assault weapons, and domestic violence, despite its other problematic provisions. He seems to have been forgiven by young voters, who are likely more apt to see the bill as an abject failure.\n\nHillary Clinton's relationship with the crime bill is more complex. Her coalition might be the coalition of voters that wanted it: older white and black voters in rural areas and black urban centers. While she has fully wrapped herself in the mantle of reform, promising to roll back the bill's terrible effects, I suspect some of the old ideas about its necessity still linger among her base, even among the black voters. The tie to Bill Clinton's legacy is strong, and many older voters still remember him-rightly or wrongly-as a president who brought order out of a drug-fueled crime wave. In some places, there is a strong generational divide about the necessity of Black Lives Matter, which arose as a sort of generational blowback to the crime bill, even among black people. Reports of Sanders's struggles to hold older black audiences captive with his criminal-justice message roughly outline this divide.\n\nOf course, the crime bill is easily regarded today as bad, racist policy. Even though-as Bill noted in his speech-state and local prisons are responsible for most of the incarceration epidemic, the federal government still plays an immensely important role in setting the national-policy table, and federal laws do interact with state laws to amplify incarceration. And Clinton's justifications don't quite hold up, as many of those who joined the coalition did so begrudgingly and with on-the-record reservations. Nor were liberals and black people unanimous on the issue. A group led by Reverend Jesse Jackson, who has long had ties to both the Clintons and Sanders, denounced the bill in no uncertain terms , foreseeing its effects on incarceration.\n\nIt seems the best way to describe the 1994 crime bill is that it was a tragedy of groupthink produced under the pressure of real, imminent dangers. The need to fix a crisis gave way to an awful policy that-as awful policies tend to do-further marginalized poor people and people of color. Younger voters, especially younger black voters who are seeing its effects up close, don't have to grapple with the legacy of a mistake. They react to what they experience, which is a clearly bad policy. But Bill Clinton's own attitude toward the bill displays the struggle that must be happening for many of those in the original coalition. Even Dr. Frankenstein couldn't bring himself to kill his monster."

      "text": "How Biden Killed Prison Education\n\nMy friend Twist and I are both incarcerated. But I'm getting a college degree, and he, like most prisoners in recent decades, hasn't been able to.\n\nIn 2010, I joined a creative-writing workshop taught by a volunteer at New York's Attica prison, where I was incarcerated at the time. A handful of us sat in a half circle in a classroom in an otherwise deserted school building on prison grounds. We were reading one of the Best American Essays collections. I checked to see where the stories had originally been published and eventually decided to send a piece about gun control to one of the listed magazines. In 2013, The Atlantic published \"A Convicted Murderer's Case for Gun Control,\" my professional debut.\n\nAround that time, my writing instructor secured funding for a pilot community-college liberal-arts program in Attica. Just 23 of the 2,300 men in the prison made the cut, including those of us who had been in the workshop. Attica was a crazy place in which to study or find peace of mind. Alarm bells rang. Men cut and stabbed one another. Tear gas dropped. After class, I'd return to my cell in C Block and sometimes watch sanctioned fight nights, in which two prisoners would brawl on the tier while guards looked on and wagered on them.\n\nThis is how I first met Gerard Johnson, who calls himself Twist. He was 23 years old, one of the brawlers, and my neighbor. He had a lot of problems back then, not least because he had renounced his affiliation with the Bloods. When my cell door popped for evening class, I'd hear Twist tell his neighbor in the cell across the tier that he wished he could be in college. He was a knucklehead, but he was also a curious kid who yearned to learn. I shared with Twist a book of essays; he was drawn to W. E. B. Du Bois. In the midst of the chaos, Twist and I would talk about what I was learning in sociology class. Leaning on our gates, we would discuss questions such as, Do our circumstances shape our lives? Do we make choices that carve our own paths? Do we even have choices?\n\nTwist told me he never knew his father; he had grown up mostly with his mother and his little brother. He had experienced and observed lots of violence at a young age, both inside and outside the household. When Twist was in his early teens, his mother had a seizure and died.\n\nIn June 2006 , when Twist was 16, he and some teenage friends were walking in the East Village in the early-morning hours and crossed paths with a man named Kevin Aviance, a drag-queen nightclub singer. After an exchange, Twist and his friends jumped him. It may have been one of Twist's blows that broke the singer's jaw. A report from New York's district attorney said that Twist was using anti-gay slurs; Twist says he didn't even know Aviance was gay, and that it was just an argument that turned into violence. At 17, he was convicted of first-degree assault as a hate crime and sentenced to 17 years in prison. (He says he only pled guilty because he was advised to take a plea deal.)\n\nTwist wrote raps with a nice flow and had an overall creative vibe. He showed me a couple chapters of a book he was working on; I showed him my pieces about gun control. At the time, many of us wanted to get out of Attica and hoped to land a transfer to one of two prisons, Sing Sing and Eastern, that were closer to New York City. Both prisons had-and still have-robust privately funded undergraduate programs. Sing Sing's is funded largely by a nonprofit called Hudson Link for Higher Education in Prison (run mostly by formerly incarcerated people), and Eastern's through the Bard Prison Initiative. The atmosphere of those institutions was less tense because of those opportunities. By 2015, after committing myself to my studies, I earned an associate's degree. I was transferred to Sing Sing the next year and lost track of Twist.\n\nRead: How the war on drugs kept black men out of college\n\nIn September 1994, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, penned by Joe Biden, then a Delaware senator. Experts have had plenty of debates about whether the 1994 crime bill was responsible for a subsequent decline in crime rates to record lows, a rise in the prison population to record highs, or neither . (After peaking in the 2000s, the prison population has begun to fall; crime rates continue to decline as well.) What most scholars and policymakers can't do-but I can-is demonstrate how the crime bill has affected life on the inside of the American prison.\n\nIn prisons, two policies in particular, both enacted as part of the law, created a culture of ignorance, violence, and hopelessness. First, a ban on incarcerated individuals receiving Pell Grants led to the removal of most of the college programs-which once numbered more than 770-that were operating in nearly 1,300 facilities nationwide. Second, \"truth in sentencing\" policies offered states up to $10 billion to build new prisons, on the condition that they restructure sentencing laws to keep violent offenders in prison for at least 85 percent of their sentence, without regard for the individual's behavior or rehabilitation efforts.\n\nIn the years that followed, prison schoolhouses emptied and prison yards filled. Gang activity and violence within the prisons increased. TV watching proliferated, enervating prisoners and their creative development. In effect, the crime bill achieved one of the traditional goals of incarceration: to incapacitate prisoners.\n\nRead: The crime-bill debate shows how short Americans' memories are\n\nIn 2001, I was a gun-toting thug-a wannabe, really. At the age of 24, I shot and killed a 25-year-old man in Brooklyn. In 2004, after almost three years on Rikers Island, I arrived at Clinton Correctional Facility, near the Canadian border, with a sentence of 28 years to life, for murder and selling drugs. I had a ninth-grade education. By then, higher-education programs, which ran on private funds, operated in only a few New York prisons; I was not fortunate enough to be serving in one of them. So I politicked in the yard, watched a lot of TV, did a lot of drugs, and was sent to solitary confinement. (In 2006, I spent six months in Upstate Correctional Facility, a new, clean, and horrible prison devoted largely to solitary confinement-one of several such facilities built across New York with cash from the crime bill.)\n\nThe turn for me came after I was transferred to Attica, New York's most notorious prison, best known as the site of the 1971 uprising that left 43 dead. One of the prisoners' demands had been access to better education programs. In the decades after the uprising, prison programs began spreading widely-up until the passage of the 1994 crime bill. When I first arrived at Attica, in 2007, there were no higher-education programs. A few years later, I got involved with the writing workshop, and then the pilot college program. Because those programs were available to very few of us, Twist didn't even bother to apply. He figured that his disciplinary record would make him an unattractive candidate-and he was probably right.\n\nIn 2015, U.S. Department of Education administrators, realizing the harm caused to prisoners by the removal of Pell Grants, created a new program called the Second Chance Pell Experimental Sites Initiative, a three- to five-year pilot program offering some prisoners an education. Now, 67 educational institutions serve 12,000 incarcerated students in state and federal prisons annually. The program has recently been expanded by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.\n\nEven though the total education debt of Americans-$1.5 trillion-is more than what they owe on their credit cards or auto loans, there's still a lot of support for the Restoring Education and Learning Act (REAL Act), which would lift the 25-year-old ban on prisoners receiving Pell Grants. Even the National District Attorneys Association, representing the prosecutors who put us here, supports the REAL Act. Many top Democrat presidential candidates-including Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris-have also signed on to sponsor it. Even Joe Biden, the author of the original crime bill, has said in a campaign speech that he would extend Pell Grants to prisoners, though he hasn't commented directly on the REAL Act.\n\nRead: The tricky politics of educating prisoners\n\nIn 2016, New York's governor, Andrew Cuomo, allotted almost $7.5 million from the state's criminal-forfeiture funds for college classes in prison. Private funders matched the amount. While New York's prisons are again starting to thrive when it comes to higher education, most incarcerated people serving time across America aren't as fortunate as I've been.\n\nA 2019 report by the Vera Institute of Justice and the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality said a full repeal of the Pell Grant provision of the 1994 crime bill could make hundreds of thousands of prisoners eligible for higher education. Recidivism rates would likely decline, too, according to the report, saving states a combined $365.8 million per year. With an education, formerly incarcerated people will likely find better-paying jobs, resulting in a $45.3 million increase in combined earnings during the first year after leaving prison.\n\nIt's impossible to understand the potential impact of reinstating Pell Grants without seeing how much was lost after they were taken away. Many prisoners will soon be returning to society, as they reach the end of their sentences. Because I have benefited from a few rare opportunities and learned my craft, I know that I will be all right when I get out. I don't know if Twist will.\n\nIn Sing Sing, I was able to continue my education. I will graduate in June with a bachelor's degree in behavioral science from Mercy College. I have been incarcerated for nearly 18 years, and it costs New York taxpayers more than $60,000 annually to keep me locked up. Still, my educational opportunities, particularly that first writing workshop, have been instrumental in helping me build a career as a freelance journalist from the inside. In this year's Best American Writing collection, my name is nestled on the cover between Leslie Jamison's and Jill Lepore's. I am now a contributing editor at Esquire, and I recently started a podcast . Last year I paid taxes on the income I earned from writing. It was the first time in my life I paid taxes; drug dealers don't report to the IRS. Paying taxes may seem like a weird thing to be proud of, but I brag about it because it shows that I'm no longer a criminal, even though I'm still in prison.\n\nLast year, Twist transferred to Sing Sing, and we reconnected. He was happy to hear that I had made it as a journalist. I was sad to see that he had not yet entered a college program. Though he was proud of having participated in a Yale University educational program during a stint at the Green Haven Correctional Facility, he had also gotten in more trouble and spent several stints in solitary. I helped him get on a pre-college waiting list. He joined the prison drama program and, to his excitement, landed a part in a play, 1776 , being put on at Sing Sing. Still, he will leave prison without a degree. Twist's conditional release is in December 2020. He'll be 30 years old. It frustrates me-and him-that he's so ill-prepared for life on the outside. He has made poor decisions while incarcerated that have shaped his life. He knows that. But the 1994 crime bill created a set of circumstances on the inside that lumped troubled young men together and offered them no opportunities. That has shaped Twist's life, too.\n\nWanting to understand how Twist's and my diverging experiences with higher education in prison had shaped our future prospects, I asked Twist if I could interview him. He agreed. So on a sticky August evening in Sing Sing, I talked with him. We met in a schoolhouse classroom with caged windows. He has a boxer's frame, and, except for a few scars from razor tag back on Rikers Island, he has a smooth-skinned, handsome face. Outside the window in the prison yard, handballs thwock ed and men yelled about nothing. But Twist was talking to me about something serious-his life.\n\nHe estimates that he has been in 100 fights since he has been locked up. He also draws, sings, raps, and writes-he's a genius, he told me. \"I'm not just some gay-bashing Blood,\" he said. \"There's so much more to me than that.\" When I asked if he thinks college would have helped him hone his talents, he responded, \"It would have added to the understanding of Twist.\" (Twist refers to himself in the third person on occasion. I'm okay with it.)\n\nWhile we were talking, a fight broke out in the yard. Men came into the classroom, interrupting our conversation, in order to watch the violence through the windows. Since he was talking about deeply personal matters, Twist was annoyed, and he asked the men to leave. One of them took offense at his tone. They had a standoff that came dangerously close to blows. When the man left the room, I asked Twist if he thought he could have handled the situation better. \"Two lions can't live on the same mountain,\" he replied. \"I felt like that guy was challenging me.\"\n\nWith everything I have going on in my life now, I could never see myself engaging in such a senseless battle. But that was precisely the point, right? All the missed opportunities for education have left Twist with little outlet for his passion and pain.\n\nA few days after I met with Twist, I learned that someone had broken his jaw-the same injury he and his friends inflicted years ago on Kevin Aviance. Twist has since been recovering on a special unit. The play he was so excited about was performed in his absence, with someone else in his role. Back in the classroom, weeks ago, I asked him about his plans after his release. \"There's a lot I want to do when I get out, but I really don't know what I'm going to do,\" he told me. \"I'm actually afraid.\"\n\nThis article is part of our project \"The Presence of Justice,\" which is supported by a grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation's Safety and Justice Challenge."

      "text": "The Crisis of Public Order\n\nThe Crisis of Public Order The Department of Justice now says that \"stranger murders\" have become \nfour times as common as family killings, and that the chances of getting \naway with one exceed 80 percent. Scholars say the nation's murder rate may \nsoon double. The author says we are inviting this \"long descending night\" \nof crime by teaching violent young people that \"we will do almost anything \nnot to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or our character as \npeople of decency and strength.\" by Adam Walinsky N umbers are useful in politics, because they are more neutral than \nadjectival speech and because they express magnitude--that is, they can \ntell us not only that we confront a danger but also what the depth and \ndirection of the danger are. The most important numbers in America deal \nwith violence--not the occasional terrorist violence but the terror of \neveryday life as it is lived by millions of citizens today, and as it \nthreatens to become for many more of us for the rest of this century and \nbeyond. During his campaign and since, President Bill Clinton has spoken of a \nsharp decline in the strength of the nation's police forces. In the 1960s \nthe United States as a whole had 3.3 police officers for every violent \ncrime reported per year. In 1993 it had 3.47 violent crimes reported for \nevery police officer. In relation to the amount of violent crime, then, we \nhave less than one tenth the effective police power of thirty years ago; \nor, in another formulation, each police officer today must deal with 11.45 \ntimes as many violent crimes as his predecessor of years gone by. Title I of the 1994 crime bill intends to add 100,000 police officers \nnationally by the year 2000. (Most experts believe that far fewer new \nofficers--perhaps 25,000--will actually be hired. For the purposes of this \nargument, though, let us assume the larger figure.) There are now some \n554,000 officers serving on all state and local police forces; 100,000 \nmore would be an increase of 18.4 percent. Rather than having 3.47 times \nas many violent crimes as police officers, we would have 2.94 times as \nmany; or, each police officer would face not 11.45 times as many violent \ncrimes as his predecessor but 9.7 times as many. All this assumes that the \nnumber of violent crimes will not increase over the next several years; if \nit does, the number of violent crimes relative to police officers will \nagain increase. If we wished to return to the ratio of police officers to violent crimes \nwhich gave many of us peace and security in the 1960s, we would have to \nadd not 100,000 new police officers but about five million . When this \nnumber was mentioned to some Department of Justice staffers recently, they \ngiggled; and it is understandable that the idea of such a national \nmobilization, such tremendous expenditures, should strike them as \nlaughable. However, the American people are already paying out of their \nown pockets for an additional 1.5 million private police officers, to \nprovide, at least in part, the protection that the public police are \nunable to furnish. Private police guard office buildings, shopping malls, apartments. \nBusinesses pay them to patrol certain downtown streets, such as those \naround New York's Grand Central Station and public library. And they \npatrol residential areas. Private patrol cars thread the streets of Los \nAngeles, and more than fifty applications are before the city council to \nclose off streets so as to make those patrols more effective. Across the \ncountry much new housing is being built in gated communities, walled off \nand privately guarded. We are well on the way to having several million \npolice officers, and the next decade will bring us much closer. If current \ntrends continue, however, most of the new officers will be privately paid, \navailable for the protection not of the citizenry as a whole--and \ncertainly not of citizens living in the most violent ghettos and housing \nprojects--but of the commercial and residential enclaves that can afford \nthem. Between these enclaves there will be plenty of room to lose a \ncountry. ONE LONG DESCENDING NIGHT P eople hire police officers because they are afraid--above all of \nviolence. Their fear is occasionally a source of puzzlement and mild \ndisdain in the press, which cannot understand why so many Americans say \nthat crime is the nation's most urgent problem and their own greatest \nfear. Indeed, all through 1993 official agencies claimed that crime was \ndeclining. The FBI said that violent crime in the first six months was \ndown three percent overall, and down eight percent in the Northeast. For crime to be down even eight percent would mean that a precinct that \nhad had a hundred murders in 1992 had ninety-two in 1993. But nobody came \naround on New Year's Day of 1993 to give everyone's memory a rinse, \nobliterating the horrors of the previous year. The effect is not \ndisjunctive but cumulative. By the end of 1993, ninety-two additional \npeople had been murdered. Many people can also remember years before 1992, in large cities and in \nsmall. In 1960, for example, six murders, four rapes, and sixteen \nrobberies were reported in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1990 that city, with \na population 14 percent smaller, had thirty-one murders, 168 rapes, and \n1,784 robberies: robbery increased more than 100 times, or 10,000 percent , \nover thirty years. In this perspective a one-year decrease of seven \npercent would seem less than impressive. New Haven is not unique. In Milwaukee in 1965 there were twenty-seven \nmurders, thirty-three rapes, and 214 robberies, and in 1990, when the city \nwas smaller, there were 165 murders, 598 rapes, and 4,472 robberies: \nrobbery became twenty-one times as frequent in twenty-five years. New York \nCity in 1951 had 244 murders; every year for more than a decade it has had \nnearly 2,000 murders.  We experience the crime wave not as separate \nmoments in time but as one long descending night. A loved one lost echoes \nin the heart for decades. Every working police officer knows the murder \nscene: the shocked family and neighbors, too numb yet to grieve; fear and \ndesolation spreading to the street, the workplace, the school, the home, \ncreating an invisible but indelible network of anguish and loss. We have \nexperienced more than 20,000 such scenes every year for more than a \ndecade, and few of them have been truly forgotten. The memory of a mugging may fade but does not vanish. Nine percent of \nthose responding to a recent poll in New York Newsday said that they had \nbeen mugged or assaulted in the past year. This suggests an annual total \nfor the city of more than 600,000 muggings and assaults (remember also \nthat many people, in poor neighborhoods especially, are assaulted more \nthan once). That would be four times as many robberies and assaults as are \nreported to the police department. The Department of Justice says that not \nthree quarters but only half of all violent crimes go unreported: it may \nbe that many report as having happened \"last year\" an incident from more \nthan a year ago. Nevertheless, these are stunning numbers, especially when some other \ncommon crimes are added in. Eight percent of those polled (implying \n560,000 New Yorkers) said their houses or apartments had been broken into; \n22 percent (1,540,000) said their cars had been broken into. In all, 42 \npercent (nearly three million New Yorkers)said they had been the victims \nof crime in 1993. And, of course, about 2,000 were murdered. This is what \nit means to say that crime in 1993 was down eight percent. In October of 1994 the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that violent \ncrime had not, after all, declined in 1993 but had risen by 5.6 percent. Several years ago the Department of Justice estimated that 83 percent of \nall Americans would be victims of violent crime at least once in their \nlives. About a quarter would be victims of three or more violent crimes. \nWe are progressing steadily toward the fulfillment of that prediction. A TWENTY-YEAR FRAUD EXPOSED O ur greatest fear is of violence from a nameless, faceless stranger. \nOfficials have always reassured citizens by stating that the great \nmajority of murders, at any rate, are committed by a relative or an \nacquaintance of the victim's; a 1993 Department of Justice report said the \nfigure for 1988 was eight out of ten. Unfortunately, that report described only murders in which the killer was \nknown to prosecutors and an arrest was made. It did not mention that more \nand more killers remain unknown and at liberty after a full police \ninvestigation; every year the police make arrests in a smaller proportion \nof murder cases. In our largest cities the police now make arrests in \nfewer than three out of five murder cases. In other words, two out of \nevery five killers are completely untouched by the law. When a killing is a family tragedy, or takes place between friends or \nacquaintances, the police make an arrest virtually every time. When the \npolice make an arrest, they say that the crime has been \"cleared\"; the \npercentage of crimes for which they make arrests is referred to as the \nclearance rate. Because murder has historically been a matter principally \namong families and friends, the homicide clearance rate in the past was \noften greater than 95 percent, even in the largest cities. As late as 1965 \nthe national homicide clearance rate was 91 percent. However, as crime has \nspread and changed its character over the past generation, clearance rates \nhave steadily dropped. In the past two years the national homicide \nclearance rate averaged 65.5 percent. The rate in the sixty-two largest \ncities is 60.5 percent. In the very largest cities--those with populations \nover a million--the rate is 58.3 percent. The missing killers are almost certainly not family members, friends, or \nneighbors. Rather, they are overwhelmingly strangers to their victims, and \ntheir acts are called \"stranger murders.\" Here is the true arithmetic: The \n40 percent of killings in which city police departments are unable to \nidentify and arrest perpetrators must overwhelmingly be counted as \nstranger murders; let us assume that 90 percent of them are committed by \nkillers unknown to the victims. That number is equivalent to 36 percent of \nthe total of all city murders. We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

The Atlantic Monthly; July 1995; The Crisis of Public Order; Volume 276, \nNo. 1; pages 39-54.\n\nThe Department of Justice now says that \"stranger murders\" have become \nfour times as common as family killings, and that the chances of getting \naway with one exceed 80 percent. Scholars say the nation's murder rate may \nsoon double. The author says we are inviting this \"long descending night\" \nof crime by teaching violent young people that \"we will do almost anything \nnot to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or our character as \npeople of decency and strength.\" by Adam Walinsky N umbers are useful in politics, because they are more neutral than \nadjectival speech and because they express magnitude--that is, they can \ntell us not only that we confront a danger but also what the depth and \ndirection of the danger are. The most important numbers in America deal \nwith violence--not the occasional terrorist violence but the terror of \neveryday life as it is lived by millions of citizens today, and as it \nthreatens to become for many more of us for the rest of this century and \nbeyond. During his campaign and since, President Bill Clinton has spoken of a \nsharp decline in the strength of the nation's police forces. In the 1960s \nthe United States as a whole had 3.3 police officers for every violent \ncrime reported per year. In 1993 it had 3.47 violent crimes reported for \nevery police officer. In relation to the amount of violent crime, then, we \nhave less than one tenth the effective police power of thirty years ago; \nor, in another formulation, each police officer today must deal with 11.45 \ntimes as many violent crimes as his predecessor of years gone by. Title I of the 1994 crime bill intends to add 100,000 police officers \nnationally by the year 2000. (Most experts believe that far fewer new \nofficers--perhaps 25,000--will actually be hired. For the purposes of this \nargument, though, let us assume the larger figure.) There are now some \n554,000 officers serving on all state and local police forces; 100,000 \nmore would be an increase of 18.4 percent. Rather than having 3.47 times \nas many violent crimes as police officers, we would have 2.94 times as \nmany; or, each police officer would face not 11.45 times as many violent \ncrimes as his predecessor but 9.7 times as many. All this assumes that the \nnumber of violent crimes will not increase over the next several years; if \nit does, the number of violent crimes relative to police officers will \nagain increase. If we wished to return to the ratio of police officers to violent crimes \nwhich gave many of us peace and security in the 1960s, we would have to \nadd not 100,000 new police officers but about five million . When this \nnumber was mentioned to some Department of Justice staffers recently, they \ngiggled; and it is understandable that the idea of such a national \nmobilization, such tremendous expenditures, should strike them as \nlaughable. However, the American people are already paying out of their \nown pockets for an additional 1.5 million private police officers, to \nprovide, at least in part, the protection that the public police are \nunable to furnish. Private police guard office buildings, shopping malls, apartments. \nBusinesses pay them to patrol certain downtown streets, such as those \naround New York's Grand Central Station and public library. And they \npatrol residential areas. Private patrol cars thread the streets of Los \nAngeles, and more than fifty applications are before the city council to \nclose off streets so as to make those patrols more effective. Across the \ncountry much new housing is being built in gated communities, walled off \nand privately guarded. We are well on the way to having several million \npolice officers, and the next decade will bring us much closer. If current \ntrends continue, however, most of the new officers will be privately paid, \navailable for the protection not of the citizenry as a whole--and \ncertainly not of citizens living in the most violent ghettos and housing \nprojects--but of the commercial and residential enclaves that can afford \nthem. Between these enclaves there will be plenty of room to lose a \ncountry. ONE LONG DESCENDING NIGHT P eople hire police officers because they are afraid--above all of \nviolence. Their fear is occasionally a source of puzzlement and mild \ndisdain in the press, which cannot understand why so many Americans say \nthat crime is the nation's most urgent problem and their own greatest \nfear. Indeed, all through 1993 official agencies claimed that crime was \ndeclining. The FBI said that violent crime in the first six months was \ndown three percent overall, and down eight percent in the Northeast. For crime to be down even eight percent would mean that a precinct that \nhad had a hundred murders in 1992 had ninety-two in 1993. But nobody came \naround on New Year's Day of 1993 to give everyone's memory a rinse, \nobliterating the horrors of the previous year. The effect is not \ndisjunctive but cumulative. By the end of 1993, ninety-two additional \npeople had been murdered. Many people can also remember years before 1992, in large cities and in \nsmall. In 1960, for example, six murders, four rapes, and sixteen \nrobberies were reported in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1990 that city, with \na population 14 percent smaller, had thirty-one murders, 168 rapes, and \n1,784 robberies: robbery increased more than 100 times, or 10,000 percent , \nover thirty years. In this perspective a one-year decrease of seven \npercent would seem less than impressive. New Haven is not unique. In Milwaukee in 1965 there were twenty-seven \nmurders, thirty-three rapes, and 214 robberies, and in 1990, when the city \nwas smaller, there were 165 murders, 598 rapes, and 4,472 robberies: \nrobbery became twenty-one times as frequent in twenty-five years. New York \nCity in 1951 had 244 murders; every year for more than a decade it has had \nnearly 2,000 murders.  We experience the crime wave not as separate \nmoments in time but as one long descending night. A loved one lost echoes \nin the heart for decades. Every working police officer knows the murder \nscene: the shocked family and neighbors, too numb yet to grieve; fear and \ndesolation spreading to the street, the workplace, the school, the home, \ncreating an invisible but indelible network of anguish and loss. We have \nexperienced more than 20,000 such scenes every year for more than a \ndecade, and few of them have been truly forgotten. The memory of a mugging may fade but does not vanish. Nine percent of \nthose responding to a recent poll in New York Newsday said that they had \nbeen mugged or assaulted in the past year. This suggests an annual total \nfor the city of more than 600,000 muggings and assaults (remember also \nthat many people, in poor neighborhoods especially, are assaulted more \nthan once). That would be four times as many robberies and assaults as are \nreported to the police department. The Department of Justice says that not \nthree quarters but only half of all violent crimes go unreported: it may \nbe that many report as having happened \"last year\" an incident from more \nthan a year ago. Nevertheless, these are stunning numbers, especially when some other \ncommon crimes are added in. Eight percent of those polled (implying \n560,000 New Yorkers) said their houses or apartments had been broken into; \n22 percent (1,540,000) said their cars had been broken into. In all, 42 \npercent (nearly three million New Yorkers)said they had been the victims \nof crime in 1993. And, of course, about 2,000 were murdered. This is what \nit means to say that crime in 1993 was down eight percent. In October of 1994 the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that violent \ncrime had not, after all, declined in 1993 but had risen by 5.6 percent. Several years ago the Department of Justice estimated that 83 percent of \nall Americans would be victims of violent crime at least once in their \nlives. About a quarter would be victims of three or more violent crimes. \nWe are progressing steadily toward the fulfillment of that prediction. A TWENTY-YEAR FRAUD EXPOSED O ur greatest fear is of violence from a nameless, faceless stranger. \nOfficials have always reassured citizens by stating that the great \nmajority of murders, at any rate, are committed by a relative or an \nacquaintance of the victim's; a 1993 Department of Justice report said the \nfigure for 1988 was eight out of ten. Unfortunately, that report described only murders in which the killer was \nknown to prosecutors and an arrest was made. It did not mention that more \nand more killers remain unknown and at liberty after a full police \ninvestigation; every year the police make arrests in a smaller proportion \nof murder cases. In our largest cities the police now make arrests in \nfewer than three out of five murder cases. In other words, two out of \nevery five killers are completely untouched by the law. When a killing is a family tragedy, or takes place between friends or \nacquaintances, the police make an arrest virtually every time. When the \npolice make an arrest, they say that the crime has been \"cleared\"; the \npercentage of crimes for which they make arrests is referred to as the \nclearance rate. Because murder has historically been a matter principally \namong families and friends, the homicide clearance rate in the past was \noften greater than 95 percent, even in the largest cities. As late as 1965 \nthe national homicide clearance rate was 91 percent. However, as crime has \nspread and changed its character over the past generation, clearance rates \nhave steadily dropped. In the past two years the national homicide \nclearance rate averaged 65.5 percent. The rate in the sixty-two largest \ncities is 60.5 percent. In the very largest cities--those with populations \nover a million--the rate is 58.3 percent. The missing killers are almost certainly not family members, friends, or \nneighbors. Rather, they are overwhelmingly strangers to their victims, and \ntheir acts are called \"stranger murders.\" Here is the true arithmetic: The \n40 percent of killings in which city police departments are unable to \nidentify and arrest perpetrators must overwhelmingly be counted as \nstranger murders; let us assume that 90 percent of them are committed by \nkillers unknown to the victims. That number is equivalent to 36 percent of \nthe total of all city murders. We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

The Atlantic Monthly; July 1995; The Crisis of Public Order; Volume 276, \nNo. 1; pages 39-54.\n\nDuring his campaign and since, President Bill Clinton has spoken of a \nsharp decline in the strength of the nation's police forces. In the 1960s \nthe United States as a whole had 3.3 police officers for every violent \ncrime reported per year. In 1993 it had 3.47 violent crimes reported for \nevery police officer. In relation to the amount of violent crime, then, we \nhave less than one tenth the effective police power of thirty years ago; \nor, in another formulation, each police officer today must deal with 11.45 \ntimes as many violent crimes as his predecessor of years gone by. Title I of the 1994 crime bill intends to add 100,000 police officers \nnationally by the year 2000. (Most experts believe that far fewer new \nofficers--perhaps 25,000--will actually be hired. For the purposes of this \nargument, though, let us assume the larger figure.) There are now some \n554,000 officers serving on all state and local police forces; 100,000 \nmore would be an increase of 18.4 percent. Rather than having 3.47 times \nas many violent crimes as police officers, we would have 2.94 times as \nmany; or, each police officer would face not 11.45 times as many violent \ncrimes as his predecessor but 9.7 times as many. All this assumes that the \nnumber of violent crimes will not increase over the next several years; if \nit does, the number of violent crimes relative to police officers will \nagain increase. If we wished to return to the ratio of police officers to violent crimes \nwhich gave many of us peace and security in the 1960s, we would have to \nadd not 100,000 new police officers but about five million . When this \nnumber was mentioned to some Department of Justice staffers recently, they \ngiggled; and it is understandable that the idea of such a national \nmobilization, such tremendous expenditures, should strike them as \nlaughable. However, the American people are already paying out of their \nown pockets for an additional 1.5 million private police officers, to \nprovide, at least in part, the protection that the public police are \nunable to furnish. Private police guard office buildings, shopping malls, apartments. \nBusinesses pay them to patrol certain downtown streets, such as those \naround New York's Grand Central Station and public library. And they \npatrol residential areas. Private patrol cars thread the streets of Los \nAngeles, and more than fifty applications are before the city council to \nclose off streets so as to make those patrols more effective. Across the \ncountry much new housing is being built in gated communities, walled off \nand privately guarded. We are well on the way to having several million \npolice officers, and the next decade will bring us much closer. If current \ntrends continue, however, most of the new officers will be privately paid, \navailable for the protection not of the citizenry as a whole--and \ncertainly not of citizens living in the most violent ghettos and housing \nprojects--but of the commercial and residential enclaves that can afford \nthem. Between these enclaves there will be plenty of room to lose a \ncountry. ONE LONG DESCENDING NIGHT P eople hire police officers because they are afraid--above all of \nviolence. Their fear is occasionally a source of puzzlement and mild \ndisdain in the press, which cannot understand why so many Americans say \nthat crime is the nation's most urgent problem and their own greatest \nfear. Indeed, all through 1993 official agencies claimed that crime was \ndeclining. The FBI said that violent crime in the first six months was \ndown three percent overall, and down eight percent in the Northeast. For crime to be down even eight percent would mean that a precinct that \nhad had a hundred murders in 1992 had ninety-two in 1993. But nobody came \naround on New Year's Day of 1993 to give everyone's memory a rinse, \nobliterating the horrors of the previous year. The effect is not \ndisjunctive but cumulative. By the end of 1993, ninety-two additional \npeople had been murdered. Many people can also remember years before 1992, in large cities and in \nsmall. In 1960, for example, six murders, four rapes, and sixteen \nrobberies were reported in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1990 that city, with \na population 14 percent smaller, had thirty-one murders, 168 rapes, and \n1,784 robberies: robbery increased more than 100 times, or 10,000 percent , \nover thirty years. In this perspective a one-year decrease of seven \npercent would seem less than impressive. New Haven is not unique. In Milwaukee in 1965 there were twenty-seven \nmurders, thirty-three rapes, and 214 robberies, and in 1990, when the city \nwas smaller, there were 165 murders, 598 rapes, and 4,472 robberies: \nrobbery became twenty-one times as frequent in twenty-five years. New York \nCity in 1951 had 244 murders; every year for more than a decade it has had \nnearly 2,000 murders.  We experience the crime wave not as separate \nmoments in time but as one long descending night. A loved one lost echoes \nin the heart for decades. Every working police officer knows the murder \nscene: the shocked family and neighbors, too numb yet to grieve; fear and \ndesolation spreading to the street, the workplace, the school, the home, \ncreating an invisible but indelible network of anguish and loss. We have \nexperienced more than 20,000 such scenes every year for more than a \ndecade, and few of them have been truly forgotten. The memory of a mugging may fade but does not vanish. Nine percent of \nthose responding to a recent poll in New York Newsday said that they had \nbeen mugged or assaulted in the past year. This suggests an annual total \nfor the city of more than 600,000 muggings and assaults (remember also \nthat many people, in poor neighborhoods especially, are assaulted more \nthan once). That would be four times as many robberies and assaults as are \nreported to the police department. The Department of Justice says that not \nthree quarters but only half of all violent crimes go unreported: it may \nbe that many report as having happened \"last year\" an incident from more \nthan a year ago. Nevertheless, these are stunning numbers, especially when some other \ncommon crimes are added in. Eight percent of those polled (implying \n560,000 New Yorkers) said their houses or apartments had been broken into; \n22 percent (1,540,000) said their cars had been broken into. In all, 42 \npercent (nearly three million New Yorkers)said they had been the victims \nof crime in 1993. And, of course, about 2,000 were murdered. This is what \nit means to say that crime in 1993 was down eight percent. In October of 1994 the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that violent \ncrime had not, after all, declined in 1993 but had risen by 5.6 percent. Several years ago the Department of Justice estimated that 83 percent of \nall Americans would be victims of violent crime at least once in their \nlives. About a quarter would be victims of three or more violent crimes. \nWe are progressing steadily toward the fulfillment of that prediction. A TWENTY-YEAR FRAUD EXPOSED O ur greatest fear is of violence from a nameless, faceless stranger. \nOfficials have always reassured citizens by stating that the great \nmajority of murders, at any rate, are committed by a relative or an \nacquaintance of the victim's; a 1993 Department of Justice report said the \nfigure for 1988 was eight out of ten. Unfortunately, that report described only murders in which the killer was \nknown to prosecutors and an arrest was made. It did not mention that more \nand more killers remain unknown and at liberty after a full police \ninvestigation; every year the police make arrests in a smaller proportion \nof murder cases. In our largest cities the police now make arrests in \nfewer than three out of five murder cases. In other words, two out of \nevery five killers are completely untouched by the law. When a killing is a family tragedy, or takes place between friends or \nacquaintances, the police make an arrest virtually every time. When the \npolice make an arrest, they say that the crime has been \"cleared\"; the \npercentage of crimes for which they make arrests is referred to as the \nclearance rate. Because murder has historically been a matter principally \namong families and friends, the homicide clearance rate in the past was \noften greater than 95 percent, even in the largest cities. As late as 1965 \nthe national homicide clearance rate was 91 percent. However, as crime has \nspread and changed its character over the past generation, clearance rates \nhave steadily dropped. In the past two years the national homicide \nclearance rate averaged 65.5 percent. The rate in the sixty-two largest \ncities is 60.5 percent. In the very largest cities--those with populations \nover a million--the rate is 58.3 percent. The missing killers are almost certainly not family members, friends, or \nneighbors. Rather, they are overwhelmingly strangers to their victims, and \ntheir acts are called \"stranger murders.\" Here is the true arithmetic: The \n40 percent of killings in which city police departments are unable to \nidentify and arrest perpetrators must overwhelmingly be counted as \nstranger murders; let us assume that 90 percent of them are committed by \nkillers unknown to the victims. That number is equivalent to 36 percent of \nthe total of all city murders. We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

The Atlantic Monthly; July 1995; The Crisis of Public Order; Volume 276, \nNo. 1; pages 39-54.\n\nTitle I of the 1994 crime bill intends to add 100,000 police officers \nnationally by the year 2000. (Most experts believe that far fewer new \nofficers--perhaps 25,000--will actually be hired. For the purposes of this \nargument, though, let us assume the larger figure.) There are now some \n554,000 officers serving on all state and local police forces; 100,000 \nmore would be an increase of 18.4 percent. Rather than having 3.47 times \nas many violent crimes as police officers, we would have 2.94 times as \nmany; or, each police officer would face not 11.45 times as many violent \ncrimes as his predecessor but 9.7 times as many. All this assumes that the \nnumber of violent crimes will not increase over the next several years; if \nit does, the number of violent crimes relative to police officers will \nagain increase. If we wished to return to the ratio of police officers to violent crimes \nwhich gave many of us peace and security in the 1960s, we would have to \nadd not 100,000 new police officers but about five million . When this \nnumber was mentioned to some Department of Justice staffers recently, they \ngiggled; and it is understandable that the idea of such a national \nmobilization, such tremendous expenditures, should strike them as \nlaughable. However, the American people are already paying out of their \nown pockets for an additional 1.5 million private police officers, to \nprovide, at least in part, the protection that the public police are \nunable to furnish. Private police guard office buildings, shopping malls, apartments. \nBusinesses pay them to patrol certain downtown streets, such as those \naround New York's Grand Central Station and public library. And they \npatrol residential areas. Private patrol cars thread the streets of Los \nAngeles, and more than fifty applications are before the city council to \nclose off streets so as to make those patrols more effective. Across the \ncountry much new housing is being built in gated communities, walled off \nand privately guarded. We are well on the way to having several million \npolice officers, and the next decade will bring us much closer. If current \ntrends continue, however, most of the new officers will be privately paid, \navailable for the protection not of the citizenry as a whole--and \ncertainly not of citizens living in the most violent ghettos and housing \nprojects--but of the commercial and residential enclaves that can afford \nthem. Between these enclaves there will be plenty of room to lose a \ncountry. ONE LONG DESCENDING NIGHT P eople hire police officers because they are afraid--above all of \nviolence. Their fear is occasionally a source of puzzlement and mild \ndisdain in the press, which cannot understand why so many Americans say \nthat crime is the nation's most urgent problem and their own greatest \nfear. Indeed, all through 1993 official agencies claimed that crime was \ndeclining. The FBI said that violent crime in the first six months was \ndown three percent overall, and down eight percent in the Northeast. For crime to be down even eight percent would mean that a precinct that \nhad had a hundred murders in 1992 had ninety-two in 1993. But nobody came \naround on New Year's Day of 1993 to give everyone's memory a rinse, \nobliterating the horrors of the previous year. The effect is not \ndisjunctive but cumulative. By the end of 1993, ninety-two additional \npeople had been murdered. Many people can also remember years before 1992, in large cities and in \nsmall. In 1960, for example, six murders, four rapes, and sixteen \nrobberies were reported in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1990 that city, with \na population 14 percent smaller, had thirty-one murders, 168 rapes, and \n1,784 robberies: robbery increased more than 100 times, or 10,000 percent , \nover thirty years. In this perspective a one-year decrease of seven \npercent would seem less than impressive. New Haven is not unique. In Milwaukee in 1965 there were twenty-seven \nmurders, thirty-three rapes, and 214 robberies, and in 1990, when the city \nwas smaller, there were 165 murders, 598 rapes, and 4,472 robberies: \nrobbery became twenty-one times as frequent in twenty-five years. New York \nCity in 1951 had 244 murders; every year for more than a decade it has had \nnearly 2,000 murders.  We experience the crime wave not as separate \nmoments in time but as one long descending night. A loved one lost echoes \nin the heart for decades. Every working police officer knows the murder \nscene: the shocked family and neighbors, too numb yet to grieve; fear and \ndesolation spreading to the street, the workplace, the school, the home, \ncreating an invisible but indelible network of anguish and loss. We have \nexperienced more than 20,000 such scenes every year for more than a \ndecade, and few of them have been truly forgotten. The memory of a mugging may fade but does not vanish. Nine percent of \nthose responding to a recent poll in New York Newsday said that they had \nbeen mugged or assaulted in the past year. This suggests an annual total \nfor the city of more than 600,000 muggings and assaults (remember also \nthat many people, in poor neighborhoods especially, are assaulted more \nthan once). That would be four times as many robberies and assaults as are \nreported to the police department. The Department of Justice says that not \nthree quarters but only half of all violent crimes go unreported: it may \nbe that many report as having happened \"last year\" an incident from more \nthan a year ago. Nevertheless, these are stunning numbers, especially when some other \ncommon crimes are added in. Eight percent of those polled (implying \n560,000 New Yorkers) said their houses or apartments had been broken into; \n22 percent (1,540,000) said their cars had been broken into. In all, 42 \npercent (nearly three million New Yorkers)said they had been the victims \nof crime in 1993. And, of course, about 2,000 were murdered. This is what \nit means to say that crime in 1993 was down eight percent. In October of 1994 the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that violent \ncrime had not, after all, declined in 1993 but had risen by 5.6 percent. Several years ago the Department of Justice estimated that 83 percent of \nall Americans would be victims of violent crime at least once in their \nlives. About a quarter would be victims of three or more violent crimes. \nWe are progressing steadily toward the fulfillment of that prediction. A TWENTY-YEAR FRAUD EXPOSED O ur greatest fear is of violence from a nameless, faceless stranger. \nOfficials have always reassured citizens by stating that the great \nmajority of murders, at any rate, are committed by a relative or an \nacquaintance of the victim's; a 1993 Department of Justice report said the \nfigure for 1988 was eight out of ten. Unfortunately, that report described only murders in which the killer was \nknown to prosecutors and an arrest was made. It did not mention that more \nand more killers remain unknown and at liberty after a full police \ninvestigation; every year the police make arrests in a smaller proportion \nof murder cases. In our largest cities the police now make arrests in \nfewer than three out of five murder cases. In other words, two out of \nevery five killers are completely untouched by the law. When a killing is a family tragedy, or takes place between friends or \nacquaintances, the police make an arrest virtually every time. When the \npolice make an arrest, they say that the crime has been \"cleared\"; the \npercentage of crimes for which they make arrests is referred to as the \nclearance rate. Because murder has historically been a matter principally \namong families and friends, the homicide clearance rate in the past was \noften greater than 95 percent, even in the largest cities. As late as 1965 \nthe national homicide clearance rate was 91 percent. However, as crime has \nspread and changed its character over the past generation, clearance rates \nhave steadily dropped. In the past two years the national homicide \nclearance rate averaged 65.5 percent. The rate in the sixty-two largest \ncities is 60.5 percent. In the very largest cities--those with populations \nover a million--the rate is 58.3 percent. The missing killers are almost certainly not family members, friends, or \nneighbors. Rather, they are overwhelmingly strangers to their victims, and \ntheir acts are called \"stranger murders.\" Here is the true arithmetic: The \n40 percent of killings in which city police departments are unable to \nidentify and arrest perpetrators must overwhelmingly be counted as \nstranger murders; let us assume that 90 percent of them are committed by \nkillers unknown to the victims. That number is equivalent to 36 percent of \nthe total of all city murders. We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

When this \nnumber was mentioned to some Department of Justice staffers recently, they \ngiggled; and it is understandable that the idea of such a national \nmobilization, such tremendous expenditures, should strike them as \nlaughable. However, the American people are already paying out of their \nown pockets for an additional 1.5 million private police officers, to \nprovide, at least in part, the protection that the public police are \nunable to furnish. Private police guard office buildings, shopping malls, apartments. \nBusinesses pay them to patrol certain downtown streets, such as those \naround New York's Grand Central Station and public library. And they \npatrol residential areas. Private patrol cars thread the streets of Los \nAngeles, and more than fifty applications are before the city council to \nclose off streets so as to make those patrols more effective. Across the \ncountry much new housing is being built in gated communities, walled off \nand privately guarded. We are well on the way to having several million \npolice officers, and the next decade will bring us much closer. If current \ntrends continue, however, most of the new officers will be privately paid, \navailable for the protection not of the citizenry as a whole--and \ncertainly not of citizens living in the most violent ghettos and housing \nprojects--but of the commercial and residential enclaves that can afford \nthem. Between these enclaves there will be plenty of room to lose a \ncountry. ONE LONG DESCENDING NIGHT P eople hire police officers because they are afraid--above all of \nviolence. Their fear is occasionally a source of puzzlement and mild \ndisdain in the press, which cannot understand why so many Americans say \nthat crime is the nation's most urgent problem and their own greatest \nfear. Indeed, all through 1993 official agencies claimed that crime was \ndeclining. The FBI said that violent crime in the first six months was \ndown three percent overall, and down eight percent in the Northeast. For crime to be down even eight percent would mean that a precinct that \nhad had a hundred murders in 1992 had ninety-two in 1993. But nobody came \naround on New Year's Day of 1993 to give everyone's memory a rinse, \nobliterating the horrors of the previous year. The effect is not \ndisjunctive but cumulative. By the end of 1993, ninety-two additional \npeople had been murdered. Many people can also remember years before 1992, in large cities and in \nsmall. In 1960, for example, six murders, four rapes, and sixteen \nrobberies were reported in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1990 that city, with \na population 14 percent smaller, had thirty-one murders, 168 rapes, and \n1,784 robberies: robbery increased more than 100 times, or 10,000 percent , \nover thirty years. In this perspective a one-year decrease of seven \npercent would seem less than impressive. New Haven is not unique. In Milwaukee in 1965 there were twenty-seven \nmurders, thirty-three rapes, and 214 robberies, and in 1990, when the city \nwas smaller, there were 165 murders, 598 rapes, and 4,472 robberies: \nrobbery became twenty-one times as frequent in twenty-five years. New York \nCity in 1951 had 244 murders; every year for more than a decade it has had \nnearly 2,000 murders.  We experience the crime wave not as separate \nmoments in time but as one long descending night. A loved one lost echoes \nin the heart for decades. Every working police officer knows the murder \nscene: the shocked family and neighbors, too numb yet to grieve; fear and \ndesolation spreading to the street, the workplace, the school, the home, \ncreating an invisible but indelible network of anguish and loss. We have \nexperienced more than 20,000 such scenes every year for more than a \ndecade, and few of them have been truly forgotten. The memory of a mugging may fade but does not vanish. Nine percent of \nthose responding to a recent poll in New York Newsday said that they had \nbeen mugged or assaulted in the past year. This suggests an annual total \nfor the city of more than 600,000 muggings and assaults (remember also \nthat many people, in poor neighborhoods especially, are assaulted more \nthan once). That would be four times as many robberies and assaults as are \nreported to the police department. The Department of Justice says that not \nthree quarters but only half of all violent crimes go unreported: it may \nbe that many report as having happened \"last year\" an incident from more \nthan a year ago. Nevertheless, these are stunning numbers, especially when some other \ncommon crimes are added in. Eight percent of those polled (implying \n560,000 New Yorkers) said their houses or apartments had been broken into; \n22 percent (1,540,000) said their cars had been broken into. In all, 42 \npercent (nearly three million New Yorkers)said they had been the victims \nof crime in 1993. And, of course, about 2,000 were murdered. This is what \nit means to say that crime in 1993 was down eight percent. In October of 1994 the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that violent \ncrime had not, after all, declined in 1993 but had risen by 5.6 percent. Several years ago the Department of Justice estimated that 83 percent of \nall Americans would be victims of violent crime at least once in their \nlives. About a quarter would be victims of three or more violent crimes. \nWe are progressing steadily toward the fulfillment of that prediction. A TWENTY-YEAR FRAUD EXPOSED O ur greatest fear is of violence from a nameless, faceless stranger. \nOfficials have always reassured citizens by stating that the great \nmajority of murders, at any rate, are committed by a relative or an \nacquaintance of the victim's; a 1993 Department of Justice report said the \nfigure for 1988 was eight out of ten. Unfortunately, that report described only murders in which the killer was \nknown to prosecutors and an arrest was made. It did not mention that more \nand more killers remain unknown and at liberty after a full police \ninvestigation; every year the police make arrests in a smaller proportion \nof murder cases. In our largest cities the police now make arrests in \nfewer than three out of five murder cases. In other words, two out of \nevery five killers are completely untouched by the law. When a killing is a family tragedy, or takes place between friends or \nacquaintances, the police make an arrest virtually every time. When the \npolice make an arrest, they say that the crime has been \"cleared\"; the \npercentage of crimes for which they make arrests is referred to as the \nclearance rate. Because murder has historically been a matter principally \namong families and friends, the homicide clearance rate in the past was \noften greater than 95 percent, even in the largest cities. As late as 1965 \nthe national homicide clearance rate was 91 percent. However, as crime has \nspread and changed its character over the past generation, clearance rates \nhave steadily dropped. In the past two years the national homicide \nclearance rate averaged 65.5 percent. The rate in the sixty-two largest \ncities is 60.5 percent. In the very largest cities--those with populations \nover a million--the rate is 58.3 percent. The missing killers are almost certainly not family members, friends, or \nneighbors. Rather, they are overwhelmingly strangers to their victims, and \ntheir acts are called \"stranger murders.\" Here is the true arithmetic: The \n40 percent of killings in which city police departments are unable to \nidentify and arrest perpetrators must overwhelmingly be counted as \nstranger murders; let us assume that 90 percent of them are committed by \nkillers unknown to the victims. That number is equivalent to 36 percent of \nthe total of all city murders. We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

And they \npatrol residential areas. Private patrol cars thread the streets of Los \nAngeles, and more than fifty applications are before the city council to \nclose off streets so as to make those patrols more effective. Across the \ncountry much new housing is being built in gated communities, walled off \nand privately guarded. We are well on the way to having several million \npolice officers, and the next decade will bring us much closer. If current \ntrends continue, however, most of the new officers will be privately paid, \navailable for the protection not of the citizenry as a whole--and \ncertainly not of citizens living in the most violent ghettos and housing \nprojects--but of the commercial and residential enclaves that can afford \nthem. Between these enclaves there will be plenty of room to lose a \ncountry. ONE LONG DESCENDING NIGHT P eople hire police officers because they are afraid--above all of \nviolence. Their fear is occasionally a source of puzzlement and mild \ndisdain in the press, which cannot understand why so many Americans say \nthat crime is the nation's most urgent problem and their own greatest \nfear. Indeed, all through 1993 official agencies claimed that crime was \ndeclining. The FBI said that violent crime in the first six months was \ndown three percent overall, and down eight percent in the Northeast. For crime to be down even eight percent would mean that a precinct that \nhad had a hundred murders in 1992 had ninety-two in 1993. But nobody came \naround on New Year's Day of 1993 to give everyone's memory a rinse, \nobliterating the horrors of the previous year. The effect is not \ndisjunctive but cumulative. By the end of 1993, ninety-two additional \npeople had been murdered. Many people can also remember years before 1992, in large cities and in \nsmall. In 1960, for example, six murders, four rapes, and sixteen \nrobberies were reported in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1990 that city, with \na population 14 percent smaller, had thirty-one murders, 168 rapes, and \n1,784 robberies: robbery increased more than 100 times, or 10,000 percent , \nover thirty years. In this perspective a one-year decrease of seven \npercent would seem less than impressive. New Haven is not unique. In Milwaukee in 1965 there were twenty-seven \nmurders, thirty-three rapes, and 214 robberies, and in 1990, when the city \nwas smaller, there were 165 murders, 598 rapes, and 4,472 robberies: \nrobbery became twenty-one times as frequent in twenty-five years. New York \nCity in 1951 had 244 murders; every year for more than a decade it has had \nnearly 2,000 murders.  We experience the crime wave not as separate \nmoments in time but as one long descending night. A loved one lost echoes \nin the heart for decades. Every working police officer knows the murder \nscene: the shocked family and neighbors, too numb yet to grieve; fear and \ndesolation spreading to the street, the workplace, the school, the home, \ncreating an invisible but indelible network of anguish and loss. We have \nexperienced more than 20,000 such scenes every year for more than a \ndecade, and few of them have been truly forgotten. The memory of a mugging may fade but does not vanish. Nine percent of \nthose responding to a recent poll in New York Newsday said that they had \nbeen mugged or assaulted in the past year. This suggests an annual total \nfor the city of more than 600,000 muggings and assaults (remember also \nthat many people, in poor neighborhoods especially, are assaulted more \nthan once). That would be four times as many robberies and assaults as are \nreported to the police department. The Department of Justice says that not \nthree quarters but only half of all violent crimes go unreported: it may \nbe that many report as having happened \"last year\" an incident from more \nthan a year ago. Nevertheless, these are stunning numbers, especially when some other \ncommon crimes are added in. Eight percent of those polled (implying \n560,000 New Yorkers) said their houses or apartments had been broken into; \n22 percent (1,540,000) said their cars had been broken into. In all, 42 \npercent (nearly three million New Yorkers)said they had been the victims \nof crime in 1993. And, of course, about 2,000 were murdered. This is what \nit means to say that crime in 1993 was down eight percent. In October of 1994 the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that violent \ncrime had not, after all, declined in 1993 but had risen by 5.6 percent. Several years ago the Department of Justice estimated that 83 percent of \nall Americans would be victims of violent crime at least once in their \nlives. About a quarter would be victims of three or more violent crimes. \nWe are progressing steadily toward the fulfillment of that prediction. A TWENTY-YEAR FRAUD EXPOSED O ur greatest fear is of violence from a nameless, faceless stranger. \nOfficials have always reassured citizens by stating that the great \nmajority of murders, at any rate, are committed by a relative or an \nacquaintance of the victim's; a 1993 Department of Justice report said the \nfigure for 1988 was eight out of ten. Unfortunately, that report described only murders in which the killer was \nknown to prosecutors and an arrest was made. It did not mention that more \nand more killers remain unknown and at liberty after a full police \ninvestigation; every year the police make arrests in a smaller proportion \nof murder cases. In our largest cities the police now make arrests in \nfewer than three out of five murder cases. In other words, two out of \nevery five killers are completely untouched by the law. When a killing is a family tragedy, or takes place between friends or \nacquaintances, the police make an arrest virtually every time. When the \npolice make an arrest, they say that the crime has been \"cleared\"; the \npercentage of crimes for which they make arrests is referred to as the \nclearance rate. Because murder has historically been a matter principally \namong families and friends, the homicide clearance rate in the past was \noften greater than 95 percent, even in the largest cities. As late as 1965 \nthe national homicide clearance rate was 91 percent. However, as crime has \nspread and changed its character over the past generation, clearance rates \nhave steadily dropped. In the past two years the national homicide \nclearance rate averaged 65.5 percent. The rate in the sixty-two largest \ncities is 60.5 percent. In the very largest cities--those with populations \nover a million--the rate is 58.3 percent. The missing killers are almost certainly not family members, friends, or \nneighbors. Rather, they are overwhelmingly strangers to their victims, and \ntheir acts are called \"stranger murders.\" Here is the true arithmetic: The \n40 percent of killings in which city police departments are unable to \nidentify and arrest perpetrators must overwhelmingly be counted as \nstranger murders; let us assume that 90 percent of them are committed by \nkillers unknown to the victims. That number is equivalent to 36 percent of \nthe total of all city murders. We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

Their fear is occasionally a source of puzzlement and mild \ndisdain in the press, which cannot understand why so many Americans say \nthat crime is the nation's most urgent problem and their own greatest \nfear. Indeed, all through 1993 official agencies claimed that crime was \ndeclining. The FBI said that violent crime in the first six months was \ndown three percent overall, and down eight percent in the Northeast. For crime to be down even eight percent would mean that a precinct that \nhad had a hundred murders in 1992 had ninety-two in 1993. But nobody came \naround on New Year's Day of 1993 to give everyone's memory a rinse, \nobliterating the horrors of the previous year. The effect is not \ndisjunctive but cumulative. By the end of 1993, ninety-two additional \npeople had been murdered. Many people can also remember years before 1992, in large cities and in \nsmall. In 1960, for example, six murders, four rapes, and sixteen \nrobberies were reported in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1990 that city, with \na population 14 percent smaller, had thirty-one murders, 168 rapes, and \n1,784 robberies: robbery increased more than 100 times, or 10,000 percent , \nover thirty years. In this perspective a one-year decrease of seven \npercent would seem less than impressive. New Haven is not unique. In Milwaukee in 1965 there were twenty-seven \nmurders, thirty-three rapes, and 214 robberies, and in 1990, when the city \nwas smaller, there were 165 murders, 598 rapes, and 4,472 robberies: \nrobbery became twenty-one times as frequent in twenty-five years. New York \nCity in 1951 had 244 murders; every year for more than a decade it has had \nnearly 2,000 murders.  We experience the crime wave not as separate \nmoments in time but as one long descending night. A loved one lost echoes \nin the heart for decades. Every working police officer knows the murder \nscene: the shocked family and neighbors, too numb yet to grieve; fear and \ndesolation spreading to the street, the workplace, the school, the home, \ncreating an invisible but indelible network of anguish and loss. We have \nexperienced more than 20,000 such scenes every year for more than a \ndecade, and few of them have been truly forgotten. The memory of a mugging may fade but does not vanish. Nine percent of \nthose responding to a recent poll in New York Newsday said that they had \nbeen mugged or assaulted in the past year. This suggests an annual total \nfor the city of more than 600,000 muggings and assaults (remember also \nthat many people, in poor neighborhoods especially, are assaulted more \nthan once). That would be four times as many robberies and assaults as are \nreported to the police department. The Department of Justice says that not \nthree quarters but only half of all violent crimes go unreported: it may \nbe that many report as having happened \"last year\" an incident from more \nthan a year ago. Nevertheless, these are stunning numbers, especially when some other \ncommon crimes are added in. Eight percent of those polled (implying \n560,000 New Yorkers) said their houses or apartments had been broken into; \n22 percent (1,540,000) said their cars had been broken into. In all, 42 \npercent (nearly three million New Yorkers)said they had been the victims \nof crime in 1993. And, of course, about 2,000 were murdered. This is what \nit means to say that crime in 1993 was down eight percent. In October of 1994 the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that violent \ncrime had not, after all, declined in 1993 but had risen by 5.6 percent. Several years ago the Department of Justice estimated that 83 percent of \nall Americans would be victims of violent crime at least once in their \nlives. About a quarter would be victims of three or more violent crimes. \nWe are progressing steadily toward the fulfillment of that prediction. A TWENTY-YEAR FRAUD EXPOSED O ur greatest fear is of violence from a nameless, faceless stranger. \nOfficials have always reassured citizens by stating that the great \nmajority of murders, at any rate, are committed by a relative or an \nacquaintance of the victim's; a 1993 Department of Justice report said the \nfigure for 1988 was eight out of ten. Unfortunately, that report described only murders in which the killer was \nknown to prosecutors and an arrest was made. It did not mention that more \nand more killers remain unknown and at liberty after a full police \ninvestigation; every year the police make arrests in a smaller proportion \nof murder cases. In our largest cities the police now make arrests in \nfewer than three out of five murder cases. In other words, two out of \nevery five killers are completely untouched by the law. When a killing is a family tragedy, or takes place between friends or \nacquaintances, the police make an arrest virtually every time. When the \npolice make an arrest, they say that the crime has been \"cleared\"; the \npercentage of crimes for which they make arrests is referred to as the \nclearance rate. Because murder has historically been a matter principally \namong families and friends, the homicide clearance rate in the past was \noften greater than 95 percent, even in the largest cities. As late as 1965 \nthe national homicide clearance rate was 91 percent. However, as crime has \nspread and changed its character over the past generation, clearance rates \nhave steadily dropped. In the past two years the national homicide \nclearance rate averaged 65.5 percent. The rate in the sixty-two largest \ncities is 60.5 percent. In the very largest cities--those with populations \nover a million--the rate is 58.3 percent. The missing killers are almost certainly not family members, friends, or \nneighbors. Rather, they are overwhelmingly strangers to their victims, and \ntheir acts are called \"stranger murders.\" Here is the true arithmetic: The \n40 percent of killings in which city police departments are unable to \nidentify and arrest perpetrators must overwhelmingly be counted as \nstranger murders; let us assume that 90 percent of them are committed by \nkillers unknown to the victims. That number is equivalent to 36 percent of \nthe total of all city murders. We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

The Atlantic Monthly; July 1995; The Crisis of Public Order; Volume 276, \nNo. 1; pages 39-54.\n\nP eople hire police officers because they are afraid--above all of \nviolence. Their fear is occasionally a source of puzzlement and mild \ndisdain in the press, which cannot understand why so many Americans say \nthat crime is the nation's most urgent problem and their own greatest \nfear. Indeed, all through 1993 official agencies claimed that crime was \ndeclining. The FBI said that violent crime in the first six months was \ndown three percent overall, and down eight percent in the Northeast. For crime to be down even eight percent would mean that a precinct that \nhad had a hundred murders in 1992 had ninety-two in 1993. But nobody came \naround on New Year's Day of 1993 to give everyone's memory a rinse, \nobliterating the horrors of the previous year. The effect is not \ndisjunctive but cumulative. By the end of 1993, ninety-two additional \npeople had been murdered. Many people can also remember years before 1992, in large cities and in \nsmall. In 1960, for example, six murders, four rapes, and sixteen \nrobberies were reported in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1990 that city, with \na population 14 percent smaller, had thirty-one murders, 168 rapes, and \n1,784 robberies: robbery increased more than 100 times, or 10,000 percent , \nover thirty years. In this perspective a one-year decrease of seven \npercent would seem less than impressive. New Haven is not unique. In Milwaukee in 1965 there were twenty-seven \nmurders, thirty-three rapes, and 214 robberies, and in 1990, when the city \nwas smaller, there were 165 murders, 598 rapes, and 4,472 robberies: \nrobbery became twenty-one times as frequent in twenty-five years. New York \nCity in 1951 had 244 murders; every year for more than a decade it has had \nnearly 2,000 murders.  We experience the crime wave not as separate \nmoments in time but as one long descending night. A loved one lost echoes \nin the heart for decades. Every working police officer knows the murder \nscene: the shocked family and neighbors, too numb yet to grieve; fear and \ndesolation spreading to the street, the workplace, the school, the home, \ncreating an invisible but indelible network of anguish and loss. We have \nexperienced more than 20,000 such scenes every year for more than a \ndecade, and few of them have been truly forgotten. The memory of a mugging may fade but does not vanish. Nine percent of \nthose responding to a recent poll in New York Newsday said that they had \nbeen mugged or assaulted in the past year. This suggests an annual total \nfor the city of more than 600,000 muggings and assaults (remember also \nthat many people, in poor neighborhoods especially, are assaulted more \nthan once). That would be four times as many robberies and assaults as are \nreported to the police department. The Department of Justice says that not \nthree quarters but only half of all violent crimes go unreported: it may \nbe that many report as having happened \"last year\" an incident from more \nthan a year ago. Nevertheless, these are stunning numbers, especially when some other \ncommon crimes are added in. Eight percent of those polled (implying \n560,000 New Yorkers) said their houses or apartments had been broken into; \n22 percent (1,540,000) said their cars had been broken into. In all, 42 \npercent (nearly three million New Yorkers)said they had been the victims \nof crime in 1993. And, of course, about 2,000 were murdered. This is what \nit means to say that crime in 1993 was down eight percent. In October of 1994 the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that violent \ncrime had not, after all, declined in 1993 but had risen by 5.6 percent. Several years ago the Department of Justice estimated that 83 percent of \nall Americans would be victims of violent crime at least once in their \nlives. About a quarter would be victims of three or more violent crimes. \nWe are progressing steadily toward the fulfillment of that prediction. A TWENTY-YEAR FRAUD EXPOSED O ur greatest fear is of violence from a nameless, faceless stranger. \nOfficials have always reassured citizens by stating that the great \nmajority of murders, at any rate, are committed by a relative or an \nacquaintance of the victim's; a 1993 Department of Justice report said the \nfigure for 1988 was eight out of ten. Unfortunately, that report described only murders in which the killer was \nknown to prosecutors and an arrest was made. It did not mention that more \nand more killers remain unknown and at liberty after a full police \ninvestigation; every year the police make arrests in a smaller proportion \nof murder cases. In our largest cities the police now make arrests in \nfewer than three out of five murder cases. In other words, two out of \nevery five killers are completely untouched by the law. When a killing is a family tragedy, or takes place between friends or \nacquaintances, the police make an arrest virtually every time. When the \npolice make an arrest, they say that the crime has been \"cleared\"; the \npercentage of crimes for which they make arrests is referred to as the \nclearance rate. Because murder has historically been a matter principally \namong families and friends, the homicide clearance rate in the past was \noften greater than 95 percent, even in the largest cities. As late as 1965 \nthe national homicide clearance rate was 91 percent. However, as crime has \nspread and changed its character over the past generation, clearance rates \nhave steadily dropped. In the past two years the national homicide \nclearance rate averaged 65.5 percent. The rate in the sixty-two largest \ncities is 60.5 percent. In the very largest cities--those with populations \nover a million--the rate is 58.3 percent. The missing killers are almost certainly not family members, friends, or \nneighbors. Rather, they are overwhelmingly strangers to their victims, and \ntheir acts are called \"stranger murders.\" Here is the true arithmetic: The \n40 percent of killings in which city police departments are unable to \nidentify and arrest perpetrators must overwhelmingly be counted as \nstranger murders; let us assume that 90 percent of them are committed by \nkillers unknown to the victims. That number is equivalent to 36 percent of \nthe total of all city murders. We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

But nobody came \naround on New Year's Day of 1993 to give everyone's memory a rinse, \nobliterating the horrors of the previous year. The effect is not \ndisjunctive but cumulative. By the end of 1993, ninety-two additional \npeople had been murdered. Many people can also remember years before 1992, in large cities and in \nsmall. In 1960, for example, six murders, four rapes, and sixteen \nrobberies were reported in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1990 that city, with \na population 14 percent smaller, had thirty-one murders, 168 rapes, and \n1,784 robberies: robbery increased more than 100 times, or 10,000 percent , \nover thirty years. In this perspective a one-year decrease of seven \npercent would seem less than impressive. New Haven is not unique. In Milwaukee in 1965 there were twenty-seven \nmurders, thirty-three rapes, and 214 robberies, and in 1990, when the city \nwas smaller, there were 165 murders, 598 rapes, and 4,472 robberies: \nrobbery became twenty-one times as frequent in twenty-five years. New York \nCity in 1951 had 244 murders; every year for more than a decade it has had \nnearly 2,000 murders.  We experience the crime wave not as separate \nmoments in time but as one long descending night. A loved one lost echoes \nin the heart for decades. Every working police officer knows the murder \nscene: the shocked family and neighbors, too numb yet to grieve; fear and \ndesolation spreading to the street, the workplace, the school, the home, \ncreating an invisible but indelible network of anguish and loss. We have \nexperienced more than 20,000 such scenes every year for more than a \ndecade, and few of them have been truly forgotten. The memory of a mugging may fade but does not vanish. Nine percent of \nthose responding to a recent poll in New York Newsday said that they had \nbeen mugged or assaulted in the past year. This suggests an annual total \nfor the city of more than 600,000 muggings and assaults (remember also \nthat many people, in poor neighborhoods especially, are assaulted more \nthan once). That would be four times as many robberies and assaults as are \nreported to the police department. The Department of Justice says that not \nthree quarters but only half of all violent crimes go unreported: it may \nbe that many report as having happened \"last year\" an incident from more \nthan a year ago. Nevertheless, these are stunning numbers, especially when some other \ncommon crimes are added in. Eight percent of those polled (implying \n560,000 New Yorkers) said their houses or apartments had been broken into; \n22 percent (1,540,000) said their cars had been broken into. In all, 42 \npercent (nearly three million New Yorkers)said they had been the victims \nof crime in 1993. And, of course, about 2,000 were murdered. This is what \nit means to say that crime in 1993 was down eight percent. In October of 1994 the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that violent \ncrime had not, after all, declined in 1993 but had risen by 5.6 percent. Several years ago the Department of Justice estimated that 83 percent of \nall Americans would be victims of violent crime at least once in their \nlives. About a quarter would be victims of three or more violent crimes. \nWe are progressing steadily toward the fulfillment of that prediction. A TWENTY-YEAR FRAUD EXPOSED O ur greatest fear is of violence from a nameless, faceless stranger. \nOfficials have always reassured citizens by stating that the great \nmajority of murders, at any rate, are committed by a relative or an \nacquaintance of the victim's; a 1993 Department of Justice report said the \nfigure for 1988 was eight out of ten. Unfortunately, that report described only murders in which the killer was \nknown to prosecutors and an arrest was made. It did not mention that more \nand more killers remain unknown and at liberty after a full police \ninvestigation; every year the police make arrests in a smaller proportion \nof murder cases. In our largest cities the police now make arrests in \nfewer than three out of five murder cases. In other words, two out of \nevery five killers are completely untouched by the law. When a killing is a family tragedy, or takes place between friends or \nacquaintances, the police make an arrest virtually every time. When the \npolice make an arrest, they say that the crime has been \"cleared\"; the \npercentage of crimes for which they make arrests is referred to as the \nclearance rate. Because murder has historically been a matter principally \namong families and friends, the homicide clearance rate in the past was \noften greater than 95 percent, even in the largest cities. As late as 1965 \nthe national homicide clearance rate was 91 percent. However, as crime has \nspread and changed its character over the past generation, clearance rates \nhave steadily dropped. In the past two years the national homicide \nclearance rate averaged 65.5 percent. The rate in the sixty-two largest \ncities is 60.5 percent. In the very largest cities--those with populations \nover a million--the rate is 58.3 percent. The missing killers are almost certainly not family members, friends, or \nneighbors. Rather, they are overwhelmingly strangers to their victims, and \ntheir acts are called \"stranger murders.\" Here is the true arithmetic: The \n40 percent of killings in which city police departments are unable to \nidentify and arrest perpetrators must overwhelmingly be counted as \nstranger murders; let us assume that 90 percent of them are committed by \nkillers unknown to the victims. That number is equivalent to 36 percent of \nthe total of all city murders. We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

In 1960, for example, six murders, four rapes, and sixteen \nrobberies were reported in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1990 that city, with \na population 14 percent smaller, had thirty-one murders, 168 rapes, and \n1,784 robberies: robbery increased more than 100 times, or 10,000 percent , \nover thirty years. In this perspective a one-year decrease of seven \npercent would seem less than impressive. New Haven is not unique. In Milwaukee in 1965 there were twenty-seven \nmurders, thirty-three rapes, and 214 robberies, and in 1990, when the city \nwas smaller, there were 165 murders, 598 rapes, and 4,472 robberies: \nrobbery became twenty-one times as frequent in twenty-five years. New York \nCity in 1951 had 244 murders; every year for more than a decade it has had \nnearly 2,000 murders.  We experience the crime wave not as separate \nmoments in time but as one long descending night. A loved one lost echoes \nin the heart for decades. Every working police officer knows the murder \nscene: the shocked family and neighbors, too numb yet to grieve; fear and \ndesolation spreading to the street, the workplace, the school, the home, \ncreating an invisible but indelible network of anguish and loss. We have \nexperienced more than 20,000 such scenes every year for more than a \ndecade, and few of them have been truly forgotten. The memory of a mugging may fade but does not vanish. Nine percent of \nthose responding to a recent poll in New York Newsday said that they had \nbeen mugged or assaulted in the past year. This suggests an annual total \nfor the city of more than 600,000 muggings and assaults (remember also \nthat many people, in poor neighborhoods especially, are assaulted more \nthan once). That would be four times as many robberies and assaults as are \nreported to the police department. The Department of Justice says that not \nthree quarters but only half of all violent crimes go unreported: it may \nbe that many report as having happened \"last year\" an incident from more \nthan a year ago. Nevertheless, these are stunning numbers, especially when some other \ncommon crimes are added in. Eight percent of those polled (implying \n560,000 New Yorkers) said their houses or apartments had been broken into; \n22 percent (1,540,000) said their cars had been broken into. In all, 42 \npercent (nearly three million New Yorkers)said they had been the victims \nof crime in 1993. And, of course, about 2,000 were murdered. This is what \nit means to say that crime in 1993 was down eight percent. In October of 1994 the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that violent \ncrime had not, after all, declined in 1993 but had risen by 5.6 percent. Several years ago the Department of Justice estimated that 83 percent of \nall Americans would be victims of violent crime at least once in their \nlives. About a quarter would be victims of three or more violent crimes. \nWe are progressing steadily toward the fulfillment of that prediction. A TWENTY-YEAR FRAUD EXPOSED O ur greatest fear is of violence from a nameless, faceless stranger. \nOfficials have always reassured citizens by stating that the great \nmajority of murders, at any rate, are committed by a relative or an \nacquaintance of the victim's; a 1993 Department of Justice report said the \nfigure for 1988 was eight out of ten. Unfortunately, that report described only murders in which the killer was \nknown to prosecutors and an arrest was made. It did not mention that more \nand more killers remain unknown and at liberty after a full police \ninvestigation; every year the police make arrests in a smaller proportion \nof murder cases. In our largest cities the police now make arrests in \nfewer than three out of five murder cases. In other words, two out of \nevery five killers are completely untouched by the law. When a killing is a family tragedy, or takes place between friends or \nacquaintances, the police make an arrest virtually every time. When the \npolice make an arrest, they say that the crime has been \"cleared\"; the \npercentage of crimes for which they make arrests is referred to as the \nclearance rate. Because murder has historically been a matter principally \namong families and friends, the homicide clearance rate in the past was \noften greater than 95 percent, even in the largest cities. As late as 1965 \nthe national homicide clearance rate was 91 percent. However, as crime has \nspread and changed its character over the past generation, clearance rates \nhave steadily dropped. In the past two years the national homicide \nclearance rate averaged 65.5 percent. The rate in the sixty-two largest \ncities is 60.5 percent. In the very largest cities--those with populations \nover a million--the rate is 58.3 percent. The missing killers are almost certainly not family members, friends, or \nneighbors. Rather, they are overwhelmingly strangers to their victims, and \ntheir acts are called \"stranger murders.\" Here is the true arithmetic: The \n40 percent of killings in which city police departments are unable to \nidentify and arrest perpetrators must overwhelmingly be counted as \nstranger murders; let us assume that 90 percent of them are committed by \nkillers unknown to the victims. That number is equivalent to 36 percent of \nthe total of all city murders. We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

In Milwaukee in 1965 there were twenty-seven \nmurders, thirty-three rapes, and 214 robberies, and in 1990, when the city \nwas smaller, there were 165 murders, 598 rapes, and 4,472 robberies: \nrobbery became twenty-one times as frequent in twenty-five years. New York \nCity in 1951 had 244 murders; every year for more than a decade it has had \nnearly 2,000 murders.  We experience the crime wave not as separate \nmoments in time but as one long descending night. A loved one lost echoes \nin the heart for decades. Every working police officer knows the murder \nscene: the shocked family and neighbors, too numb yet to grieve; fear and \ndesolation spreading to the street, the workplace, the school, the home, \ncreating an invisible but indelible network of anguish and loss. We have \nexperienced more than 20,000 such scenes every year for more than a \ndecade, and few of them have been truly forgotten. The memory of a mugging may fade but does not vanish. Nine percent of \nthose responding to a recent poll in New York Newsday said that they had \nbeen mugged or assaulted in the past year. This suggests an annual total \nfor the city of more than 600,000 muggings and assaults (remember also \nthat many people, in poor neighborhoods especially, are assaulted more \nthan once). That would be four times as many robberies and assaults as are \nreported to the police department. The Department of Justice says that not \nthree quarters but only half of all violent crimes go unreported: it may \nbe that many report as having happened \"last year\" an incident from more \nthan a year ago. Nevertheless, these are stunning numbers, especially when some other \ncommon crimes are added in. Eight percent of those polled (implying \n560,000 New Yorkers) said their houses or apartments had been broken into; \n22 percent (1,540,000) said their cars had been broken into. In all, 42 \npercent (nearly three million New Yorkers)said they had been the victims \nof crime in 1993. And, of course, about 2,000 were murdered. This is what \nit means to say that crime in 1993 was down eight percent. In October of 1994 the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that violent \ncrime had not, after all, declined in 1993 but had risen by 5.6 percent. Several years ago the Department of Justice estimated that 83 percent of \nall Americans would be victims of violent crime at least once in their \nlives. About a quarter would be victims of three or more violent crimes. \nWe are progressing steadily toward the fulfillment of that prediction. A TWENTY-YEAR FRAUD EXPOSED O ur greatest fear is of violence from a nameless, faceless stranger. \nOfficials have always reassured citizens by stating that the great \nmajority of murders, at any rate, are committed by a relative or an \nacquaintance of the victim's; a 1993 Department of Justice report said the \nfigure for 1988 was eight out of ten. Unfortunately, that report described only murders in which the killer was \nknown to prosecutors and an arrest was made. It did not mention that more \nand more killers remain unknown and at liberty after a full police \ninvestigation; every year the police make arrests in a smaller proportion \nof murder cases. In our largest cities the police now make arrests in \nfewer than three out of five murder cases. In other words, two out of \nevery five killers are completely untouched by the law. When a killing is a family tragedy, or takes place between friends or \nacquaintances, the police make an arrest virtually every time. When the \npolice make an arrest, they say that the crime has been \"cleared\"; the \npercentage of crimes for which they make arrests is referred to as the \nclearance rate. Because murder has historically been a matter principally \namong families and friends, the homicide clearance rate in the past was \noften greater than 95 percent, even in the largest cities. As late as 1965 \nthe national homicide clearance rate was 91 percent. However, as crime has \nspread and changed its character over the past generation, clearance rates \nhave steadily dropped. In the past two years the national homicide \nclearance rate averaged 65.5 percent. The rate in the sixty-two largest \ncities is 60.5 percent. In the very largest cities--those with populations \nover a million--the rate is 58.3 percent. The missing killers are almost certainly not family members, friends, or \nneighbors. Rather, they are overwhelmingly strangers to their victims, and \ntheir acts are called \"stranger murders.\" Here is the true arithmetic: The \n40 percent of killings in which city police departments are unable to \nidentify and arrest perpetrators must overwhelmingly be counted as \nstranger murders; let us assume that 90 percent of them are committed by \nkillers unknown to the victims. That number is equivalent to 36 percent of \nthe total of all city murders. We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

Nine percent of \nthose responding to a recent poll in New York Newsday said that they had \nbeen mugged or assaulted in the past year. This suggests an annual total \nfor the city of more than 600,000 muggings and assaults (remember also \nthat many people, in poor neighborhoods especially, are assaulted more \nthan once). That would be four times as many robberies and assaults as are \nreported to the police department. The Department of Justice says that not \nthree quarters but only half of all violent crimes go unreported: it may \nbe that many report as having happened \"last year\" an incident from more \nthan a year ago. Nevertheless, these are stunning numbers, especially when some other \ncommon crimes are added in. Eight percent of those polled (implying \n560,000 New Yorkers) said their houses or apartments had been broken into; \n22 percent (1,540,000) said their cars had been broken into. In all, 42 \npercent (nearly three million New Yorkers)said they had been the victims \nof crime in 1993. And, of course, about 2,000 were murdered. This is what \nit means to say that crime in 1993 was down eight percent. In October of 1994 the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that violent \ncrime had not, after all, declined in 1993 but had risen by 5.6 percent. Several years ago the Department of Justice estimated that 83 percent of \nall Americans would be victims of violent crime at least once in their \nlives. About a quarter would be victims of three or more violent crimes. \nWe are progressing steadily toward the fulfillment of that prediction. A TWENTY-YEAR FRAUD EXPOSED O ur greatest fear is of violence from a nameless, faceless stranger. \nOfficials have always reassured citizens by stating that the great \nmajority of murders, at any rate, are committed by a relative or an \nacquaintance of the victim's; a 1993 Department of Justice report said the \nfigure for 1988 was eight out of ten. Unfortunately, that report described only murders in which the killer was \nknown to prosecutors and an arrest was made. It did not mention that more \nand more killers remain unknown and at liberty after a full police \ninvestigation; every year the police make arrests in a smaller proportion \nof murder cases. In our largest cities the police now make arrests in \nfewer than three out of five murder cases. In other words, two out of \nevery five killers are completely untouched by the law. When a killing is a family tragedy, or takes place between friends or \nacquaintances, the police make an arrest virtually every time. When the \npolice make an arrest, they say that the crime has been \"cleared\"; the \npercentage of crimes for which they make arrests is referred to as the \nclearance rate. Because murder has historically been a matter principally \namong families and friends, the homicide clearance rate in the past was \noften greater than 95 percent, even in the largest cities. As late as 1965 \nthe national homicide clearance rate was 91 percent. However, as crime has \nspread and changed its character over the past generation, clearance rates \nhave steadily dropped. In the past two years the national homicide \nclearance rate averaged 65.5 percent. The rate in the sixty-two largest \ncities is 60.5 percent. In the very largest cities--those with populations \nover a million--the rate is 58.3 percent. The missing killers are almost certainly not family members, friends, or \nneighbors. Rather, they are overwhelmingly strangers to their victims, and \ntheir acts are called \"stranger murders.\" Here is the true arithmetic: The \n40 percent of killings in which city police departments are unable to \nidentify and arrest perpetrators must overwhelmingly be counted as \nstranger murders; let us assume that 90 percent of them are committed by \nkillers unknown to the victims. That number is equivalent to 36 percent of \nthe total of all city murders. We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

The Atlantic Monthly; July 1995; The Crisis of Public Order; Volume 276, \nNo. 1; pages 39-54.\n\nNevertheless, these are stunning numbers, especially when some other \ncommon crimes are added in. Eight percent of those polled (implying \n560,000 New Yorkers) said their houses or apartments had been broken into; \n22 percent (1,540,000) said their cars had been broken into. In all, 42 \npercent (nearly three million New Yorkers)said they had been the victims \nof crime in 1993. And, of course, about 2,000 were murdered. This is what \nit means to say that crime in 1993 was down eight percent. In October of 1994 the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that violent \ncrime had not, after all, declined in 1993 but had risen by 5.6 percent. Several years ago the Department of Justice estimated that 83 percent of \nall Americans would be victims of violent crime at least once in their \nlives. About a quarter would be victims of three or more violent crimes. \nWe are progressing steadily toward the fulfillment of that prediction. A TWENTY-YEAR FRAUD EXPOSED O ur greatest fear is of violence from a nameless, faceless stranger. \nOfficials have always reassured citizens by stating that the great \nmajority of murders, at any rate, are committed by a relative or an \nacquaintance of the victim's; a 1993 Department of Justice report said the \nfigure for 1988 was eight out of ten. Unfortunately, that report described only murders in which the killer was \nknown to prosecutors and an arrest was made. It did not mention that more \nand more killers remain unknown and at liberty after a full police \ninvestigation; every year the police make arrests in a smaller proportion \nof murder cases. In our largest cities the police now make arrests in \nfewer than three out of five murder cases. In other words, two out of \nevery five killers are completely untouched by the law. When a killing is a family tragedy, or takes place between friends or \nacquaintances, the police make an arrest virtually every time. When the \npolice make an arrest, they say that the crime has been \"cleared\"; the \npercentage of crimes for which they make arrests is referred to as the \nclearance rate. Because murder has historically been a matter principally \namong families and friends, the homicide clearance rate in the past was \noften greater than 95 percent, even in the largest cities. As late as 1965 \nthe national homicide clearance rate was 91 percent. However, as crime has \nspread and changed its character over the past generation, clearance rates \nhave steadily dropped. In the past two years the national homicide \nclearance rate averaged 65.5 percent. The rate in the sixty-two largest \ncities is 60.5 percent. In the very largest cities--those with populations \nover a million--the rate is 58.3 percent. The missing killers are almost certainly not family members, friends, or \nneighbors. Rather, they are overwhelmingly strangers to their victims, and \ntheir acts are called \"stranger murders.\" Here is the true arithmetic: The \n40 percent of killings in which city police departments are unable to \nidentify and arrest perpetrators must overwhelmingly be counted as \nstranger murders; let us assume that 90 percent of them are committed by \nkillers unknown to the victims. That number is equivalent to 36 percent of \nthe total of all city murders. We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

The Atlantic Monthly; July 1995; The Crisis of Public Order; Volume 276, \nNo. 1; pages 39-54.\n\nIn October of 1994 the Bureau of Justice Statistics reported that violent \ncrime had not, after all, declined in 1993 but had risen by 5.6 percent. Several years ago the Department of Justice estimated that 83 percent of \nall Americans would be victims of violent crime at least once in their \nlives. About a quarter would be victims of three or more violent crimes. \nWe are progressing steadily toward the fulfillment of that prediction. A TWENTY-YEAR FRAUD EXPOSED O ur greatest fear is of violence from a nameless, faceless stranger. \nOfficials have always reassured citizens by stating that the great \nmajority of murders, at any rate, are committed by a relative or an \nacquaintance of the victim's; a 1993 Department of Justice report said the \nfigure for 1988 was eight out of ten. Unfortunately, that report described only murders in which the killer was \nknown to prosecutors and an arrest was made. It did not mention that more \nand more killers remain unknown and at liberty after a full police \ninvestigation; every year the police make arrests in a smaller proportion \nof murder cases. In our largest cities the police now make arrests in \nfewer than three out of five murder cases. In other words, two out of \nevery five killers are completely untouched by the law. When a killing is a family tragedy, or takes place between friends or \nacquaintances, the police make an arrest virtually every time. When the \npolice make an arrest, they say that the crime has been \"cleared\"; the \npercentage of crimes for which they make arrests is referred to as the \nclearance rate. Because murder has historically been a matter principally \namong families and friends, the homicide clearance rate in the past was \noften greater than 95 percent, even in the largest cities. As late as 1965 \nthe national homicide clearance rate was 91 percent. However, as crime has \nspread and changed its character over the past generation, clearance rates \nhave steadily dropped. In the past two years the national homicide \nclearance rate averaged 65.5 percent. The rate in the sixty-two largest \ncities is 60.5 percent. In the very largest cities--those with populations \nover a million--the rate is 58.3 percent. The missing killers are almost certainly not family members, friends, or \nneighbors. Rather, they are overwhelmingly strangers to their victims, and \ntheir acts are called \"stranger murders.\" Here is the true arithmetic: The \n40 percent of killings in which city police departments are unable to \nidentify and arrest perpetrators must overwhelmingly be counted as \nstranger murders; let us assume that 90 percent of them are committed by \nkillers unknown to the victims. That number is equivalent to 36 percent of \nthe total of all city murders. We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

The Atlantic Monthly; July 1995; The Crisis of Public Order; Volume 276, \nNo. 1; pages 39-54.\n\nSeveral years ago the Department of Justice estimated that 83 percent of \nall Americans would be victims of violent crime at least once in their \nlives. About a quarter would be victims of three or more violent crimes. \nWe are progressing steadily toward the fulfillment of that prediction. A TWENTY-YEAR FRAUD EXPOSED O ur greatest fear is of violence from a nameless, faceless stranger. \nOfficials have always reassured citizens by stating that the great \nmajority of murders, at any rate, are committed by a relative or an \nacquaintance of the victim's; a 1993 Department of Justice report said the \nfigure for 1988 was eight out of ten. Unfortunately, that report described only murders in which the killer was \nknown to prosecutors and an arrest was made. It did not mention that more \nand more killers remain unknown and at liberty after a full police \ninvestigation; every year the police make arrests in a smaller proportion \nof murder cases. In our largest cities the police now make arrests in \nfewer than three out of five murder cases. In other words, two out of \nevery five killers are completely untouched by the law. When a killing is a family tragedy, or takes place between friends or \nacquaintances, the police make an arrest virtually every time. When the \npolice make an arrest, they say that the crime has been \"cleared\"; the \npercentage of crimes for which they make arrests is referred to as the \nclearance rate. Because murder has historically been a matter principally \namong families and friends, the homicide clearance rate in the past was \noften greater than 95 percent, even in the largest cities. As late as 1965 \nthe national homicide clearance rate was 91 percent. However, as crime has \nspread and changed its character over the past generation, clearance rates \nhave steadily dropped. In the past two years the national homicide \nclearance rate averaged 65.5 percent. The rate in the sixty-two largest \ncities is 60.5 percent. In the very largest cities--those with populations \nover a million--the rate is 58.3 percent. The missing killers are almost certainly not family members, friends, or \nneighbors. Rather, they are overwhelmingly strangers to their victims, and \ntheir acts are called \"stranger murders.\" Here is the true arithmetic: The \n40 percent of killings in which city police departments are unable to \nidentify and arrest perpetrators must overwhelmingly be counted as \nstranger murders; let us assume that 90 percent of them are committed by \nkillers unknown to the victims. That number is equivalent to 36 percent of \nthe total of all city murders. We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival.

Unfortunately, that report described only murders in which the killer was \nknown to prosecutors and an arrest was made. It did not mention that more \nand more killers remain unknown and at liberty after a full police \ninvestigation; every year the police make arrests in a smaller proportion \nof murder cases. In our largest cities the police now make arrests in \nfewer than three out of five murder cases. In other words, two out of \nevery five killers are completely untouched by the law. When a killing is a family tragedy, or takes place between friends or \nacquaintances, the police make an arrest virtually every time. When the \npolice make an arrest, they say that the crime has been \"cleared\"; the \npercentage of crimes for which they make arrests is referred to as the \nclearance rate. Because murder has historically been a matter principally \namong families and friends, the homicide clearance rate in the past was \noften greater than 95 percent, even in the largest cities. As late as 1965 \nthe national homicide clearance rate was 91 percent. However, as crime has \nspread and changed its character over the past generation, clearance rates \nhave steadily dropped. In the past two years the national homicide \nclearance rate averaged 65.5 percent. The rate in the sixty-two largest \ncities is 60.5 percent. In the very largest cities--those with populations \nover a million--the rate is 58.3 percent. The missing killers are almost certainly not family members, friends, or \nneighbors. Rather, they are overwhelmingly strangers to their victims, and \ntheir acts are called \"stranger murders.\" Here is the true arithmetic: The \n40 percent of killings in which city police departments are unable to \nidentify and arrest perpetrators must overwhelmingly be counted as \nstranger murders; let us assume that 90 percent of them are committed by \nkillers unknown to the victims. That number is equivalent to 36 percent of \nthe total of all city murders. We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

Unfortunately, that report described only murders in which the killer was \nknown to prosecutors and an arrest was made. It did not mention that more \nand more killers remain unknown and at liberty after a full police \ninvestigation; every year the police make arrests in a smaller proportion \nof murder cases. In our largest cities the police now make arrests in \nfewer than three out of five murder cases. In other words, two out of \nevery five killers are completely untouched by the law. When a killing is a family tragedy, or takes place between friends or \nacquaintances, the police make an arrest virtually every time. When the \npolice make an arrest, they say that the crime has been \"cleared\"; the \npercentage of crimes for which they make arrests is referred to as the \nclearance rate. Because murder has historically been a matter principally \namong families and friends, the homicide clearance rate in the past was \noften greater than 95 percent, even in the largest cities. As late as 1965 \nthe national homicide clearance rate was 91 percent. However, as crime has \nspread and changed its character over the past generation, clearance rates \nhave steadily dropped. In the past two years the national homicide \nclearance rate averaged 65.5 percent. The rate in the sixty-two largest \ncities is 60.5 percent. In the very largest cities--those with populations \nover a million--the rate is 58.3 percent. The missing killers are almost certainly not family members, friends, or \nneighbors. Rather, they are overwhelmingly strangers to their victims, and \ntheir acts are called \"stranger murders.\" Here is the true arithmetic: The \n40 percent of killings in which city police departments are unable to \nidentify and arrest perpetrators must overwhelmingly be counted as \nstranger murders; let us assume that 90 percent of them are committed by \nkillers unknown to the victims. That number is equivalent to 36 percent of \nthe total of all city murders. We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

It did not mention that more \nand more killers remain unknown and at liberty after a full police \ninvestigation; every year the police make arrests in a smaller proportion \nof murder cases. In our largest cities the police now make arrests in \nfewer than three out of five murder cases. In other words, two out of \nevery five killers are completely untouched by the law. When a killing is a family tragedy, or takes place between friends or \nacquaintances, the police make an arrest virtually every time. When the \npolice make an arrest, they say that the crime has been \"cleared\"; the \npercentage of crimes for which they make arrests is referred to as the \nclearance rate. Because murder has historically been a matter principally \namong families and friends, the homicide clearance rate in the past was \noften greater than 95 percent, even in the largest cities. As late as 1965 \nthe national homicide clearance rate was 91 percent. However, as crime has \nspread and changed its character over the past generation, clearance rates \nhave steadily dropped. In the past two years the national homicide \nclearance rate averaged 65.5 percent. The rate in the sixty-two largest \ncities is 60.5 percent. In the very largest cities--those with populations \nover a million--the rate is 58.3 percent. The missing killers are almost certainly not family members, friends, or \nneighbors. Rather, they are overwhelmingly strangers to their victims, and \ntheir acts are called \"stranger murders.\" Here is the true arithmetic: The \n40 percent of killings in which city police departments are unable to \nidentify and arrest perpetrators must overwhelmingly be counted as \nstranger murders; let us assume that 90 percent of them are committed by \nkillers unknown to the victims. That number is equivalent to 36 percent of \nthe total of all city murders. We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival.

When the \npolice make an arrest, they say that the crime has been \"cleared\"; the \npercentage of crimes for which they make arrests is referred to as the \nclearance rate. Because murder has historically been a matter principally \namong families and friends, the homicide clearance rate in the past was \noften greater than 95 percent, even in the largest cities. As late as 1965 \nthe national homicide clearance rate was 91 percent. However, as crime has \nspread and changed its character over the past generation, clearance rates \nhave steadily dropped. In the past two years the national homicide \nclearance rate averaged 65.5 percent. The rate in the sixty-two largest \ncities is 60.5 percent. In the very largest cities--those with populations \nover a million--the rate is 58.3 percent. The missing killers are almost certainly not family members, friends, or \nneighbors. Rather, they are overwhelmingly strangers to their victims, and \ntheir acts are called \"stranger murders.\" Here is the true arithmetic: The \n40 percent of killings in which city police departments are unable to \nidentify and arrest perpetrators must overwhelmingly be counted as \nstranger murders; let us assume that 90 percent of them are committed by \nkillers unknown to the victims. That number is equivalent to 36 percent of \nthe total of all city murders. We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

We know that of the 60 percent of killers \nthe police do succeed in arresting, 20 percent have murdered strangers. \nThat is, they have committed 12 percent of all murders. As best we can \ncount, then, at least 48 percent of city murders are now being committed \nby killers who are not relatives or acquaintances of the victims. This simple arithmetic has been available to the government and its \nexperts for years. However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

However, the first government document to acknowledge \nthese facts was the FBI's annual report on crime in the United States for \n1993, which was released last December. The FBI now estimates that 53 \npercent of all homicides are being committed by strangers. For more than \ntwo decades, as homicide clearance rates have plummeted, law\nenforcement agencies have continued to assure the public that four fifths \nof all killings are the result of personal passions. Thus were we \ncounseled to fear our loved ones above all, to regard the family hearth as \nthe most dangerous place. Now that falsehood has been unmasked:the FBI \ntells us that actually 12 percent of all homicides take place within the \nfamily. Ihave heard no public official anywhere in the United States say a \nword about any of this. There is another important aspect to the arithmetic: the odds facing a \nrobber or holdup man as he decides whether to let his victim live. Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

Again, \nat least 48 percent of city homicides are stranger murders, but only 12 \npercent of city homicides result in arrest. That is, the odds that a \nholdup man who kills a stranger will be arrested appear to be one in four. \nThe Department of Justice tells us that of all those who are arrested for \nmurder, 73 percent will be convicted of some crime; and when convicted, \nthe killers of strangers tend to get the heaviest penalties. Nevertheless, \nthe cumulative chances of getting clean away with the murder of a stranger \nare greater than 80 percent. Street thugs may be smarter than they are \nusually given credit for being. They do not consult government reports, \nbut they appear to know the facts. New York bodega workers have \nexperienced an increasing incidence of holdups ending in murder even when \nthey have offered no resistance. Killing eliminates the possibility of \nwitness identification. Murder is the most frightening crime, but is the least common. Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

Much more \nfrequent are robbery and assault. Robbery, the forcible taking of property \nfrom the person of the victim, is the crime most likely to be committed by \na stranger; 75 percent of victims are robbed by strangers. Aggravated \nassault, the use of a weapon or other major force with the intention of \ncausing serious bodily harm, is the most common violent crime; 58 percent \nof aggravated assaults are committed by strangers. Attacks across racial lines are a special case of crimes by strangers. \nMost crimes, including 80 percent of violent crimes, are committed by \npersons of the same race as their victims. However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

However, the experiences of \nblacks and whites diverge in some respects. In cases involving a lone \noffender, 56 percent of white and Hispanic robbery victims report that \ntheir assailant was white or Hispanic and 40 percent that he was black. \nWhen two or more robbers commit the crime, white and Hispanic victims 38 \npercent of the time report them to be white or Hispanic, 46 percent of the \ntime black, and 10 percent of the time mixed. About eight percent of black \nvictims, in contrast, are robbed by whites or Hispanics, and more than 85 \npercent by blacks, whether the offenders are alone or in groups. Blacks \nand whites are robbed equally--75 percent of the time--by strangers, but \nas these figures indicate, whites are far more likely to be robbed by \nstrangers of a different race. This result occurs because there are many more white people and many more \nwhite victims: 87 percent of all violent crimes are committed against \nwhites and Hispanics. In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

In robberies lone white offenders select white \nvictims 96 percent of the time, and lone black offenders select white \nvictims 62 percent of the time. White rapists select white victims 97 \npercent of the time; black rapists select white victims 48 percent of the \ntime. Whites committing aggravated assault attack blacks in three percent \nof cases; blacks commit about half their assaults against whites. When all violent crimes are taken together, 58 percent of white victims \nand 54 percent of black victims report that their assailant was a \nstranger. Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

Citizens of all races who are fearful of random violence have \ngood reason for their concern. Storekeepers, utility workers, police \nofficers, and ordinary citizens out for a carton of milk or a family \ndinner are all increasingly at risk. TOWARD A RACE BEHIND BARS I n 1990 federal, state, and local governments combined spent about $8,921 \nper person. According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century.

But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy.

The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts.

The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed.

According to the Department of Justice, these governments \nspent $299 per person--about 3.3 percent of total public expenditures--on \nall civil- and criminal-justice activities, including $128 per person on \ndomestic police protection. On national defense and international \nrelations they spent $1,383 per person. Spending on the Armed Forces has historically risen to meet perceived \nthreats from hostile nations, or in case of rebellion. Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation.

In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

Sharply rising \ncrime rates have not brought equivalent increases in police forces. From \n1971 to 1990, as the rates of homicide and other violent crimes soared, \nper person expenditures (in constant dollars) on state and local police \nforces increased by only 12 percent.  Spending did increase on prisons--by \nmore than 150 percent. In 1992 state and federal prisons held 883,656 \ninmates (local jails held another 444,584). Out of every 100,000 residents \nof the United States, 344 were in prison (another 174 were in jail). \nPrison populations increased another seven percent in 1993, by which year \n2.9 times as many people were incarcerated as had been in 1980. The overwhelming majority of prison inmates are male. Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black.

Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

Of the 789,700 male \ninmates in 1992, 51 percent, or 401,700, were black, and nearly all the \nremaining 388,000 white. (Here Hispanics are included in both categories; \naccording to the Department of Justice, 93 percent of Hispanic prisoners \ndescribe themselves as white and seven percent as black. Asians and Native \nAmericans make up at most 2.5 percent of all prisoners.) Rates of \nimprisonment by race are therefore very different. In 1992, of every \n100,000 white and Hispanic male residents, 372 were prisoners. Of every \n100,000 black male residents, 2,678 were prisoners. The heaviest rates of imprisonment affect men aged twenty to forty. \nAlthough the overall imprisonment rate for black men is 2,678 per 100,000, \nit reaches 7,210 for every 100,000 aged twenty-five to twenty\nnine, and 6,299 for those aged thirty to thirty-four. At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years.

These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition?

At any one time six \nto seven percent of black men at these critical ages are in state and \nfederal prisons. (Most arrests, and most new prison sentences, are not for violent crimes. \nIn 1992 only 28.5 percent of offenders sentenced to state prisons had been \nconvicted of violent offenses; 31.2 percent had been convicted of property \noffenses, and 30.5 percent of drug offenses. These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength.

These numbers represent a \nmajor change in just over a decade: in 1980, 48.2 percent of newly \nsentenced offenders had been convicted of violent offenses, and only 6.8 \npercent of drug offenses. The Department of Justice has argued that many \npeople convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have also committed violent \noffenses. But there can be no question that the police are making more \ndrug arrests and relatively fewer arrests for violent crimes. For the past \nfive years drug arrests have averaged one million a year, and arrests for \nall violent crimes combined about 600,000.) A study was made of black men aged eighteen to thirty-four in the District \nof Columbia. On any given day in 1991, 15 percent of the men were in \nprison, 21 percent were on probation or parole, and six percent were being \nsought by the police or were on bond awaiting trial. The total thus \ninvolved with the criminal-justice system was 42 percent. The study \nestimated that 70 percent of black men in the District of Columbia would \nbe arrested before the age of thirty-five, and that 85 percent would be \narrested at some point in their lives.  There have been no studies of the \neffects of such high imprisonment rates on the wider black society--for \nexample, on the children of prisoners. No government or private agency has \nsuggested any way to lighten the influence of paternal and sibling \nimprisonment on children, or how to balance the potential value of such an \neffort against the need to suppress violent crimes. Although the crime \nbill will substantially expand prison space, no one has asked how much \nfurther we can go--whether it is possible, practically, socially, or \nmorally, to imprison some larger proportion of the black male population \nat any one time. WHAT'S ALREADY SPOKEN FOR I n 1965 Daniel Patrick Moynihan warned that a growing proportion of black \nchildren were being born to single mothers. When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five.

Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

When such large numbers of \nchildren were abandoned by their fathers and brought up by single mothers, \nhe said, the result was sure to be wild violence and social chaos. He was \nexcoriated as a racist and the subject was abandoned. The national rate of \nillegitimacy among blacks that year was 26 percent. It took just over a decade for the black illegitimacy rate to reach 50 \npercent. And in 1990, twenty-five years after Moynihan's warning, two \nthirds of black children were born to single mothers, many of them \nteenagers. Only a third of black children lived with both parents even in \nthe first three years of their lives. Seven percent of all black children \nand five percent of black children under the age of three were living with \nneither a father nor a mother in the house. The rate of illegitimacy more \nthan doubled in one generation. Social disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation.

A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

The Atlantic Monthly; July 1995; The Crisis of Public Order; Volume 276, \nNo. 1; pages 39-54.\n\nSocial disorder--in its many varieties, and with the assistance of \ngovernment policies--can perhaps be said to have caused the sudden \ncollapse of family institutions and social bonds that had survived three \ncenturies of slavery and oppression. It is at any rate certain that \nhundreds of thousands of the children so abandoned have become in their \nturn a major cause of instability. Most notably they have tended to commit \ncrimes, especially violent crimes, out of all proportion to their numbers. \nOf all juveniles confined for violent offenses today, less than 30 percent \ngrew up with both parents. How many killers are there, and who are they? In 1990 a total of 24,932 \nhomicides were reported. Of all killers identified by the nation's police \nforces and reported to the Department of Justice for that year, 43.7 \npercent were white and Hispanic and 54.7 percent were black. Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent.

That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics.

I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival.

Whites made \nup 83.9 percent of the population that year, and blacks 12.3 percent. The \nrate of homicide committed by whites was thus 5.2 per 100,000, and by \nblacks 44.7 per 100,000--or about eight times as great. In the large \ncounties analyzed by the Department of Justice, 62 percent of identified \nkillers were black. This is equivalent to a black homicide rate of 50.7 \nper 100,000--close to ten times the rate among other citizens. Serial killers and mass murderers, however, are overwhelmingly white. Of the urban killers identified by the Department of Justice in 1988, 90 \npercent were male. Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

Virtually none were aged fourteen or younger, but 16 \npercent were aged fifteen to nineteen, 24 percent were twenty to twenty\nfour, and 20 percent were twenty-five to twenty-nine. The white and black populations each suffered about 12,000 homicides in \n1990. But the black population base is smaller, and the rate at which \nblacks fall victim is much higher. The victimization rate for white males \nwas 9.0 per 100,000, and for white females 2.8 per 100,000. For black \nmales it was an astonishing 69.2, and for black females it was 13.5. \nAccording to the Department of Justice, one out of every twenty-one black \nmen can expect to be murdered. This is a death rate double that of \nAmerican servicemen in the Second World War. Prospects for the future are \napparent in the facts known about children already born. This is what \nSenator Moynihan means when he says the next thirty years are \"already \nspoken for.\" We first notice the children of the ghetto when they grow muscles--at \nabout the age of fifteen. The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent.

They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

The children born in 1965 reached their \nfifteenth year in 1980, and 1980 and 1981 set new records for criminal \nviolence in the United States, as teenage and young adult blacks ripped at \nthe fabric of life in the black inner city. Nevertheless, of all the black \nchildren who reached physical maturity in those years, three quarters had \nbeen born to a married mother and father. Not until 1991 did we experience \nthe arrival in their mid-teens of the first group of black youths fully \nhalf of whom had been born to single mothers--the cohort born in 1976. \nCriminal violence particularly associated with young men and boys reached \nnew peaks of destruction in black communities in 1990 and 1991. In the year 2000 the black youths born in 1985 will turn fifteen. Three \nfifths of them were born to single mothers, many of whom were drug\naddicted; one in fourteen will have been raised with neither parent at \nhome; unprecedented numbers will have been subjected to beatings and other \nabuse; and most will have grown up amid the utter chaos pervading black \ncity neighborhoods. It is supremely necessary to change the conditions \nthat are producing such cohorts. But no matter what efforts we now \nundertake, we have already assured the creation of more very violent young \nmen than any reasonable society can tolerate, and their numbers will grow \ninexorably for every one of the next twenty years. In absolute numbers the teenage and young adult population aged fifteen to \ntwenty-four stagnated or actually declined over the past decade. Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century.

One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

Crime has \nbeen rising because this smaller population has grown disproportionately \nmore violent. Now it is about to get larger in size. James Fox, a dean at \nNortheastern University, in Boston, has shown that from 1965 to 1985 the \nnational homicide rate tracked almost exactly the proportion of the \npopulation aged eighteen to twenty-four. Suddenly, in 1985, the two curves \ndiverged sharply. The number of young adults as a proportion of the \npopulation declined; but the overall homicide rate went up, because among \nthis smaller group the homicide rate increased by 65 percent in just eight \nyears. Among those aged fourteen to seventeen, the next group of young \nadults, the homicide rate more than doubled. What we experienced from 1985 \non was a conjunction of two terrible arrivals. One train carried the \nlegacy of the 1970s, the children of the explosion of illegitimacy and \npaternal abandonment. Crack arrived on the same timetable, and unloaded at \nthe same station. Fox shows further that by the year 2005 the population aged fourteen to \nseventeen will have increased by a remarkable 23 percent. Professor John \nDeIulio, of Princeton University, predicts that the number of homicides \nmay soon rise to 35,000 or 40,000 a year, with other violent offenses \nrising proportionally. Fox calls what we are about to witness an \n\"epidemic\" of teenage crime. He does not give a name to our present \ncondition. GUNS I t is a commonplace that many crimes are committed with guns, particularly \nhandguns. In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times.

BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

In 1993, 69.6 percent of all homicides were committed by gun, \nfour fifths of these by handgun. Guns were also used in 42.4 percent of \nall robberies and 25.1 percent of aggravated assaults. The total of such \ngun felonies reported to the police was about 571,000. As long as surveys have asked the question, about half of all American \nhouseholds have answered that they own at least one gun. Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice.

Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

Patterns of \nownership, however, have changed. In the 1960s weapons used primarily for \nsport--rifles and shotguns--made up 80 percent of the approximately 80 \nmillion guns in private hands. About 12 percent of the population reported \nowning one or more handguns. By 1976, with the great postwar crime wave \nunder way, more than 21 percent of the population reported owning \nhandguns--an increase of 75 percent. The largest increases were among \nnonwhites (by 99 percent), college graduates (by 147 percent), and Jews \n(by 679 percent, to a total of 14.8 percent reporting handgun ownership, \nwhich left them well behind Protestants but ahead of Catholics). By 1978 \nthe estimate of total number of guns owned had increased to roughly 120 \nmillion. In every year since, at least four million new guns have been manufactured \nor imported. In 1993 there were 5.1 million guns manufactured and another \n2.9 million imported. Of the eight million new guns in 1993, half--3.9 \nmillion--were handguns. The current estimate is that more than 200 million \nguns are in private hands. Twenty states allow any law-abiding citizen to carry a gun concealed on \nhis or her person, and fourteen more states are actively considering such \nlaws. In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers.

In some of the states where the laws have passed, about two percent \n(Oregon and Florida) or three percent (Pennsylvania)of the state's \npopulation have applied for and received a permit to carry a concealed \nhandgun at all times. There is evidence that many people own and carry \nhandguns without permits. One 1991 survey reported that a third of all \nAmericans own handguns, another that seven percent carry them outside the \nhome. A quarter of small business establishments may keep firearms for \nprotection. Last year The New York Times said that the city's bodegas had become \n\"Islands Under Siege,\" in which fifty store workers were killed in a year. \nIt reported on Omar Rosario, the manager of a grocery store whose previous \nowner was killed in a holdup. Rosario prepares for work by donning a \nbulletproof vest and sliding a nine-millimeter semi-automatic into his \nwaistband. When a young man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the \nstore, \"Mr. Rosario takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the \npocket of his pants, his finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets \nhim see the gun in his hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young \nman pulls a gun, he will be killed.\" Professor Gary Kleck, of Florida State University, has made a close \nexamination of citizens' use of firearms for self-defense, including in \n\"civilian legal defensive homicides.\" Self-defense is not a crime, and \nmost defensive uses of firearms, even when criminals are killed, are not \nroutinely reported to the FBI. On the basis of local studies Kleck \nestimates that at least 1,500 citizens used guns to kill criminals in \n1980. This is nearly three times the number of criminals killed by the \npolice. The Department of Justice thinks these numbers may be too high. \nNevertheless, it is evident that Omar Rosario is not the only citizen with \nhis finger on the trigger. BEYOND THE NUMBERS F or more than twenty years the children of the ghetto have witnessed \nviolent death as an almost routine occurrence. They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation.

President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation. But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation? It is true that the police, especially in the ghettos of older cities, \nhave often been corrupt, brutal, and ineffective, although they are almost \nalways better than most of their critics. The remedy for bad policing is \nfor good people to join the police force and make it better: that is why \nthe one truly promising feature of the 1994 crime bill is the creation of \na prototype Police Corps, a police ROTC that will offer four-year college \nscholarships to the best and most committed of our young people in return \nfor four years of police service following their graduation. Now and for \nmany years into the future the opportunity to give the greatest service to \none's fellow citizens will be as a member of a police force --the one \ntruly indispensable agency of a free and civil government. Others will say--not openly, because this kind of thing is never said \nopenly--that it's hopeless, and that the best we can hope for is that the \nkillers will kill one another and leave the rest of us alone. Indeed, a \nvisitor from another planet might well conclude that only such a belief \ncould explain our society's otherwise inexplicable passivity. History \nshould save us from such vile and horrible thoughts. Despite all \nvicissitudes, within two generations of Emancipation black families had \nachieved levels of stability and nurture comparable or superior to those \nof many immigrant groups. The long history of black people in America has \nnot been one of violent or cruel conduct beyond the national norm. Rather, \nit is a story of great heroism and dignity, of a steady upward course from \nslavery to just the other day. The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history but of \nthis generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of government \nto create a welfare system that began the destruction of black family \nlife. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality, celebrated \nlicense, and glorified fecklessness; as the columnist Joe Klein has \nobserved, it is in moral conduct above all that the rich catch cold and \nthe poor get pneumonia. It was stupidity and cowardice, along with a \npurposeful impulse toward justice, that led the entire governmental \napparatus, the system of law enforcement and social control, to cede the \nblack ghettos to self-rule and virtual anarchy in the 1960s and 1970s, and \nto abandon them entirely since. It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed. I have spoken of the need to change conditions among blacks, because they \nare experiencing the greatest suffering and the gravest danger today. But \nlet none of us pretend that the bell tolls only for blacks; there is no \nsalvation for one race alone, no hope for separate survival. At stake for \nall of us is the future of American cities, the promise of the American \nnation, and the survival of our Constitution and of American democracy \nitself.

They have seen it on their \nstreets, in their schools, in their families, and on TV. They have lived \nwith constant fear. Many have come to believe that they will not live to \nsee twenty-five. These are often children whose older brothers, friends, \nand uncles have taught them that only the strong and the ruthless survive. \nPrison does not frighten them--it is a rite of passage that a majority of \ntheir peers may have experienced. Too many have learned to kill without \nremorse, for a drug territory or for an insult, because of a look or a \nbump on the sidewalk, or just to do it: why not? These young people have been raised in the glare of ceaseless media \nviolence and incitement to every depravity of act and spirit. Movies may \nfeature scores of killings in two hours' time, vying to show methods ever \nmore horrific; many are quickly imitated on the street. Television \ncommercials teach that a young man requires a new pair of $120 sneakers \neach week. Major corporations make and sell records exhorting their \nlisteners to brutalize Koreans, rob store owners, rape women, kill the \npolice. Ashamed and guilt-ridden, elite opinion often encourages even \nhoodlums to carry a sense of entitlement and grievance against society and \nits institutions. These lessons are being taught to millions of children as I write and you \nread. They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion.

But all too \nmany black citizens already live in territories occupied by hostile bands \nof brigands. How can these citizens be freed except by forces devoted to \ntheir liberation?

It is the evident policy of the \nentertainment industry to seek profit by exploiting the most degraded \naspects of human and social character. None of this is necessary. All of \nit can be changed.

They have already been taught to the age groups that will reach \nphysical maturity during the rest of this century. The worst lesson we have taught these benighted children I have saved for \nlast, because it is a lesson we have also taught ourselves: We will do \nalmost anything not to have to act to defend ourselves, our country, or \nour character as people of decency and strength. We have fled from our \ncities, virtually abandoning great institutions such as the public \nschools. We have permitted the spread within our country of wastelands \nruled not by the Constitution and lawful authority but by the anarchic \nforce of merciless killers. We have muted our dialogue and hidden our \nthoughts. We have abandoned millions of our fellow citizens--people of \ndecency and honor trying desperately to raise their children in love and \nhope--to every danger and degraded assault. We have become isolated from \none another, dispirited about any possibility of collective or political \naction to meet this menace. We shrink in fear of teenage thugs on every \nstreet. More important, we shrink even from contemplating the forceful \ncollective action we know is required. We abandon our self-respect and our \nresponsibility to ourselves and our posterity. How to change all this, how to recover heart and spirit, how to save the \nlives and souls of millions of children, and how to save ourselves from \nthis scourge of violent anarchy--in short, how to deal with things as they \nare, how to respond to the implacable and undeniable numbers: this will be \nthe real measure and test of our political system. But more than that, it \nwill be the measure of our own days and work, the test of our own lives \nand heritage. WHERE DO WE START? A MODEST RADICALISM I n the past decade 200,000 of our citizens have been killed and millions \nwounded. If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost. The question has a ready answer. We have a gross domestic \nproduct of more than $6 trillion, and a federal budget of more than $1.6 \ntrillion. President Clinton has requested $261.4 billion for defense \nagainst foreign enemies who killed fewer than a hundred Americans in all \nof last year. It would be silly to suggest that the federal government \nshould not or cannot spend an eighth as much--two percent of even a \nshrunken federal budget--to defend the nation against domestic enemies who \nkilled more than 10,000 people who were strangers to them in 1994, and who \nwill surely kill more in every year that lies ahead. This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing. Beyond doubt we must reform \nwelfare, minimize illegitimacy, change the schools, strengthen employment \nopportunities, end racism. In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk. And dishonest talk besides: there can be \nno truth to our public discussions while whites are filled with fear of \nblack violence, and blacks live every day with the fear and bitter \nknowledge that they and their children have been abandoned to the rule of \ncriminals. If some foreign enemy had invaded New England, slaughtering its \npeople and plundering its wealth, would we be debating agricultural \nsubsidies and the future of Medicaid while complaining that the deficit \nprevented us from enlarging the Army or buying more ammunition? Would the \nbudget really force us to abandon New Hampshire? Why is this case \ndifferent? NONE OF THIS IS NECESSARY S ome people will say that I propose an army of occupation.

This is not a complete program, because this is not the time for a \ncomplete program. We have to stop the killing.

In the midst of this war, while the killing \ncontinues, all that is just talk.

If we assume, with the FBI, that 47 percent of them were killed \nby friends and family members, that leaves 106,000 dead at the hands of \nstrangers. Ten years of war in Vietnam killed 58,000 Americans. Over an \nequal period we have had almost the exact equivalent of two Vietnam Wars \nright here at home. Whether fighting the war or fighting against the war, \nparticipants and opponents alike engaged Vietnam with fury and passion and \na desperate energy. Were we to find such energy, such passion, now, how \nmight we use it? Where would we start? I suggest simplicity. If your \nterritory and your citizens are under constant deadly assault, the first \nthing you do is protect them. To do this we need forces. We need a very large number of additional \npolice officers: at least half a million in the next five years, and \nperhaps more thereafter. We do not need more private police, who protect \nonly the circumscribed property of better-off citizens who can afford to \npay; we need public police, whose mission is the protection of all \ncitizens, and who are available for work in the ghettos and housing \nprojects where most of the dying is taking place. If we as a society expect black citizens to construct reasonable lives, we \ncannot continue to abandon so many of them and their children to criminal \ndepredation. If we expect children to respect law and the rights of \nothers, it would seem elementary that we must respect the law and their \nrights enough to keep them from getting murdered. We need a larger police force not to imprison more of our fellow citizens \nbut to liberate them. The police need not function as the intake valve of \na criminal-justice system devoted to the production of more prison \ninmates, of whom we already have more than is healthy; their true role is \nto suppress violence and criminal activity, to protect public space that \nnow serves as the playground and possession of the violent. The role of \nthe police is to guard schools and homes, neighborhoods and commerce, and \nto protect life; they should represent the basic codes and agreements by \nwhich we live with one another. Today's vastly undermanned police forces, \nwhose officers race from call to call, taking endless reports of crimes \nthey were not around to prevent, do not control the streets. They do not \nexercise and cannot embody the authority for which we look to government. \nRather, it is the most violent young men of the street who set the tone \nand filter the light in which the children of the city are growing. That \nis what we need at least half a million new officers just to begin to \nchange. Some will ask how we are to afford the $30 billion or so a year that this \nwould cost.

      "text": "Caught Between the Electorally Disastrous and the Morally Monstrous\n\nDemocrats can't find a message on crime they believe in.\n\nThe great drama of politics is that no one knows the outcome of an election until the votes are cast. But some things about elections are pretty easy to predict-such as Republicans attacking Democrats on crime. Yet Democrats seem to have no answer to the attacks being lobbed at them in the final weeks of the midterm campaign, just as they are only now awakening to the fact that it might be wise to have an economic message for voters.\n\nCrime is a devilish problem. Its causes are hard to understand and harder to influence. The trends run in long cycles, and although policy changes can alter the trends, they don't do so quickly or simply. Expecting any candidate, or any party, to have a genuine answer to crime would be absurd. But crime is also politically potent, as Republicans grasp, and is thus fertile ground for attacks both fair and demagogic. (Just because you don't have a simple, quick answer doesn't mean you can't claim you do.) In key races, Republicans have accused Democrats of being soft and ineffective on crime. They've attacked incumbents for presiding over rising violence and challengers for having supported cuts in police spending. In Illinois, the gubernatorial hopeful Darren Bailey even rented a Chicago apartment far from his farm as a way to spotlight crime.\n\nRead: What's really going on with the crime rate?\n\nThe Democratic Party's situation is tougher. The pollster Stan Greenberg has found that worry about rising crime under Democrats is a more potent fear than any other issue this cycle. As the party in power in Washington, it has to play defense. Any message has to satisfy swing voters and older Black voters worried about crime without alienating younger and more liberal voters who want changes to the justice system. The simplest answers are likely to undercut the party's stated commitment to social justice and greater racial equality, and its conclusion that crime is best treated through root causes. The party is left without a message-much less an actual policy-that steers between being electorally disastrous and morally monstrous.\n\nBecause this is politics, facts matter, but they're not always paramount . Still, the actual data are worth surveying. Violent crime, including murder , increased sharply in 2020 , although property crime decreased. The situation in 2021 is much less clear. FBI data released in October show that violent crime was roughly flat last year (with a drop in robberies canceling out an increase in murders), but those numbers are not considered reliable , thanks to a change in the way the FBI gathers numbers that has left out statistics from many agencies. Preliminary data gathered by other organizations suggest a small decrease in murders and shootings in 2022, but also an uptick in property crimes .\n\nWhatever the case, Americans are freaked out about crime. A Gallup poll released last week found that 78 percent of Americans say crime is increasing nationwide, matching the figure from 2020. (The all-time record, 89 percent, was set in 1992, when crime, in fact, hit its recorded high.) For the first time since 2016, a majority of Americans say they worry a \"great deal\" about crime. Less than a quarter are satisfied with crime policies-a 50 percent drop from 2020. More than seven in 10 say crime will be very or extremely important in their vote for Congress.\n\nDemocrats defending their record and critics of the criminal-justice system-two groups that have some overlap but also sharp disagreements-sometimes downplay crime and insist that people shouldn't be so fearful. They correctly note that even after the 2020 spike, crime remains well below the worst levels of the late 1980s and early '90s. They also correctly say that fears of crime are often driven more by the media and their bias for negative and lurid stories than by actual increases in crime.\n\nIdeology drives coverage decisions too: The Washington Post finds that although all three of the big cable-news channels have been covering crime more in recent weeks, Fox News has far outpaced its rivals. One result is that views on crime are heavily polarized- Gallup's finding that Americans see increased crime is driven largely by Republicans. Since 2020, the percentage of Republicans who say that crime has risen in the U.S. has increased from 85 percent to 95 percent. Over the same period, the percentage of Democrats who say the same has fallen from 74 percent to 61 percent, suggesting that ideology shapes their impression that crime is dropping.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Nothing seems to be reducing crime in Memphis\n\nThe apologists also argue-once again, with good reason-that messaging around crime, whether in the press or from conservative politicians, is often rooted in appeals to racism . A recent, almost amusingly naive New York Times article reported , \"As Republicans seize on crime as one of their leading issues in the final weeks of the midterm elections, they have deployed a series of attack lines, terms and imagery that have injected race into contests across the country.\" Although the ads are worth noting, the phenomenon is hardly new. Richard Nixon used the threat of urban crime-that is to say, crime putatively committed by Black people-as a key campaign issue in 1968 and 1972. The George H. W. Bush strategist Lee Atwater infamously employed the case of William Horton to attack the Democratic nominee, Michael Dukakis, in 1988. And in 2016, Trump's heavily racist immigration rhetoric focused squarely on crimes committed by unauthorized immigrants.\n\nA staple of these attacks is a connection between urban areas and crime. Fear of crime drove white families out of cities and into suburbs starting in the mid-20th century, and once many white people left urban areas, politicians could easily yoke Black populations and violence together. Cities tend to have more consistent and easily accessed data, as well as more media attention, but violent crime has risen nearly as steeply in rural areas as in urban ones, The Wall Street Journal reported in June. During a gubernatorial debate in Oklahoma last month, the Democrat, Joy Hofmeister, drew jeers and dismissal for saying that the violent-crime rate in the Sooner State is higher than in California or New York, but she was right. (Perhaps it is no accident that Hofmeister is polling close to the Republican incumbent, Governor Kevin Stitt, in a deeply conservative state.)\n\nYet even if all of these rebuttals to concerns are true, crime really has jumped from the recent historic low. Besides, voters can't simply be argued into giving up the way they feel, and few issues strike as directly at people as the fear that they or their loved ones might become victims of crime. In 2021, I reported that although Americans were concerned about rising crime nationwide, they tended to say that crime in their own neighborhoods remained about the same. Now, however, 56 percent of Americans tell Gallup that crime is up in their area-the highest since the pollster started measuring this sentiment, in 1972. (The violent-crime rate in 2020, the most recent year for which data are available, was almost 400 per 100,000 people; in 1992, it was roughly 760 per 100,000 people, but only 54 percent said crime was rising in their neighborhood.)\n\nIndividual Democrats have tried to find their own ways to talk about this. Representative Val Demings, who is running for the U.S. Senate in Florida, has drawn on her career as a police officer . But the Democratic Party writ large has not found a message. Stan Greenberg writes in The American Prospect that by the fall, the issue had become so dire that he advised candidates to not even bring it up: \"To be honest, Democrats were in such terrible shape on crime at this late point, I said, speak as little as possible or mumble. Nothing they've said up until now was reassuring and helpful.\"\n\nIn 2020, the challenge was that one portion of the party supported \" defunding the police \"-a vague phrase that encompassed everything from full-on abolition to experiments such as unarmed mental-health responders, and that was wildly unpopular with voters -while another, led by Joe Biden, did not. By this March, when President Biden used his State of the Union address to say, \"Fund them. Fund them. Fund them,\" the backlash within the Democratic Party was minimal.\n\nEven with this intramural debate quieted, Democrats have no effective messaging to voters. In a letter to colleagues last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi offered some tips on how to talk about public safety, suggesting that candidates discuss the 2021 stimulus package and the 2022 spending bill, both of which provided money for local law enforcement. But those bills are arguably a Democratic liability overall , and bone-dry recitations of bills that people don't view as having stopped crime from rising seem unlikely to have much effect. (Pelosi also said that Democrats should spotlight bills the House has passed to ban assault weapons and mandate safe gun storage. This might actually be popular-according to Gallup, no fear has risen more sharply over the past year than that of a child being harmed at school-but neither initiative has become law.)\n\nThis isn't to rag on Pelosi in particular. Immediate solutions are in short supply. Scholars and police have no consensus on why crime declined so much from the 1990s until recently, and they have only provisional answers to why it's started rising again. Many cities want to hire more police, but even when they have the funding to do so, recruits are in short supply. Reducing the number of guns on the streets would have a major effect, but it is politically impossible. Liberals tend to gravitate toward explanations for crime that focus on root causes, such as education and economic opportunity-but those are difficult and slow to fix, which makes them difficult to translate into pithy electoral slogans.\n\nOne example does exist of Democrats finding a way to win on crime: the 1992 election, when Bill Clinton emphasized crime by turning against core Democratic constituencies. (He famously accused the author and rapper Sister Souljah of being racist against white people.) It was extremely politically effective, and Clinton was able to win the presidency and grab back historically Democratic white voters who had defected to Ronald Reagan's Republican Party.\n\nRead: Rorschach's crime bill\n\nAping Clinton would be unlikely to work so well today. Many of those voters seem to be permanently lost to the Trump movement and white identity politics . Although Black voters tend to be generationally divided on crime and policing (older voters are more hawkish; younger ones are skeptical), the white voters who remain in the Democratic Party lean very liberal on social issues. Clinton also benefited from Democrats being out of power in 1992; two years later, voters rejected the party and ushered in the Republican Revolution.\n\nMore important, Clinton's crime approach culminated in the 1994 crime bill, a massive piece of legislation that, although it contained some measures that were effective at fighting crime (such as the Violence Against Women Act and the assault-weapons ban), also included others that have not aged well. For example, the bill exacerbated racial disparities in drug sentencing and imposed lengthy mandatory-minimum sentences that took away judges' and prosecutors' discretion. By 2020, the law was anathema to the Democratic Party.\n\nReturning to a simplistic tough-on-crime approach would be unconscionable today. One lesson of 2020, which is already being forgotten in some quarters, is how deeply flawed the criminal-justice system is. Simply giving it more resources and hoping for the best might produce a short-term drop in violent crime, but it would also be unsustainable and unjust, as the scholar Patrick Sharkey has argued .\n\nDemocrats won't figure out how to square electoral imperatives on crime with moral ones in time for the 2022 election, and they will suffer for it at the polls. But the problem isn't going away, so they'll have plenty of opportunities to keep working at it."

      "text": "Moynihan, Mass Incarceration, and Responsibility\n\nGood intentions and deep sympathies cannot counter corrosive doctrines and destructive policy.\n\nI want to respond to Greg Weiner's contention that I've offered a distorted picture of Daniel Patrick Moynihan. There's a lot wrong with Weiner's note. I specifically object to the idea that the Moynihan Report left its authors reputation \"in tatters.\"\n\nIt is certainly true that Moynihan suffered through more than his share of unfair criticism after the release of The Case for National Action . It is also true that within two years of the Moynihan Report's release, the author was being hailed on the cover of TIME magazine as America's \"urbanologist.\" That same year Life magazine lauded Moynihan as the \"idea broker in the race crisis.\" After leaving the Johnson administration, Moynihan went on to a lucrative post at Harvard, became the urban affairs guru for one president and the UN ambassador for another, and then served for an unbroken four terms in the Senate. Furthermore, Moynihan's central idea-that the problems of families are key to ending the problems of poverty-dominates the national discourse today. I suspect the president would take no insult in being described as a disciple of Moynihan. If this is all part and parcel of having your reputation destroyed, it is an enviable specimen of the genre.\n\nWeiner's claim is, of course, much larger. He accuses me of merely hinting at Moynihan bearing some responsibility for mass incarceration, and cleverly leaving the nasty work to the editor's note written by James Bennet :\n\nCoates demonstrates that white Americans' fear of black Americans, and their impulse to control blacks, are integral to the rise of the carceral state. A result is that one of every four black men born since the late 1970s has spent time in prison, at profound cost to his family. For this, Coates holds Moynihan, in part, responsible.\n\nSince Weiner believes I was being coy, let me directly state that I wholly concur with this interpretation . My argument is that mass incarceration is built on a long history of viewing black people as unequal in general, and criminal in the specific. Both of these trends can be found in Moynihan's arguments. I detail them in the article right here . That said, I have no problem bearing down and expanding on this notion.\n\nThe Negro lower class would appear to be unusually self-damaging, that is to say, more so than is normal for such groups...\n\nThe Negro poor having become more openly violent-especially in the form of the rioting of the mid 1960's-they have given the black middle class an incomparable weapon with which to threaten white America. This has been for many an altogether intoxicating experience. 'Do this or the cities will burn...' What building contracts and police graft were to the 19th-century urban Irish, the welfare department, Head Start, and Black Studies programs will be to the coming generation of Negroes. They are of course very wise in this respect.\n\nWith no real evidence, I would nonetheless suggest that a great deal of the crime, the fire setting, the rampant school violence, and other such phenomenon in the black community have become quasi-politicized. Hatred-revenge-against whites is now an acceptable excuse for doing what might have been done anyway. This is bad news for any society, especially when it takes the form which the Black Panthers seem to have adopted. This social alienation among the black lower classes is matched, and probably enhanced, by a virulent form of anti-white feeling among portions of the large and prospering black middle class. It would be difficult to overestimate the degree to which young well educated blacks detest white America.\n\nA new voice is being heard in America today. It is a voice that has been silent too long. It is a voice of people who have not taken to the streets before, who have not indulged in violence, who have not broken the law.... These forgotten Americans finally have become angry....\n\nThey have not really found a voice in American politics, but they are indeed angry. And have reason to be.\n\nYou ask, \"What is our answer.\" To which I suppose my first reaction would be to ask, \"What is their question?\" ...\n\nWhat is the question? It is this: How is the great mass of white working people to regain a sense of positive advantage from the operation of American government, and retain a steady loyalty to the processes of American society, at a time when those above and below them in the social hierarchy seem simultaneously to be robbing the system blind and contemptuously dismissing all its rules.\n\nMoynihan wrote this right at the moment that Nixon is playing on old notions of blacks and criminality. He did very little to counter this stratagem; indeed, his memos endorse the underlying logic. Moynihan presented a portrait to the president of an America riven by two groups-hard-working, law-abiding, working-class whites and criminal and scheming blacks. He then complimented Nixon's efforts to help the schemers in rather incredible terms:\n\nDuring the past year intense efforts have been made by the administration to develop programs that will be of help to the blacks. I dare say, as much or more time and attention goes into this effort in this administration than any in history.\n\nIn re-reading through these memos, and others, one is struck by their mixed nature. I almost had the sense that Moynihan was trying to trick Nixon into embracing liberal policy. Through all of his memos Moynihan  remains thoroughly committed to government action to help black families. He believes the black poor to be \"unusually self-damaging,\" but he does not believe they should be left to their fate. He believes the government should invest in poor black communities. But this is accompanied by a telling dig-aiding the ghettoes would prevent the militant black middle class from threatening the \"the larger society much as the desperate bank robber threatens to drop the vial of nitroglycerin.\" Moynihan used the rhetoric of black criminalization, even in arguing for government aid. It takes a peculiar blindness to wonder why we built prisons instead.\n\nThe point is not that Moynihan wanted prisons.  I am certain the growth in incarceration truly horrified Moynihan. And I don't doubt for a minute the sincerity in the words that Weiner quotes in Moynihan's defense. But the possession of good intentions, and deep sympathies, does not absolve men with power of their responsibility, nor of their imprudence. Whatever his ultimate goals, Moynihan buttressed, and employed, the logic of black criminality and white victimhood. Are we to simply ignore this because we approve of Moynihan's sympathies?\n\nThe white working men whom Moynihan lauded had long been about the business of keeping black men out of the building trades. Moynihan knew this. But when it came time to pay the debt, Moynihan put it elsewhere. \"We must not rest until every able-bodied Negro male is working,\" he wrote. \"Even if we have to displace some females.\"\n\nCommenting on the plight of unemployment of black men in the 1960s to Time , Moynihan is not so much concerned with racism as he is with black women playing their proper position:\n\nWhen these Negro G.I.s come back from Viet Nam, I would meet them with a real estate agent, a girl who looks like Diahann Carroll, and a list of jobs. I'd try to get half of them into the grade schools, teaching kids who've never had anyone but women telling them what to do.\n\nPerhaps this is all too abstract for Weiner. Perhaps he is not convinced that merely encouraging a belief in black criminality at the highest levels of government is sufficient. Perhaps one believes mass incarceration not to be a matter of where policy comes from, but of who ultimately supported and enacted the policy. From this perspective, for Moynihan to be \"partly responsible\" for mass incarceration he would need to have supported policy that directly encouraged it. I don't agree with this standard. But even if I did, it would offer no defense.\n\nIn 1994, Congress passed the Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act, the largest crime bill passed in American history. The 1994 Crime Bill, as it has come to be known, is also arguably the federal government's greatest contribution to the moral catastrophe of mass incarceration. It literally funded it. The law funneled money into states that built more prisons and took up \"truth in sentencing\" laws that lengthened time served. It had the perverse effect of encouraging the growth of prisons, even as crime fell. Daniel Patrick Moynihan voted for that bill .\n\nI spent the past year poring over books on and by Moynihan and examining as many memos written by him and articles on him as I could get my hands on. I came away with tremendous respect for his intelligence, his foresight and his broad, ranging curiosity. I did not come away from the research thinking him a racist. I did not come away thinking he was a conservative. But this is precisely the point. The story of mass incarceration, of American racism, is not simply a story of evil racists. It is also the story of people trying to help. And it is also the story of these same people not fully understanding the ugly traditions alive in their own country. Black criminalization is such a tradition and when Moynihan employed it he was playing with fire. Others got burned."

      "text": "Biden Doesn't Have an Answer to America's Crime Spike\n\nThe president has few levers he can pull on to reduce the country's murder rate.\n\nJoe Biden knows he needs to appear to be doing something about crime.\n\nMurder rates around the country rose precipitously in 2020, and in many cities the increases have continued into 2021. But the president has few levers to affect crime quickly, and faces political hazards in every direction. Biden has championed police reform, and many progressive Democrats have pushed for sharp reductions in police budgets.\n\nThe result was an unsatisfying announcement yesterday, delivered by a meandering Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland, about new federal efforts to fight gun violence.\n\nThe public is alarmed. While crime remains lower than it was at its 1990s peak, a recent poll conducted by Leger in collaboration with The Atlantic finds that six in 10 Americans view crime in the country as a major issue. The problem, for Biden, is that there's simply not much the federal government can do: The fastest initiatives seem unlikely to have much effect, while others have more potential but are unlikely to come to fruition soon. Law enforcement in the United States is largely conducted on the local and state levels, with a limited federal role. Federal efforts at crime fighting can have unintended consequences, as the huge increase in incarceration that followed the 1994 crime bill demonstrated.\n\nOne thing Washington does effectively is shovel money at a problem, a brute-force way to fight, for example, a pandemic-induced economic downturn. Crime doesn't necessarily work the same way. What drives crime-both up, as is the case now, and down, as occured from the '90s until recently-is not well understood. Money can be used to, for example, hire more police officers, but training cops takes time, and besides, many departments are already struggling to fill open, funded positions, according to a survey from the Police Executive Research Forum .\n\nDerek Thompson: Why America's great crime decline is over\n\nWriting checks to hire cops might be politically untenable for Biden. Although the president pointedly distanced himself from Democrats who have called for defunding the police, a huge increase in federal funding to departments would likely spark an insurrection on his left flank, at a moment when the president is already struggling to hold together his fragile coalition on voting rights and infrastructure-not to mention trying to nurture a bipartisan police-reform bill.\n\nBiden focused his efforts on gun violence instead. On Tuesday, the Justice Department announced the creation of new gun-trafficking strike forces in five major cities, with the goal of stemming the illegal flow of guns.\n\n\"With these strike forces, local and federal law enforcement and prosecutors are going to be able to better coordinate the prosecution of illegal gun trafficking across city and state lines, so illegal guns sold from the back door of a gun shop in Virginia don't end up at a murder scene in Baltimore,\" Biden said yesterday.\n\nThis makes political sense: Most Democrats agree on at least modest increases in gun control, and large portions of the population support measures such as universal background checks. Stricter enforcement against illegal gun trafficking is simple enough, because it relies on existing laws. Moreover, contra the familiar NRA slogan, guns do kill people; firearms consistently account for a large majority of murders in the United States , and there's evidence of a big recent jump in the number of guns that Americans own . Other categories of crime have not increased the way murders have over the past year.\n\nWhether this focus on firearms will really affect crime is a different question. Criminologists don't agree on the specific causes and mechanisms of the recent increase in murders, which coincided with the coronavirus pandemic and especially with protests against police violence last summer . Fighting the root causes requires understanding what they are, but in the meantime, Biden's focus on gun trafficking might have limited effect.\n\n\"What it's doing is trying to address the supply, and it's not doing a thing about the demand,\" Jerry Ratcliffe , a criminal-justice professor at Temple University, told me. \"We have a vicious cycle. Guns on the street are fueling shootings, and more shootings are fueling more guns on the street.\"\n\nRead: What caused the great crime decline in the U.S.?\n\nThe federal government can only go after guns that are being sold illegally. But most guns are purchased and owned legally. Biden would surely be happy to sign more sweeping gun controls, but Republicans in Congress continue to block any new legislation, and previous Democratic presidents have already tried many of the most promising executive actions.\n\nThe most intriguing element of Biden's announcement is a push for community violence-intervention (CVI) programs. While there are a range of designs for these programs, some of them have shown impressive efficacy in reducing gun violence. Mark Obbie wrote about the promising results of such programs in stopping shootings in The Atlantic in 2019 .\n\nThomas Abt, a senior fellow at the Council on Criminal Justice and a former Justice Department official, has championed such efforts, and told me he was cautiously optimistic about the Biden initiatives.\n\nYesterday's announcement \"features much-needed federal resources for law enforcement, community-based service providers, the hiring of returning citizens, and more,\" he said. \"Partnership across sectors and constituencies will continue to be critical in the fight against gun violence.\"\n\nMaking CVI programs work requires time, money, and the right partners. The White House has told local governments that they can use money from the American Rescue Plan, the stimulus bill passed in March, for CVI programs. Biden has also asked Congress to allocate $5 billion for these programs. But even if Congress agreed, that money wouldn't be available in time to mitigate the annual summer surge in violence.\n\nBiden has been careful not to overpromise, warning, \"There is no one answer that fits everything.\" That's certainly the case, but it's unlikely to absolve the Biden administration in the public's mind, during what may be a very violent summer ahead."

      "text": "How Criminal-Justice Reform Fell Apart\n\nFor a brief period, culminating two summers ago, the United States seemed to be on the verge of a serious rethinking.\n\nA typical way to think about history is as a series of turning points. Sometimes it's just as useful to think about the moments that looked like turning points and then turned out not to be.\n\nFor a brief period, culminating two summers ago, the United States seemed to be on the verge of a serious rethinking of its approach to criminal justice. Years of falling crime had made citizens open to new policies. Democrats and Republicans alike agreed that too many people were in American prisons for too long, and the GOP-led Congress passed the First Step Act, a major reform package that aimed to reduce federal prison sentences, in 2018. A series of police killings of Black people, starting with Michael Brown in 2014, had already brought new attention to the excesses of policing, use of force, and racism.\n\nThen in March 2020, Breonna Taylor died in a police raid gone wrong in Louisville, Kentucky, and in May 2020, George Floyd was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis. These deaths galvanized already shifting public sentiment, and inspired the largest protests in American history. Support for Black Lives Matter, disapproval of police, and belief that Black Americans suffer regular discrimination surged, especially among white Americans.\n\nAdam Serwer: The new Reconstruction\n\nTwo years later, those demonstrations look like a high-water mark in the push for reform, not a breakthrough moment. Rising violent-crime rates and changing political circumstances have sapped the demand for change. Many of the most ambitious overhauls considered after Floyd's murder have been abandoned or reversed. Republicans have soured on the ideas behind the First Step Act. A May poll from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst finds diminished support for BLM and a range of police reforms. Voters even in the most liberal cities have signaled that they want tougher policies on crime. What's now clear is that the support for criminal-justice reform was a mile wide and an inch deep.\n\nThe biggest change is the rise in crime, especially violent crime . For reasons that are still not fully understood, several major categories of crime (but not all) began spiking during the summer of 2020. The jump was correlated with the coronavirus pandemic and lockdowns, as well as with the protests. In a Pew Research Center poll in June 2020 , just four in 10 Americans viewed violent crime as a very big problem. Today, 54 percent do -and nine in 10 say it's at least a moderately big problem. (The increase reflects greater concern among white, Black, and Hispanic Americans alike.) Americans were ready to take a chance on reforms as long as they felt safe, but rising crime rates rattled confidence, even though crime nearly everywhere remains far below historical highs.\n\nOne of the many victims of this crime wave was the fledgling bipartisan consensus on criminal justice. In 2016, Donald Trump campaigned for president while making false claims about rising crime, but early in his term, he embraced the First Step Act, under the influence of his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, whose father had been incarcerated. But Trump's heart never seemed to be in it. After Floyd's death, he initially condemned police violence, but quickly grasped that unreservedly backing police and warning about crime could be a useful wedge issue in his reelection campaign.\n\nJoe Biden, Trump's opponent, was unusually well positioned to absorb these political blows. Although his role in passing the 1994 crime bill was a liability in the 2020 Democratic primary, his skepticism of calls to defund the police and long ties with law enforcement helped neutralize Trump's attacks. They also probably neutralized the reform push once he took office. The White House adopted a hands-off approach as Congress tried and ultimately failed to reach a bipartisan deal on a police-reform bill. Later, when a draft executive order including new national standards and guidelines for policing leaked in January 2022, the White House moved to make nice with law-enforcement groups.\n\nBiden finally signed an executive order yesterday that establishes a database of fired officers, bans chokeholds, and includes some other provisions, but it's only binding on federal law-enforcement agencies-not the overwhelming majority of the roughly 18,000 police departments in the country. Meanwhile, the issue has become the subject of the normal partisan bickering. \"Last fall, Senate Republicans rejected the George Floyd Justice in Policing act,\" Vice President Kamala Harris said at a ceremony unveiling the order. \"They walked away from their moral obligation to address what caused millions of Americans to walk in the street, the critical need that a coalition of Americans were demanding, were pleading for, in terms of reform and accountability.\"\n\nOne of the most notable moments in Biden's first State of the Union address, in March, came when the president said, \"We should all agree: The answer is not to de fund the police. The answer is to fund the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities. Fund them. Fund them. Fund them.\" Earlier this month, he called on states to spend stimulus money, passed as pandemic relief, on law enforcement. Funding police is not necessarily antithetical to new approaches-Democrats have noted that extra cash can help fund mental-health response programs as an alternative to sworn officers, for example-but Biden's comments underscore how policy makers have switched their focus from reform to crime-fighting.\n\nDavid A. Graham: America is having a violence wave, not a crime wave\n\nOne promise of the 2010s reform movement, with strong evidence in some instances, is that citizens could have fairer policing without sacrificing any safety. New York City provided the most celebrated example. Some officials had credited the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policing tactics with turning the once-edgy city into a remarkably safe one. But when the city ended stop-and-frisk under judicial and political pressure, crime continued to drop.\n\nAs soon as crime began rising, however, citizens' appetite for experimentation evaporated. In New York, voters elected a mayor whose major selling point was his experience as a police officer, and who promised a tougher tack on crime-notwithstanding the enigmas around the city's safety wave. Voters in San Francisco and Los Angeles, who had elected avatars of the \"progressive prosecutor\" movement in 2019 and 2020, have now launched campaigns to recall them . In San Francisco, the recall vote is June 7, and polling suggests that District Attorney Chesa Boudin will lose. As my colleague Annie Lowrey writes , there is a persuasive argument that Boudin \"simply isn't good at the job,\" but the dominant case against him-that he has made the city more dangerous-is questionable; in fact, there's evidence that his policies might improve safety in the long term, but voters are antsy now. (In another sign of the national mood, Republicans placed demagogic attacks on Judge Kentanji Brown Jackson's sentencing record at the heart of her confirmation hearings to the Supreme Court this spring.)\n\nVoters have rejected or reversed changes to police departments too. Although Los Angeles and Portland embarked on high-profile reductions in police budgets in 2020, both cities restored and increased funding in the face of rising murder rates. In Minneapolis, voters not only rejected a poorly thought-out proposal to replace the existing department with a new Department of Public Safety, but also ejected two incumbent city-council members who backed it. In Atlanta, city leaders who were quick to fire a reform-minded chief of police also forged ahead on a plan to build a massive police-training facility derided by activists as \"Cop City.\"\n\nReformists have not been stopped everywhere. Austin embarked on a full overhaul of its department and police academy that has attracted national attention (and escaped punishment from state lawmakers, so far). Many cities, such as Durham, North Carolina , are experimenting with new alternative-response programs. Larry Krasner, the progressive prosecutor in Philadelphia, survived a reelection campaign against a rival backed by police unions. Overall, however, there is no question that reform momentum has ebbed.\n\nAnnie Lowrey: The people vs. Chesa Boudin\n\nA continued retreat from reform is not certain. If crime levels off or drops, perhaps Americans will be ready to consider reform again. Maybe another horrific case like Floyd's will reawaken anger, though the successful prosecution of officers involved in his death might give the impression that sufficient accountability exists. But as I warned when Officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murder in April 2021, individual prosecutions remain too rare and too narrow to produce serious shifts in the American system. Another danger is that a return of brutal policing tactics will drive down crime. The Princeton sociologist Patrick Sharkey has argued that now-abandoned methods can be effective at reducing crime, but unsustainably and at a great cost in justice. That means tough-on-crime tactics now might \"work,\" as measured in numbers, but wound the nation.\n\nBeyond policing, major overhauls to the justice system, such as reducing the world's highest incarceration rate, would require citizens to accept less punitive approaches, such as allowing even people guilty of heinous crimes to eventually leave prison, as the journalist Adam Gopnik has written . The speed with which the national mood shifted from more incremental reforms back toward increased security doesn't suggest that the American people are anywhere near prepared to take those steps."

Let's turn to debate moderator Kristen Welker of NBC .\n\nKRISTEN WELKER : Mr. President, you've described the Black Lives Matter movement as a \"symbol of hate.\" You've shared a video of a man chanting \"white power\" to millions of your supporters. You've said that Black professional athletes exercising their First Amendment rights should be fired. What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Well, you have to understand, the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter, they were chanting, \"Pigs in a blanket,\" talking about police - pigs, pigs, talking about our police. \"Pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon.\" I said, \"That's a horrible thing.\" And they were marching down the street. And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter. I thought it was a terrible thing. As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people. I am the least racist person in this room.\n\nKRISTEN WELKER : Well, what do you say to Americans who are concerned by that rhetoric and by the videos?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : I don't know. I mean, I don't know what to say. I got criminal justice reform done and prison reform and Opportunity Zones. I took care of Black colleges and universities. I don't know what to say. ...\n\nJOE BIDEN : Abraham Lincoln here is one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history. He pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one. Started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he's getting rid of those \"Mexican rapists.\" He's banned Muslims because they're Muslims. He has moved around and made everything worse across the board. He says to the - about the Proud Boys, last time we were on stage here, he said, \"I tell them to stand down and stand ready.\" Come on. This guy has a dog whistle about as big as a foghorn.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're joined right now by Rashad Robinson, spokesperson for Color of Change PAC .\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! , Rashad. Your response to what they're saying there and overall to the debate?\n\nRASHAD ROBINSON : You know, I mean, I think one of the things, that when these conversations happen about race, we oftentimes sort of hear a whole bunch of disparities, or we hear candidates trying to talk about what they're going to do for the community. And, you know, that, I think, is helpful to some extent, but I think that what we're oftentimes seeing - I think what I hope we can see more from the Democrats is actually really leaning into how racial justice is not just about what you're going to do for the community. Racial justice is also a strategy about how we actually win on the wide range of things that we can win on, from healthcare to climate to so much more, because part of the problems of why we don't have the things that we need in this country is because of systems set up around racial inequality.\n\nAnd so we shouldn't just follow the ball that Donald Trump lays down about sort of the sort of racism that's at the heart of his campaign, some of the sort of racial enabling and racism that's at the heart of the Republican Party. We know all of that. What are we going to actually do to motivate people not just to hate Trump, but to love the other side in return? I think that's going to be the ongoing task, not just about winning elections. It's about governing. It's about having the power to actually overcome the barriers that oftentimes stand in the way of moving us forward on the issues that impact sort of the climate around race, that impact Black and Brown communities every single day.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about COVID when it comes to the African American community, when it comes to communities of color all over this country, the disproportionate effect?\n\nRASHAD ROBINSON : Yeah, I mean, I think that this is part of, I think, the challenge of how we need to unlock the power of racial justice, right? So, when we talk about COVID , we will hear folks say Black folks are dying. But, in fact, Black folks are being killed by government action, by corporate power, by an insurance industry. When we talk about the structural issues that impact Black communities in a passive voice, rather than an active voice, we spend all of our time talking about how do we fix Black people and Black families, rather than fixing the structures that harm and hurt as. I mean, we do this across the board, whether it's saying Black people are less likely to get a loan from the bank, instead of actually saying banks are less likely to give loans to Black people. And so, when we talk about COVID , it's not that COVID , the disease itself, is racist. It's that America is racist, and the structures and the systems that we have set up have simply exposed all these challenges.\n\nBut when we talk about these problems in a passive voice, when we talk about these things like it's just happening to the community, not that the poverty and inequality and racism is part of a manufactured structure, that there's corporate power and other systems at every turn benefiting from the sort of impact of these decisions, then we end up sort of really focused on treating communities like they are vulnerable rather than actually treating communities like they've been targeted, attacked, exploited. It actually leads us to a very different set of solutions when we talk about the structural problems in an active voice rather than a passive voice, because when we talk about it in an active voice, we actually focus on solving the problems at hand rather than trying to fix people.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to talk about, for a moment, the debate moderator. Kristen Welker is the first woman of color, the first African American woman to preside over, to moderate a presidential debate since Carol Simpson did in 1992. And at every turn in these last weeks, President Trump went after her viciously, tweeting against her. Yesterday he released the 60 Minutes interview before 60 Minutes released it. He was interviewed by Lesley Stahl and then walked out of it. And he attacked Lesley Stahl. And then he said, and Kristen Welker is even worse.\n\nRASHAD ROBINSON : Yeah, I mean, you know, and then you saw him on stage sort of playing and saying nice things to her before and after. This is the showman, right? This is Donald Trump. I mean, and I think part of what we have to recognize is all the ways he's been able to do this his whole career. I saw a clip going around yesterday of sort of an interview that he had with Connie Chung years ago, and then the things that he said about her afterwards, right?\n\nThis is a president that got here because so many folks enabled him. He was on NBC's platform, on Celebrity Apprentice , once a week, with corporate sponsors, while he was going around the country spreading a racist conspiracy theory about President Obama and was allowed to continue to have that platform. And when that happens, we sort of lower the standards of what's acceptable and create sort of a situation where some of these things are just allowed as acceptable part of the debate.\n\nBut the thing I want to say about the debate moderator, Kristen Welker, is that I think that she really leaned in in a way that we did not see in the last debate. I think she followed up. She really used the opportunity to press both candidates on the issues and try to get them to answer the question.\n\nAnd for folks who are activists out there listening, for people who have been showing up to protest and showing up to raise their voice, whether it's online or offline, in this moment, I think activism was on the stage in a very interesting way. And I think that's important, because we haven't had town hall meetings. We haven't had the sort of opportunities to question the candidates up front, for those moments for immigrant activists and BLM activists and others and climate activists to press the candidates in forums that were sort of more open.\n\nBut on that stage, I think what you saw was Kristen actually pushing these candidates as a result of the larger activism in the space, the way that the conversations and movements on the street have actually changed the dialogue. And whether it was the first debates that we saw on the Democratic side, where you saw a whole new set of issues being talked about, from reparations to racial injustice to white supremacy, for the first time on a presidential debate, I think back to being in middle school during that Carol Simpson debate, and probably the first debate I watched at home with my family, really coming off of getting to understand and learn about the presidential debate when my parents in 1988 gave some of our vacation money to Jesse Jackson's presidential run, and I think about how far some of these conversations have come, how far we are at talking about these issues.\n\nAnd I think what's going to be important, if Joe Biden becomes the president, is that we recognize that we can't mistake the presence of our issues on debate stage for the power to actually change the rules. And we're going to have to press and push and challenge and build power. And for folks who are out there, they're going to have to invest in Black and Brown infrastructure to actually channel that energy, so that we get the type of change that makes people's participation valuable and over the years can be a force multiplier for more people to want to participate in our democracy because they see the result of the type of change that participation brings about.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go to debate moderator Kristen Welker of NBC .\n\nKRISTEN WELKER : Crime bills that you supported in the '80s and '90s contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession. They are sons, they are brothers, they're fathers, they're uncles, whose families are still to this day, some of them, suffering the consequences. So, speak to those families. Why should they vote for you?\n\nJOE BIDEN : One of the things is that in the '80s we passed 100% - all 100 senators voted for it - a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs. It was a mistake. I've been trying to change it since, and particularly the portion on cocaine. That's why I've been arguing that, in fact, we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense. They should be going into treatment, across the board. That's what we should be spending money on. That's why I set up drug courts, which were never funded by our Republican friends. They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem; they should be going into treatment. Treatment. That's what we've been trying to do. That's what I'm going to get done, because I think the American people have now seen that in fact it was a mistake to pass those laws relating to drugs. But they were not in the crime bill.\n\nKRISTEN WELKER : OK. Sir?\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : But why didn't he get it done? See, it's all talk, no action, with these politicians. Why didn't he get it done? \"That's what I'm going to do when I become president.\" You were vice president, along with Obama as your president, your leader, for eight years. Why didn't you get it done? You had eight years to get it done. Now you're saying you're going to get it done. Because you're all talk and no action, Joe.\n\nJOE BIDEN : We got a lot of it done.\n\nKRISTEN WELKER : Your response?\n\nJOE BIDEN : We released 38,000 -\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : You didn't get anything done.\n\nJOE BIDEN : We got 38,000 prisoners left from the - out of -\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : You got nothing done.\n\nJOE BIDEN : Thirty-eight thousand prisoners were released from federal prison. We have - there were over a thousand people who were given clemency. In fact, we're the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern and practice of police departments and what they were doing, how they were conducting themselves. I could go on. But we began the process. We began the process. We lost an election. That's why I'm running, to win back that election and change his terrible policy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, there's Joe Biden and Trump, Trump taking on the crime bill. Rashad Robinson, if you can respond?\n\nRASHAD ROBINSON : It's just so much misinformation and disinformation. I think this is part of the challenge that organizations like mine have in sort of parsing this through, where Donald Trump is somehow trying to make himself an advocate for criminal justice reform or even drug reform, when we know his history and even how the First Step Act came about.\n\nI'm not here to defend the Democrats on criminal justice reform. I'm here to say that they are the party that we have the best chance of pushing to do the right thing. They're the folks most likely to be nervous about disappointing us on this issue. But both parties have a lot of work to do. And that is without false equivalencies.\n\nI think the thing that's important here is that Biden, Joe Biden, and his campaign are acknowledging the flaws and the problems in previous decisions about how they dealt with drug policy, about how they dealt with criminal justice, acknowledging on the stage last week that the '94 crime bill was a mistake. And I think that that is important. That's a representation of a lot of pushing, challenges from those outside and inside of the campaign.\n\nAnd now we need to see that translate into the type of energy and heat necessary to actually make changes on those things, and the type of changes that are not just sort of the cosmetic changes that stop the bleeding, but actually the type of changes that restore people's lives and dignities, that have been stolen, for them.\n\nYou know, we have drug laws on the books that are just simply designed to target and exploit Black people, and it starts all the way down with marijuana, that is essentially legal for rich people and for white people in this country, and we still see Black and Brown people being locked up, all the way up to all the disparities in other drugs. It has failed. It has not worked. And we actually have to build systems of harm reduction, systems that actually allow for people to have the things that they need and people to have the privacy in their lives that they need, as well.\n\nBut I do think that is a fundamental change in the conversation and the debate. But I do think, once again, you've got this sort of showman in Donald Trump that's willing to say anything. And he's trying a very interesting dance on the stage - on one hand, making these deep appeals to law enforcement, on the other hand, trying to make these appeals to Black men at the same time - and doing it in ways that sort of can be confusing and complicated, but because he's such a showman, sometimes it can get over.\n\nAnd that misinformation and disinformation about where he actually stands on the issue is part of why we have to continue to challenge. But it's also why the Democrats can't just make this about hating Trump. They also have to continue to fight and build and put out the policies that are going to change lives and remove barriers and systems that have stood in people's way.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Rashad Robinson is spokesperson for Color of Change PAC . When we come back, we'll also be joined by Erika Andiola, the immigrant rights activist, and get her response to the issue raised of the 545 immigrant children in this country - where are their parents? - that the Trump administration separated from them. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

He most likely would have spent less than five years behind bars. Joe Biden correctly labeled the prosecutions as partisan and politically motivated. \"Hunter was singled out only because he is my son,\" Biden said. With the simple stroke of a pen, President Biden saved his son from a terrible ordeal. Before he leaves office, he should extend the same compassion to thousands of people in federal prison, victims of the so-called war on drugs.\n\n\"This is definitely an opening for folks to talk about exactly how expansive we can use the pardon power of the president to make sure that we're correcting the injustices that were done over the past 20 or 30 years when it comes to cannabis crimes,\" Jason Ortiz, director of strategic initiatives at the Last Prisoner Project, said on the Democracy Now! news hour. \"President Biden himself was actually one of the architects of the 1994 crime bill that created a lot of the outrageous sentences that we're now dealing with today.\"\n\nOrtiz was referring to the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which Biden championed as a senator, and which accelerated mass incarceration. Udi Ofer, former Director of the ACLU's Justice Division, wrote in 2019, on the crime bill's 25th anniversary, \"Under the leadership of Bill Clinton, Democrats wanted to wrest control of crime issues from Republicans, so the two parties began a bidding war to increase penalties for crime, trying to outdo one another.\"\n\nDemocrats have largely accepted the failure of the 1994 crime bill. In 2015, former President Bill Clinton admitted, \"The problem is, the way it was written and implemented, we cast too wide a net. We have too many people in prison.\" While campaigning for president in 2019 and 2020, though, Joe Biden repeatedly denied that the law he helped write contributed to mass incarceration.\n\nJason Ortiz continued, \"There are over 3,000 federal cannabis prisoners currently incarcerated [who] also have families and have parents and loved ones...So, while I can understand why the president wants to have compassion for his own son, we're really frustrated that he's refusing to extend that compassion to all the parents currently watching their kids waste away in prison.\"\n\nOn October 6, 2022, President Biden issued a blanket pardon for those convicted federally for simple marijuana possession. The Justice Department explained then, however, that \"conspiracy, distribution, and possession with intent to distribute are not pardoned by the proclamation.\"\n\nThe goal of The Last Prisoner Project is to expand the relief from the drug war's draconian sentences to those convicted of distribution and other charges.\n\n\"Right now, we have folks serving decades for trafficking,\" Ortiz said, \"exactly what the hundreds of legal cannabis businesses across the country are currently doing on a regular basis, including in Washington, D.C. We're seeing people sitting in prison for decades for the same activity that is currently generating tax revenue for cities and states across the country. We're paying for schools and building bridges with cannabis dollars, but still letting folks waste away in prison.\"\n\nThe Last Prisoner Project is not alone in calling for clemency. Last month, as President Biden prepared to pardon turkeys as part of an annual Thanksgiving photo op, more than fifty members of Congress sent a letter urging Biden to use the pardon power to address the ongoing crisis of mass incarceration.\n\n\"The United States represents just 5% of the world's population, yet we hold more than 20% of the global prison population,\" progressive Minnesota Congressmember Ilhan Omar said at a news conference announcing the letter. \"Over 1.9 million individuals are currently incarcerated with a disproportionate impact on communities of color. Black men are incarcerated at more than five times the rate of white men, a legacy of systematic inequalities that have persisted for generations...President, Biden has a real opportunity to make a difference in these final days of his term, we are calling on him to act.\"\n\nHunter Biden will very likely never see the inside of a prison cell, nor experience the discrimination and indignities imposed on former felons. President Biden has the power to pardon thousands of people imprisoned for federal cannabis crimes, or commute their sentences to time served and allow them to return home. The power is in his hands, but he still needs to be pushed by the millions of citizens in whose name he wields it.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Activists shouted, \"Black youth are not super predators\"-a reference to Hillary Clinton's 1996 comments about some youth. They also held signs reading \"Clinton Crime Bill Destroyed Our Communities.\" In response, Bill Clinton defended Hillary Clinton's use of the term \"superpredators\" and accused the activists of defending criminals.\n\nBill Clinton : \"Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute. OK, I heard it. Can I answer? See these other signs? This is what's a matter. I don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out onto the streets to murder other African-American children. Maybe you thought they were good citizens. She didn't. She didn't. You are defending the people who killed the lives you say matter.\"\n\nThis comes as Hillary Clinton is facing an increasingly tough challenge by Bernie Sanders in the New York primary on April 19."

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nScholar Michelle Alexander made headlines last week when she wrote a critical post about Hillary Clinton's record on criminal justice issues. \"I can't believe Hillary would be coasting into the primaries with her current margin of black support if most people knew how much damage the Clintons have done-the millions of families [that were] destroyed the last time they were in the White House thanks to their boastful embrace of the mass incarceration machine and their total capitulation to the right-wing narrative on race, crime, welfare and taxes.\" We look back at Clinton's record with three guests: Darnell Moore, a member of the New York City chapter of Black Lives Matter; former Vermont Governor Madeleine Kunin; and former NAACP President Benjamin Jealous.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Darnell Moore, you're with Black Lives Matter. The group has said they're not going to endorse a candidate. Why not?\n\nDARNELL MOORE : So, to begin, I think it's important to talk about the New Hampshire primary and its intended purpose. So, what happens, typically, a media-you know, a candidate who comes out of this as a winner can get a media boost and also more money for their campaign. In so many ways, the New Hampshire primary is sort of critiqued for its ability to too easily give the impression that there is general consensus around a candidate. So, given that, it behooves us to not give so easily an endorsement off of an illusion, in so many ways. It's clear to think about who represent-who's in New Hampshire. It's primarily white. It's primarily rich. And it sort of skews towards an older-like the average age is about 42 percent [ sic ]. That's not nearly representative of many of the folk who are taking to the streets in this movement for black lives.\n\nBeyond that, I think it's really important to give candidates the space to come around and really amplify and break down the issues that are germane to the Black Lives Matters movement. That happened as it related to private prisons, with Hillary Clinton's turn in October 2015. But people want the candidates-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What do you mean, her turn?\n\nDARNELL MOORE : Well, the private prison-the sort of speaking out against private prison and the corporate backing of prisons that happened in October 2015. But Black Lives Matter organizers want candidates to be clear about their positions, not just rhetorical, but in terms of policy and in ways that they expect for these things to take material reality.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And so far, among the Democratic candidates, what is your sense of some of the issues that the Black Lives Matter movement has been most involved in, especially changing the culture and the practice of policing in America? How have they been responding?\n\nDARNELL MOORE : So, one of the things I think is important to note is that here is an iteration of a movement that squarely placed its critique on the state. This is about state-sanctioned violences of many types. And it makes sense to me why it is that folk would be resistant to not only providing endorsement, but to supporting the state and anyone representing it, when the state is actually the object of critique.\n\nBut there are issues beyond policing-so, policing, overcriminalization and policing in communities; environmental health concerns, like in Flint, Michigan; unemployment; undocumented status of people of color. There are so many other areas that are of concern that haven't actually been sort of spelled out and broken down by candidates in ways that speak to the needs of Black Lives Matter organizers.\n\nI should also say, you have to remember that this is a multigenerational movement. There are people who are on the streets and involved in this movement who were there in '96 when the Welfare Reform Act was passed. They were there in 1994 when the Violent Crime Act was passed. They have a sense of how Clinton had a part in the doing-in proliferating and spreading a lot of the problems that we're talking about now. And then there are some who may have lacked that political consciousness, who's coming to it now.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go back to 1994, what you're referring to, Darnell, when Hillary Clinton appeared on C- SPAN to back the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act.\n\nHILLARY CLINTON : We keep going. With respect to the crime bill, I think as more Americans focus on the fact that this bill would have put more police on the street, would have locked up violent offenders so they never could get out again, would have given more prison construction money available to the states and as well as the federal government, but also would have dealt with prevention, giving young people something to say yes to. It's a very well-thought-out crime bill, that is both smart and tough. I think Americans are going to say, \"Why these political games? Why are we once again letting certain special interests call the shots in Washington?\" And we will eventually get a good crime bill, like the president has proposed. It will just take a little longer than it should have.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Hillary Clinton back in 1994. I wanted to turn to Michelle Alexander, the author of The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness , who recently wrote on her Facebook page, quote: \"If anyone doubts that the mainstream media fails to tell the truth about our political system (and its true winners and losers), the spectacle of large majorities of black folks supporting Hillary Clinton in the primary races ought to be proof enough.\" She said, \"I can't believe Hillary would be coasting into the primaries with her current margin of black support if most people knew how much damage the Clintons have done-the millions of families that were destroyed the last time they were in the White House thanks to their boastful embrace of the mass incarceration machine and their total capitulation to the right-wing narrative on race, crime, welfare and taxes.\" Governor Kunin, can you respond to this?\n\nMADELEINE KUNIN : Happily, I will respond. I mean, you may recall that before Barack Obama was elected, Bill Clinton was called \"the first black president.\" I think the Clintons have a long history of support for civil rights. And they understand the South, since he was born in Arkansas, and Hillary, early in her youth, fought for civil rights. Her basic training in politics came from Marian Wright Edelman, the Children's Defense Fund. She has been there, and she's not a recent spokesperson for Black Lives Matter. She went to Flint, Michigan, yesterday, giving up a day in New Hampshire, just to emphasize the point that in this largely black community it's an outrage that the water has been poisoned. So, I think, you know, she's been there, and he's been there, and their commitment should not be questioned. Sure, there are laws that have been passed that have been detrimental. But she is for prison reform. We have to look at both the past and the present. And the same goes true for other issues. You know, when-she's been voted the most admired woman in the world, year after year, because people respect her. People will remember the words, \"Women's rights are human rights, and human rights are women's rights.\" And she's helped people of color in every country. So, she's not a newcomer; she's been tested. Her-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, let me-\n\nMADELEINE KUNIN : The question, really, between the two is: Who can make it happen? Who can really make change happen? And I'm reminded of Aesop's fable, \"The Tortoise and the Hare.\" She may be the tortoise, and it may be a female tortoise, but she's going to get us there.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Governor Kunin, I wanted to ask you, in terms of Bernie Sanders, you've mentioned, one, that he's not newcomer on the political scene. He's been in public life now for 35 years. And you also mentioned that when he ran against you, he ran against as an independent who basically said that both parties were useless, or Tweedledum and Tweedledee, as he referred to them. Could you talk about that and the change now as he's running in the Democratic primary?\n\nMADELEINE KUNIN : Well, he's obviously grown up a lot. And he's a more-you know, his basic message has more resonance today than it did in 1986. But he was so focused, like a laser beam, on income inequality that he did not want to be distracted by either the women's movement or the environmental movement. He thought that the elites were involved in these movements. So he's come a long way, and I give him credit, frankly, for raising the issue of income inequality and campaign finance laws as they now exist. He's made that a major part of the conversation of this campaign.\n\nWhere I differ from him is: How are you going to make it happen? How are you going to get it done? And I think that experience matters. And let's face it, it's tougher for a woman to be the first woman president of the United States and, in some sense, an influence in the whole world. She gets criticized either way. Either she's too tough and too masculine, or else she's too feminine and can't be commander-in-chief. Somehow, she has to find that sweet spot between being strong enough to be commander-in-chief and feminine enough to be mother of the nation. A guy doesn't have to walk that tightrope in quite the same way.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to-I wanted-\n\nMADELEINE KUNIN : So, I think she-yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to bring in Ben Jealous to go back to this point that Darnell Moore originally raised, that Michelle Alexander wrote about, and that is the issue of the prison pipeline, about the Clinton years around crime, the 1994 crime bill, and your assessment of this.\n\nBENJAMIN JEALOUS : Yeah, look, you know, it's really hard, you know, to hear the name of Marian Wright Edelman raised to vouch for Hillary Clinton being consistent on race, because the reality is that at that time, in addition to what we saw, which is her speaking the talking points of the prison guards' lobby, we also saw her come out-Hillary Clinton-in the support of the superpredator bill-excuse me, the superpredator idea, to use the-to invoke the idea of superpredators to push for these crime bills. And the superpredator idea was this notion that a child at age six months could be such a sociopath as to be beyond redemption. And it's a violation of theology, it's a violation of basic psychology. It was never used, as far as I know, to describe anyone white. It was always used sort of to describe young black men as a mass. And it made life very tough for us. And it helped push in bills, quite frankly, that have led to the biggest spike in the incarceration of women that we have seen-of, typically, black women. But black women's lives matter, too.\n\nAnd that's the tough part here, because, you know, you want to believe she can get things done, but then you see, on these criminal justice issues, in 2008, she was the only Democrat on stage who took the Republican position of saying that if we reduced the disparity between crack and powder sentencing-crack sentencing affects mostly blacks; powder, mostly whites-that there would be no retroactivity. And that was locking up mostly women, nonviolent drug addicts, who should have been in rehab, and keeping them from their children. Now, this year, she's the only Democrat on stage, back when there were three, who supports the death penalty, again taking the Republican position. So I don't disagree with the governor. There are some things that she'll be able to get done-simply because she'll capitulate. But the reality is that nobody says that the Republicans can't-that their idealists can't get things done. And game recognizes game. We need our idealists there, so that when they compromise, it's an actual compromise.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're going to break, then come back to this discussion. Ben Jealous with us, former head of the NAACP ; Madeleine Kunin, joining us from Burlington, Vermont, the first woman governor of Vermont; and Darnell Moore of Black Lives Matter-they have not endorsed anyone. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Joe Biden's disastrous legislative legacy.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Former Vice President Joe Biden has entered the 2020 race for the White House, becoming the 20th Democrat to seek the nomination in the largest and most diverse field of Democratic candidates to ever run for president. Biden will hold his first fundraiser tonight in Philadelphia. It will be hosted by Comcast's chief lobbyist, David Cohen.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In a campaign video released on social media this morning, Biden took aim at President Trump's response to the 2017 \"Unite the Right\" march of white nationalists in Charlottesville. He began by talking about Charlottesville, the home of Thomas Jefferson, and then went on to talk about what happened most recently.\n\nJOE BIDEN : It was there in August of 2017 we saw Klansmen and white supremacists and neo-Nazis come out in the open, their crazed faces illuminated by torches, veins bulging, and bearing the fangs of racism, chanting the same anti-Semitic bile heard across Europe in the '30s. And they were met by a courageous group of Americans, and a violent clash ensued. And a brave young woman lost her life. And that's when we heard the words of the president of the United States that stunned the world and shocked the conscience of this nation. He said there were, quote, \"some very fine people on both sides.\" \"Very fine people on both sides\"? With those words, the president of the United States assigned a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it. And in that moment, I knew the threat to this nation was unlike any I had ever seen in my lifetime.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : That's Joe Biden announcing his run for president. As a longtime senator from Delaware, Biden has run twice before for the Democratic nomination. The last time was in 2008, when he ultimately became then-Senator Barack Obama's running mate. Biden's third bid for the presidency comes in a Democratic political climate that is notably more progressive than the last time he sought the nomination.\n\nBiden will face scrutiny for his long and checkered record in the coming weeks, including his 1994 crime bill that helped fuel mass incarceration with financial incentives to keep people behind bars. Biden has also long faced criticism for his handling of Anita Hill's sexual harassment allegations against Supreme Court justice nominee Clarence Thomas in 1991. At the time, Biden was the chair of the Senate Judiciary committee. Biden is also known for close ties to the financial industry, notably helping push through a 2005 bill that made it harder for consumers to declare bankruptcy. According to The New York Times , the credit card issuer MBNA was Biden's top donor from 1989 to 2010.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : One of Biden's key legislative achievements was the 2005 bankruptcy law that made it harder to reduce student debt, preventing most Americans from claiming bankruptcy protections for private student loans. He also voted to authorize the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. In the weeks before Biden announced his bid for the presidency, at least seven women stepped forward to accuse him of inappropriate touching.\n\nWell, last month, I spoke with Andrew Cockburn, Washington editor for Harper's magazine, about Biden's potential run for the presidency and his recent piece headlined \"No Joe!\" \"Joe Biden's disastrous legislative legacy\" was the subtitle. I began in Part 2 of this discussion by asking Andrew Cockburn about Biden's role in the 1994 crime bill.\n\nANDREW COCKBURN : He teamed up with Strom Thurmond, this sort of very aged, old segregationist from South Carolina, you know, really the face of-the face of everything that we'd been trying to get away from. And it was really, you know, Joe-he thought this was going to really propel him to the top. As he said to a former aide, who told me-I think it was around about 1990-the aide was telling me how he, Joe, was always trying to hold hearings on crime and drugs. Every week, his poor staff had to sit around dreaming up a new excuse for a hearing on crime and drugs. And as Biden said to his staffer, he said, \"I want when people hear the words 'crime' and 'drugs,' I want them to think 'Joe Biden.'\" I mean, he was really running, you know, like a-like George Bush Sr., on a sort of Willie Horton. You know, it's astonishing that this man, this politician, should be considered a front-runner for the Democrats.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Now, could he simply say he's changed since then, that he's completely reversed his position?\n\nANDREW COCKBURN : Well, not really. I mean, he sort of-he's flubbed on a few things. I mean, he changed-you know, he's apologized for a few things-not, I note, on busing; not on choice, where his record is truly terrible. He has said that he's kind of sorry, a bit sorry, about his crime legislation. And he said he's sorry he voted for the financial deregulation, the key repeal of Glass-Steagall. He said that was the worst vote ever-ever of his entire career, which I'm-there's a lot of competition there. So, but even if-you know, just thinking of his political viability, supposing he has to go through the campaign saying, \"Well, I'm sorry I did what I did on busing. I'm sorry I did what I did on crime. I'm sorry I did what I did on banks,\" he's going to sound like another shifty politician.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And on Anita Hill, \"I'm sorry what I did on Anita Hill\"?\n\nANDREW COCKBURN : And Anita Hill, \"I'm really sorry about Anita Hill.\" He's expressed some regret for that, I should admit. So, you know, basically, his record has very little that's good about it. You know, he has his sort of shtick of being the friend of the working man, but, you know, he's been a much better and closer friend of the financial industry.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about what happened with Neil Kinnock, the speech.\n\nANDREW COCKBURN : Well, very bizarre, that. He, Neil Kinnock, who at that time was the leader of the Labour Party, had this standard stump speech.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In Britain.\n\nANDREW COCKBURN : In Britain, yeah, British Labour Party. And he would-in his stump speech, he would say that, you know, he was-why was it that he was the first Kinnock in a thousand years to go to college, and Mrs. Kinnock, he invoked, too, as being the first from her family to go to college. And he made a moving sort of rags-to-riches sort of piece out of that. And Biden-Biden heard this, or his speechwriter did, and thought, \"That sounds good,\" and simply substituted the word \"Biden\": \"Why am I the first Biden in a thousand years to go to college?\" and so on, so forth. And, well, what's particularly ironic about it is that Neil Kinnock was known in Britain as the \"Welsh windbag,\" because he went on and on. And, of course, Biden himself is a terrible windbag. So, it was really bizarre to have one windbag plagiarizing another.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to talk about Iraq. In 2002, former chief U.N. weapons inspector in Iraq, Scott Ritter, said, quote, \"Sen. Joe Biden is running a sham hearing. It is clear that Biden and most of the Congressional leadership have pre-ordained a conclusion that seeks to remove Saddam Hussein from power regardless of the facts, and are using these hearings to provide political cover for a massive military attack on Iraq. These hearings have nothing to do with an objective search for the truth, but rather seek to line up like-minded witnesses who will buttress this pre-determined result,\" Ritter said. That same year, in 2002, Senator Biden said, quote, \"We must be clear with the American people that we are committing to Iraq for the long haul; not just the day after, but the decade after. ... I am absolutely confident the President will not take us to war alone,\" he said. Talk about the significance of that then, and then what it could mean for today.\n\nANDREW COCKBURN : Well, it fits into Biden's, you know, worldview, or, well, behavior on the international stage, throughout, which is as, you know, a very hard-line hawk. You know, as you just said, or as Ritter said at the time, Biden was really doing everything he could to assist George Bush in the run-up to the illegal invasion of Iraq. You know, on the Foreign Relations Committee, he summoned just pro-invasion witnesses. As far as I know, he was certainly not one of the famous of the five senators who took the trouble to go down and read the National Intelligence Estimate, that Senator Bob Graham has talked about, which was locked away down in the basement, which would have told them that there was a lot of doubts in the intelligence community as to whether Saddam had weapons of mass destruction and so forth. No, he just-he wanted-you know, he was all for war, and he was all for occupation, as you said.\n\nAnd that fits in with, you know, his record since, most notably as vice president. Obama made him, made Vice President Biden-gave him really the-well, the Iraq file, but also the Ukraine file. And Biden used that to be an ardent proponent of, you know, more arms for Ukraine, for intervention in what is really a civil war in Ukraine. Of course, his family-his son-had very extensive business ties in Ukraine, which doesn't look too good. His son Hunter was on the board of the Ukrainian gas company. So, you know, Biden, whenever he's been given the chance, he's been for armed intervention. He was ardently for the expansion of NATO , the post-1990-in the 1990s, which, you know, is really the root cause of the renewed-sort of the new Cold War. I mean, Biden was there. It's no surprise that he describes John McCain as his best friend in the Senate.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Biden also said, in 2002, \"I do not believe this is a rush to war; I believe it's a march to peace and security.\" So, Andrew Cockburn, if you could comment on his two runs for president, both failed? You know, all the media is saying the polls show he's the-you know, number one now, followed by Bernie Sanders. But, of course, he's got the biggest name recognition nationally. He was vice president for eight years under President Obama.\n\nANDREW COCKBURN : Well, that's right. I mean, it is largely a factor of name recognition. But also, I mean, we have to think about those two runs. And what it showed-first of all, there was, as we've discussed, this astonishing gaffe in 1988, where he wasn't just plagiarizing this British politician, by the way. It turned out that his speeches also had extensive passages lifted from Robert Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, and Martin Luther King, unbelievably. So, you know, it's kind of-it's hard to explain this really sort of mental issue. But then that sank his-it's not clear that his campaign was going anywhere, anyway, at that time.\n\nAnd then, in 2008, you know, he didn't even have that excuse of a plagiarism. I mean, he made an astonishing remark about Barack Obama early on, where he described him as \"clean.\" I mean, it was a very sort of racist-almost racist-sounding, patronizing remark. And he got nowhere. You know, he really sputtered in his campaign, sputtered and died.\n\nSo it's pretty bizarre to me, this sort of-this cheering squad for Biden: you know, \"Run, Joe! Run!\" And I think, actually, what you-clip you showed, featured, of him at the firefighters' convention yesterday, was very telling, because sounded like I can hear Donald Trump invoking, you know, low energy again. He didn't sound like a, you know, ready-to-go politician at all to me. He sounded sort of rather weary. I have the feeling sometimes that he-in his heart, he doesn't want to do it. That's why we've had this sort of Hamlet performance for months now. And the people around him, all these longtime aides, this is their chance for, you know, a ticket in the big game, to be in on a big-time presidential campaign, and they're kind of pushing him into it.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but I think, you know, if he does run, those poll numbers will come down in a hurry. He's not an effective campaigner. He hates preparation. He hates like debate prep. He's not a great fundraiser. He doesn't like having to sort of kowtow to big donors to get money. He's got such an inflated ego. I really think that he is not-I'm not the only person saying this; people who've known him for a long time think the same-that he would really-what he really wants is to be anointed-you know, \"Please, Mr. Biden, please come and be our candidate. Please come and be our president\"-without having to go through the hard grind, the incredible exhaustion, of a modern presidential campaign.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Andrew, could you talk about the media's coverage of him? You are really among the first, if not the first one, in this period, to start really seriously analyzing Joe Biden's record as a senator and then as a vice president. Then the rest of the media started, well, repeating some of what you had to say.\n\nANDREW COCKBURN : Well, yes. So, thank you. That's kind. But that is true. But, I mean, the pack-you know, now they're all busy at work, like CNN digging out that very damning clip you played earlier. And there's going to be a lot more of that. I mean, already there's things I didn't know that are coming up. And just imagine what it's going to be like when he has 12 other Democrats, you know, sort of chasing him around the ring. It's going to be like Lord of the Flies or something. It's, you know, the people-you know, oppo researchers can be pretty good these days, and there's a lot to come out.\n\nAnd he has-you know, he has so many deficiencies as a candidate, including, I should say, because the Republicans are already saying it, a \"me, too\" problem. I mean, if you look on sort of Republican websites and Twitter accounts, there's a montage going around of Joe Biden with women at photo ops, including some quite young women-children, really-you know, apparently fondling them. I'm sure it's all very just avuncular and everything, but as one person, one political fundraiser and operative, said to me-a lady said, \"I was never talking to him when he wasn't stroking my back.\" You know, he's very tactile, which, I'm sure, is entirely innocent. But, you know, don't think that the Republicans won't make a lot of lot of hay with that, and probably his Democratic rivals, too.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's Andrew Cockburn, Washington editor for Harper's magazine. To see Part 1 of our discussion, go to democracynow.org.\n\nWhen we come back, we look at a New York Times exposé detailing how Navy SEALs, who witnessed their platoon chief, Eddie Gallagher, commit war crimes in Iraq, were encouraged by their superiors not to speak out, and told they could lose their jobs for reporting him. Gallagher goes on trial for murder next month. We'll speak with New York Times journalist Dave Philipps. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

On Thursday, activists in Philadelphia disrupted a speech by former President Bill Clinton, who was campaigning on behalf of Hillary Clinton. The activists called out the Clintons for their support for the 1994 crime bill, which led to a massive expansion of incarceration in the United States, and Hillary Clinton's 1996 comments that some youth were \"superpredators.\" In response, Bill Clinton defended Hillary Clinton's use of the term \"superpredators\" and accused the activists of defending criminals. We speak to Melina Abdullah, an organizer with Black Lives Matter in Los Angeles. \"[Bill Clinton] is very good at ... distracting us from how systems create these conditions,\" says Abdullah. \"They act as if the young folks who wind up committing crimes ... as if they weren't human beings. This term 'superpredator' dehumanizes our children.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We are on the road as part of our 100-city tour , now in Los Angeles, California. The Black Lives Matter movement continues to shake up the race to the White House after former President Bill Clinton said Friday he regretted his comments to black protesters at a rally in Philadelphia the day before. Black Lives Matter activists had interrupted Clinton during a speech in support of his wife, Democratic presidential candidate, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. They challenged the Clintons on their support for the 1994 crime bill, which led to a massive expansion of incarceration in the United States. Activists shouted, \"Black youth are not superpredators!\" a reference to Hillary Clinton's 1996 comments about some youth. They also held signs reading, quote, \"Clinton Crime Bill Destroyed Our Communities.\" In response, Bill Clinton defended Hillary Clinton's use of the term \"superpredators\" and accused the activists of defending criminals.\n\nBILL CLINTON : I don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out onto the street to murder other African-American children. Maybe you thought they were good citizens. She didn't. She didn't. You are defending the people who killed the lives you say matter. Tell the truth. You are defending the people who caused young people to go out and take guns. There was a 13-year-old girl in Washington, D.C., who was planning her own funeral. ...\n\nI talked to a lot of African-American groups. They thought black lives mattered. They said, \"Take this bill, because our kids are being shot in the street by gangs.\" We had 13-year-old kids planning their own funerals. She doesn't want to hear any of that. You know what else she doesn't want to hear? Because of that bill, we had a 25-year low in crime, a 33 low in the murder rate, year low rate, murder rate. And listen to this: Because of that and the background check law, we had a 46-year low in the deaths of people by gun violence. And who do you think those lives were, that mattered? Whose lives were saved, that mattered?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : After his comments ignited a storm of controversy Thursday, Bill Clinton spoke Friday and elaborated on what he said. But he stopped short of apologizing.\n\nBILL CLINTON : So, I did something yesterday in Philadelphia I almost want to apologize for, but I want to use it as an example of the danger threatening our country, because the founders set this country up so that we could keep growing and being bigger and including more people, but we would always have to come together to make a decision that would move us forward. ... We got a 25-year low in the crime rate. We got a 33-year low in the murder rate. We got a 46-year low in the illegal death by homicide rate. I think we showed that lives matter to us. I think it was good. But that is not how people see it 30 years later, when they just see all these young people who need to be out of jail. I get that. But we've got to get the show on the road. We can't be fighting our friends. We've got enough trouble with the people that aren't for us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : President Clinton's comments come as prosecutors here in Los Angeles are determining whether to retry six Black Lives Matter activists whose trial recently ended in a hung jury. The six face misdemeanor charges for barricading the 101 freeway in Los Angeles in November 2014, the action in response to the non-indictment of former Ferguson, Missouri, police officer Darren Wilson in the killing of Michael Brown three months earlier. Activist Rosa Clemente was also tried, but she was acquitted. Supporters say the prosecution is part of a larger effort by the LAPD and City Attorney's Office targeting Black Lives Matter activists in Los Angeles.\n\nFor more, we're joined here in Los Angeles by two guests. Nana Gyamfi is a criminal defense and human rights attorney who represents Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles, professor of Pan-African studies at California State University, Los Angeles. Also with us is Melina Abdullah, an organizer with Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles, also professor and chair of Pan-African Studies at California State University, Los Angeles.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Let's begin with you, Melina Abdullah. Respond, before we talk about the trial, to this-what happened with President Clinton last week, when Black Lives Matter activists interrupted his speech, what he said.\n\nMELINA ABDULLAH : Right. Well, I think that what we're seeing with President Clinton-former President Clinton and what we're seeing in Los Angeles are actually linked, so this idea of neoliberal politics kind of blaming the folks who it assails for their own oppression. And so, when we think about the initial comments by President Clinton around black youth and those who got them, quote-unquote, \"hopped up on crack,\" I think what he's really neglecting is the policies that bring crack cocaine into inner cities in the first place, the policies that create unemployment and underemployment in the first place, and then the policies that he initiates, that then go ahead and further oppress and repress communities. And so, that is one of the things that we're so upset about, that he is dehumanizing the communities that are actually the victims and bear the brunt of neoliberal policies that keep us oppressed.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : After calling for unity on Friday, former President Bill Clinton continued to defend the 1994 crime bill he passed, which led to a massive expansion of incarceration in the United States.\n\nBILL CLINTON : You're living in a country where young African Americans think their number one threat now is from police officers. When I signed that crime bill, they knew what their number one threat was. It was from gangs making money out of cocaine, taking teenage kids, hopping them up, giving them guns and telling them to go kill other teenagers.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Your response, Melina Abdullah, as he talks about gangs and why exactly he did what he did in the 1990s?\n\nMELINA ABDULLAH : Right. So, as one who was coming of age myself in the '90s, as one who lived in East Oakland, a space where these kinds of conditions that he describes were really part of my everyday experience, one of the things that he is very good at, and neoliberal politicians are very good at, is kind of distracting us from the real issues, distracting us from how systems create these conditions. So they act as if the young folks who wind up, you know, committing crimes committed crimes because they simply were out of control, committed crimes as if they weren't human beings. So this term \"superpredator,\" again, dehumanizes our children, dehumanizes our people. And so, it acts as if we're behaving in ways that are not simply as a result of the conditions that we experience.\n\nAnd so, we need to turn the tables and look back at policymakers; look back at systems that create oppressions in the first place, that create hollowed-out communities where there are no resources, where there are no livable-wage jobs, where there are no after-school programs; look at the policies of the Clinton administration rolling back the kinds of resources that I would have benefited from, and many of my peers would have benefited from, in kind of moving forward. And so, rather than looking at so-called 13-year-old superpredators, which, you know, we know is a term that's used for black youth-this is dog-whistle politics, right?-we need to look at policies that don't provide the resources that we need, that began in the '90s but continue to today. So the crime bill is another example of it, right? So, we're blaming people for being in prison, we're blaming people for being poor, we're blaming people for not having access to resources, when we're not looking at the policymakers themselves who create the conditions that hold back resources from communities.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to turn to a clip of Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders speaking at the Apollo Theater in Harlem on Saturday. He was asked about Bill Clinton's defense of Hillary Clinton's use of the word \"superpredator.\"\n\nSEN . BERNIE SANDERS : I think we all know what that term meant-\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER 1: Yes.\n\nSEN . BERNIE SANDERS : -when-in the context that it was said years ago. We know who they were talking about.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER 2: Right, black people.\n\nSEN . BERNIE SANDERS : That's exactly right. That's who it was. And I think that the president owes the American people an apology for trying to defend what is indefensible.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Bernie Sanders at the Apollo Theater in Harlem with Harry Belafonte, who's come out in support of Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator. Melina Abdullah, what Bernie Sanders said?\n\nMELINA ABDULLAH : It is absolutely indefensible. That said, we're not looking for an apology from Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton, who is now seeking our vote. Right? We're not looking for apologies from them. What we want is substance. So we want substantive responses. We want responses that are actually empowering to communities. We want it recognized that our children are not superpredators. We want it recognized that there is something that can be done to then kind of shift what it is we're doing with our resources and with our policies, to be empowering to communities and be in conversation with communities. I think what's most disturbing is that when we talk about superpredators, when we talk about 13-year-old children as not being children, it also signals a kind of policymaking agenda that seeks to advance the interests of big business, of white supremacist, patriarchal, heteronormative capitalism-the existing hegemony-as the primary agenda that needs to be addressed, without engaging the communities that are most in need of progressive and really kind of forward-thinking transformational policy work.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And yet, in this election, as a number of newspapers point out, no group has been more loyal to Hillary Clinton than the African-American community.\n\nMELINA ABDULLAH : Well, I think the black political class has lined up behind Hillary Clinton, because they see neoliberalism as an alternative to Trump. Right? But the truth is, we really need to kind of think and be more imaginative. We really need to think about what do we really want, not just what do we not want. So we know we absolutely don't want a Trump, but it doesn't mean that Hillary or neoliberalism, as a kinder, gentler face on oppression, is good for communities, either. And so it's really important that we understand that we can move things forward by engaging in work on the ground.\n\nAnd so, the last time that I was with you, we talked about how Black Lives Matter is not endorsing any political candidate. And I think that what's happening around Clinton, the Clintons, and what's happening just in terms of what's kind of bubbling up from the two-party system is an indicator of why we're not endorsing any of the candidates, including Clinton. And I think that what we're also seeing is a divide between the political class, who tends to behave pragmatically within a two-party system, and what's happening with the working class and the people who are really kind of bearing the brunt of neoliberal policies, saying that we're not enthused about any of the candidates, including Clinton. So I don't hear a whole lot of enthusiasm on the ground in my neighborhood.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Melina Abdullah, I want to thank you for being with us, organizer with Black Lives Matter, professor and chair of Pan-African Studies at California State in Los Angeles. When we come back, we'll talk about a Black Lives Matter case that was just wrapped up and where it goes from here. Are the LAPD , the Los Angeles police, spying on Black Lives Matter activists? Then we'll talk about Japanese internment, as Republican candidates call for a barring of Muslims in this country and surveillance of the Muslim community. We go back in time and look at the Japanese interment, how it happened. Could it happen again? Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

As his term draws to a close and amid outrage over the pardon of his son Hunter, advocates are pressuring Biden - who has pardoned thousands who had been convicted of federal drug charges but were not incarcerated at the time of their pardons - to grant clemency to thousands more who are still in prison over cannabis offenses. The president has a chance to atone for his past support of \"tough on crime\" measures, says the Last Prisoner Project's Jason Ortiz.

But the president's decision has also brought renewed attention to the power of the presidential pardon. Biden is now facing renewed pressure to commute the sentences of death row prisoners and to pardon or grant clemency to political prisoners like Indigenous leader Leonard Peltier, imprisoned in Florida, and the whistleblowers Edward Snowden and Julian Assange. The group Last Prisoner Project is calling on Biden to use his clemency power to free those still incarcerated in federal prison for cannabis crimes.\n\nWe're joined now by Jason Ortiz, director of Strategic Initiatives at the Last Prisoner Project.\n\nThis is very interesting, Jason. I think they say that Hunter Biden has been clean for something like just over five years. His father has openly talked about his son, formerly an addict. And as he faces bipartisan criticism, talk about what you think this is an opening for.\n\nJASON ORTIZ : Sure. So, this is definitely an opening for folks to talk about exactly how expansive we can use the pardon power of the president to make sure that we're correcting the injustices that were done over the past 20 or 30 years when it comes to cannabis crimes. President Biden himself was actually one of the architects of the 1994 crime bill that created a lot of the outrageous sentences that we're now dealing with today.\n\nAnd so, we're seeing that there are over 3,000 federal cannabis prisoners currently incarcerated on cannabis charges, and these are all folks that also have families and have parents and have loved ones. And we have examples, like folks like Jonathan Wall, who is somebody that was a Maryland resident. He was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for his first offense. And so, while I can understand why the president wants to have compassion for his own son, where we're really getting frustrated is that he's refusing to extend that compassion to all the parents that are currently watching their kids waste away in prison. Mitzi Wall, who works with the organization Freedom Grow, is the mother of Jonathan Wall. She was joining me this past week when we had the congressional press conference, when we were joined by folks like James Clyburn, Congressman James Clyburn, asking for freedom and clemency for folks like Jonathan Wall. And so, that's one example of 3,000 folks that are currently in prison.\n\nSome of the charges are far more egregious. Folks like Edwin Rubis was sentenced to 40 years in federal prison in the '90s. And so, he's someone that hasn't had a Christmas or holidays with his family. He has a son that's 27 years old. He has currently served 27 years of that federal sentence. He hasn't had a single Christmas with his son because of charges that were orchestrated and architected by President Biden, then as senator, in the crime bill. We have folks that are serving life sentences. Ismael Lira, for a trafficking charge, is currently sentenced on a life sentence for the same activity that is now legal across the country in 25 -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Which is what?\n\nJASON ORTIZ : - different states, including - trafficking. And so, that would be the distribution of cannabis. And so, there is a specific differentiation between what President Biden's previous pardons were intended to do, which was only covering things like simple possession, where right now we have folks that are serving decades for trafficking, which is exactly what the hundreds of legal cannabis businesses across the country are currently doing on a regular basis, including right in Washington, D.C. And so, we're now seeing people sitting in prison for decades for the same activity that is currently generating tax revenue for cities and states across the country. We're paying for schools and building bridges with cannabis activity dollars, but still letting folks waste away in prison. And so, while I can definitely understand why a father would want to have compassion for his son and avoid prison time for his son, we're really asking him to extend that same compassion to all the folks that he helped put in prison to begin with.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: [Jason], you mentioned the previous pardons for simple cannabis possession, but that hasn't led to the release of many of those incarcerated individuals. Can you talk about that?\n\nJASON ORTIZ : Yeah, absolutely. So, those pardons were for simple possession, for folks that were currently charged on a federal possession charge. And, now, it is very rare for someone to actually serve prison time for a simple possession charge at the federal level. That generally happens to folks - somebody maybe got caught; they were smoking at a national park or some other sort of federal property where they were unaware of it. But there are nobody in prison for simple possession in the federal prison system whatsoever. So, despite his pardoning of 6,000 charges, zero people were released.\n\nHowever, the charges that we're looking to actually have folks released for, things like cultivation of cannabis, sales of cannabis, those are the charges that folks are currently in prison for. And we want him to expand his use of the pardon to cover all cannabis crimes that are now legal in the majority of the country.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, and, Jason, apologies, but, Jason, during your press conference last week, you spoke of, quote, \"the heartbreaking number of Latino fathers incarcerated for life or near-life sentences.\" How do these cases reflect systemic inequalities in federal sentencing?\n\nJASON ORTIZ : So, we've seen for the past 50 years or so that the war on drugs has been racially motivated, specifically targeting young Black and Brown men, and many of those are Latinos, here in the city of New York. There was millions of arrests across the country. We've seen countless young fathers that have been ripped from their families, simply because they were trying to make money to help feed their families.\n\nAnd so, I was somebody who was arrested in high school at the age of 16. I was lucky enough not to get incarcerated, but only because my parents were able to help me through this ridiculous legal process of keeping a 16-year-old out of prison.\n\nAnd so, we're seeing across the country that while these laws are changing, the retroactive relief and the restorative justice for the folks that were impacted has not followed suit with all of the cannabis profits that we're seeing developed across the country. And we know without a doubt that the war on drugs was and is still racially motivated, specifically targeting Blacks and Latinos. And so, we've yet to actually wrestle with that real racist history of the war on drugs. We're simply trying to just move on without addressing the past.\n\nAnd I think the president has an incredible opportunity now to really address the issues that have been developed over the last few years by taking real expansive action, using his clemency power to commute the sentences of the folks that are currently in prison. And roughly half of the folks that are on our list of constituents are Latino. And you can see very clearly just by looking down the list of names who is in there and who is getting out in the future. And Latinos are definitely overrepresented in the prison population generally, but especially in the federal system for cannabis crimes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, if you look at the clemency statistics by president, Biden is at almost the lowest, outside of George H.W. Bush. Biden, Trump, Obama, W., Clinton, H.W. and Reagan - he's number two, among the lowest. Are you speaking directly, are your groups speaking directly with the Biden clemency office? How far are these demands going? You're talking about thousands of people.\n\nJASON ORTIZ : Yeah. So, we have met with White House officials multiple times, and we've explained exactly the folks that we believe are the top candidates for clemency. And while they have been receptive, they have not told us that they're going to take any particular action to help these folks out at all.\n\nAnd so, what we are really doing is hoping that they will take action sooner rather than later. It is true that most of the time most presidents use their clemency powers at the very end of their presidency. However, President Biden has clearly shown that he's not going to wait for everyone to wait until the end of his presidency. He was willing to do it a little bit earlier for his son. And so, we're asking him to extend the same grace and compassion to all the folks that are currently incarcerated and release them immediately, let them join their families for the holidays, let them see their families grow up, and bring joy and happiness back into their lives.\n\nThese are folks that have served a tremendous amount of time already. This is not folks that we're saying did not commit the crime and should be, you know, released without any sort of punishment. Folks like Edwin Rubis have already served 27 years of their life in federal prison for a cannabis charge.\n\nAnd so, while he could wait, we are asking him not to wait, to do this immediately, to show the people that his presidency is going to be one where he will be remembered as addressing the issues that he created and coming to this from a place of compassion, and not continuing the process and continuing the damage done by punitive drug policies.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Jason Ortiz, we thank you so much for being with us, director of strategic initiatives at the Last Prisoner Project.\n\nComing up, Israeli journalist, former conscientious objector Haggai Matar about Gaza and Israel's crackdown on the press. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "Democratic Voters Shrug Off Joe Biden's Role In 1994 Crime Bill\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nSenior Reporter and Polling Editor, HuffPost\n\nCHARLESTON, S.C. ― Joe Biden has gotten a lot of flack for his support of the 1994 crime bill , his signature legislative achievement in the Senate that has been blamed for an increase in the U.S. prison population.\n\nBut evidence suggests the decades-old law will be less of an issue for him as he continues to lead the race for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2020 election .\n\nExperts say the sprawling legislation, signed into law by President Bill Clinton, contributed to both a decline in crime and an increase in mass incarceration. It expanded the federal death penalty and created dramatically harsher sentencing laws, including a three-strikes provision that mandated life terms for people with at least three federal violent crime or drug convictions. It also gave states incentives to lock criminals up for longer periods of time and provided billions in funding for new prisons.\n\n\"Good people signed on to that bill. People make mistakes. But let's hold them to that,\" Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), a 2020 rival, said in an interview with HuffPost last month. \"That crime bill was shameful, what it did to black and brown communities like mine [and] low-income communities from Appalachia to rural Iowa. It was a bad bill.\"\n\nBiden has continued to defend the law, telling voters last month there were \"a lot of the good things in the bill\" (it also contained a ban on assault weapons and the initial version of the Violence Against Women Act). He said it \"did not generate mass incarceration.\"\n\nBiden's defense of the law doesn't appear to be costing him support among African Americans, though. In South Carolina, where over 60% of Democrats are black, Biden holds a commanding 20-point lead over the rest of the crowded primary field, according to a recent poll .\n\nAsked if he faulted Biden for his role in getting the 1994 crime bill through the Senate, Lee Moultrie, a black civil rights activist from Charleston, South Carolina, said, \"Hell, no.\"\n\n\"People made decisions based on the time,\" Moultrie said. \"You can't come back 20 years later and say, 'OK, you shouldn't have done this.' The information they had led them to make some decisions that they made. Now, we might see it might not be effective as we wanted it to be, and that it created some problems that we didn't want to have, but we have to give that a pass.\"\n\nStanding in line to see several candidates address black economic issues at a presidential forum in Charleston over the weekend, Moultrie, who remains undecided in the election, argued that African American leaders and community members share some responsibility for not working harder to stop the law at the time.\n\n\"The black elected officials could have stood up. Everyone who had some concern, where were they at? The black fraternities, the black sororities, they could have stood up,\" Moultrie said. \"You can't blame one person or the Congress, because you could be advocating against something if you don't like it.\"\n\nThe law was backed at the time by the Congressional Black Caucus as well as several big-city black mayors and clergy leaders who were alarmed at soaring crime rates across the country.\n\nSonya Fordham, a schoolteacher from Charleston who also attended the forum, said that Biden's time in the White House as Barack Obama's vice president outweighed his involvement with the 1994 crime law.\n\n\"I think people do change. Politics does make you change. This country is about change,\" Fordham said, after stating her 2020 preference for Biden first and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) second. \"I think that he did a lot for me when he was No. 2 for Obama.\"\n\nShe added: \"It takes a lot for a white man to be second, OK? And that says a lot to me, right there.\"\n\nAnother undecided voter, an African African man at the forum who identified himself only as Robert, also said Biden's role in passing the '94 crime bill shouldn't bar him from the 2020 presidential nomination. But he did suggest that Biden ought to make clear where he stands now.\n\n\"I can't fault the man for what he believes in,\" Robert said.\n\nWhile black voters in South Carolina were generally willing to give Biden a pass, some in Iowa said they would take the crime bill into consideration with other factors when making their choice for the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"He's an interesting guy. He's got a long history,\" said Anthony Arrington, a 50-year-old black man who runs a professional and executive search and consulting firm in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. \"Question is, is he somebody that people who look like me can trust? I think it comes down to trust. I'm not sure yet. But I think he's very knowledgeable.\"\n\nStanding outside the Iowa Democratic Hall of Fame celebration on June 9, Arrington said he's considering voting for Biden, but he's also interested in Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, and Cory Booker.\n\n\"As much as I appreciated his [Biden's] work under Obama, if I look at his body of work, and I go back to the crime bill, I go back to his sudden reversal on Hyde, you question: Is it politics or not? But that's with everybody. That's with everybody, but that's a fair thing to think about.\"\n\nThe specifics of the crime bill, a new HuffPost/YouGov survey suggests , aren't on many Democrats' radar. Although 55% of Democratic voters say they're at least somewhat familiar with the 1994 bill, just 1 in 10 are very familiar. Although their views about it are roughly split ― 28% approve, and 31% disapprove ― the largest bloc is the 41% who aren't sure either way. Even among those who do hold an opinion on the bill, slightly less than one-fifth say it's an issue that will be very important to their vote next year.\n\nMany voters aren't aware of which candidates were backers of the bill in 1994. (Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) voted for the bill when they served in the House). Given a list of some of the top-polling Democratic candidates to choose from, just 30% of Democratic voters picked Biden as being among those who initially supported the crime bill, and only 12% named Sanders.\n\nBut the polling also gives a sense of just how much Americans' way of thinking about crime may have shifted since the bill was passed more than two decades ago, and how unpopular a law-and-order approach is within the Democratic Party today.\n\nAlthough the polling methodology is too different to allow for direct apples-to-apples comparison (among other things, the HuffPost/YouGov survey is conducted online, and gives respondents an explicit option to say that they're unsure about questions), the results do suggest a fairly significant shift away from punitive measures. In a 1994 NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, Americans said, 58% to 29%, that better law enforcement and stricter punishment would be more effective in reducing crime, rather than more education and training to create better economic opportunities. In the HuffPost/YouGov poll, Americans favor education and training, 49% to 31%. Within the potential primary electorate, three-quarters of Democratic voters say they consider education and training a more effective approach than ramping up law enforcement and cracking down on offenders.\n\nDemocratic voters weigh against three-strikes laws by a considerably more modest margin, saying 42% to 31% that they oppose laws requiring life imprisonment for anyone convicted of three serious crimes, although more than a quarter are unsure.\n\nMaxwell Strachan contributed reporting from Iowa.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Bill Clinton's Other Terrible Crime Bill\n\nImprisoned for 22 years for a crime he didn't commit. Freed July 11, 2017.\n\nElection time is here, and prison reform is now a hot topic. Much of the focus recently has been on the crime bill that then-President Bill Clinton signed in 1994, a law now seen as a driving force behind mass incarceration. Poor Blacks, Hispanics and Whites were the targets. President Clinton sent billions of dollars to state governments to construct more prisons--fueling the prison boom that swallowed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, including juveniles. (Remember the so-called \"super-predators\"?) The Prison Litigation Reform Act, which emerged from a provision in the 1994 bill, shut the door to federal courts for thousands of prisoners seeking to appeal their convictions, weakened court protections, and lowered fees awardable to lawyers in lawsuits concerning prison conditions.\n\nLast week, CNN held the Democratic presidential debate between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. Both candidates supported the 1994 bill at the time -- Sanders voted for it as a Congressman, and Clinton advocated for it as First Lady. When it came to the topic of reforming the criminal justice system, Clinton was pressed on whether she regretted supporting the bill. She said, \"I'm sorry for the consequences that were unintended and that have had a very unfortunate impact on people's lives.\" She had previously expressed regret for using the phrase \"super-predators\" in the 1990s, which Sanders called \"a racist term\" at last week's debate.\n\nBut the 1994 crime bill wasn't the only law signed by Bill Clinton that fueled mass incarceration. In 1996, he signed a another bill that isn't being mentioned: the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). This law stemmed from the Oklahoma City bomber case -- lawmakers wanted to speed up the process of convicting and executing Timothy McVeigh and prevent him from filing appeals. The result was another mass incarceration tool targeting (who else?) the poor.\n\nThe AEDPA, in conjunction with some U.S. Supreme Court decisions, has made it much harder to appeal a state-level criminal conviction in federal court. This has made the law of habeas corpus enormously complicated and challenging. There are landmines at virtually every juncture. Federal courts must now follow strict guidelines regarding the scope and standard of review applied to each case. Therefore, litigants must know the standard of review pertaining to each issue they raise on appeal. Otherwise, petitioners will, essentially, find themselves running for a touchdown when basketball rules are in effect. As a result of the AEDPA, it's also harder to get evidence of innocence and prosecutorial misconduct before a judge for an evidentiary hearing.\n\nThe AEDPA has been devastating for wrongfully convicted prisoners and their families. Reform is long overdue and very much needed. I know this from personal experience. In 2012, I was judicially exonerated by the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals after spending sixteen and a half years in prison for a crime I did not commit. But after just four months of freedom, the Supreme Court issued a decision under the AEDPA that sent me back to a life-without-parole sentence. I had to start my fight all over again. Although I'm living through a nightmare, I'm also just one of many others. Too many deserving litigants (innocent prisoners) have been unfairly denied review and relief due to unreasonable procedural hurdles established by the AEDPA.\n\nThe late Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter -- exonerated in 1985 -- once told President Clinton that, had the AEDPA been law when he was in court, he would still be in prison on a wrongful conviction for life!\n\nWho suffers the most? Innocent prisoners. The last two years have both seen record numbers of exonerations: 137 in 2014 and 149 in 2015. But these numbers have not even scratched the surface; there are many other wrongfully convicted people still in prison. What's really needed -- reform? Or the total overhaul of our criminal justice system?\n\nLorenzo Johnson served 16 and a half years of a life-without-parole sentence until 2012, when the Third Circuit Federal Court of Appeals ruled there was legally insufficient evidence for his conviction. He remained free for four months, after which the US Supreme Court unanimously reinstated the conviction and ordered him back to prison to resume the sentence. With the support of The Pennsylvania Innocence Project , he is continuing to fight for his freedom.

      "text": "President Bill Clinton Gets It Wrong On Mass Incarceration\n\nLos Angeles Attorney, Emmy Nominated Producer 'Freeway Crack in The System' Documentary\n\nPresident Bill Clinton doubled down on his 1994 Crime Bill , pulling back from his recent apology for his role in the over incarceration of young African Americans. Instead, today he labeled these youth in similar fashion to his wife's description 20 years ago, as a type of predator that leads to people being \"hopped up on crack.\" Mass incarceration has largely been the type of stain on the Clinton legacy with Black Americans that doesn't wash out with words. Clinton's bill has left in its wake a trail of devastated African American families cut off from loved ones that have served sentences for nonviolent drug offenses that were decades too long. For former President Bill Clinton to now insinuate that Black Lives Matter protestors are defending murderers and gang leaders, is offensive to a people that have been through so much due to his legislative actions. Yet, here we stand in 2016 hearing the same rhetoric espoused to create the Crime Bill, now being used to justify its abhorrent results. Where as in 1996 Hillary Clinton called young blacks super predators, that is now replaced with Bill Clinton saying,\n\nI don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out into the street to murder other African American children -- maybe you thought they were good citizens.\n\nHillary Clinton's statements calling inner city black youth, \"super predators who must be brought to heel\" was a line of thought built to create unfounded paranoia about urban youth back in the 1990s.\n\nThis super predator myth that was debunked long ago is now revived by President Bill Clinton in 2016, recycling the same racial stereotypes. Bill Clinton's attempt to blame African American politicians for the Crime Bill he championed to prove he could be tougher on crime than the Republicans as part of his New Democrat strategy is historically inaccurate. President Clinton, this is your legacy; own it as you do the economic gains Hillary Clinton has touted throughout her campaign. While African American politicians facing communities devastated by the results of Reganomics and the crack epidemic were desperate to deal with violent crime leading to their support of many tough-on-crime measures. They did not foresee the results of your policies, being that large parts of their communities would be placed in prison, and stripped of welfare.\n\nToday there are more African American men incarcerated in the U.S. than the total prison populations in India, Argentina, Canada, Lebanon, Japan, Germany, Finland, Israel and England combined. These nine countries in total represent over 1.5 billion people, in contrast, there are only 18.5 million black males in the United States, counting children.\n\nSo what do the Hillary Clinton supporters say now when the mistakes of 20 years ago rush forward, not as a page that has been turned, but rather as a core part of the Clinton ideology on blacks in the ghetto? As a producer of the documentary Freeway Crack in the System , I have seen firsthand how the criminal justice system worked during the crack era. It wasn't unbiased, nor was it fair. It definitely wasn't as simplistic as it was described by President Clinton today. It was actually loaded with agendas, and economics in ways many who were targeted could never imagine.\n\nThe epicenter of the incarceration era Clinton referenced in his statement above, roots itself in the crack cocaine epidemic, and mandatory sentencing laws that followed. Yet, to truly look at the era of mass incarceration, we must dig deeper than Gary Webb's accusations in Dark Alliance the expose that brought to light the CIA's involvement in cocaine trafficking. Only by looking at the United States of America with honest eyes, being cognizant of cycles of actions, can we see Gary's tangled web for its true light. Through this analysis of President Clinton's Crime Bill and the like, we are lead to a larger understanding of black America's historical arch in the United States, and a deeper view into how it weaves into the fabric of present day realities. Those realities include the stories of Eric Garner, Mike Brown and so many others that have dealt with the secondary consequences of mass incarceration's hold on our country.\n\nOver the course of three years myself and several other producers took on the task of delving into the War on Drugs and Iran Contra Scandal as we created the film Freeway Crack in the System . Crack in the System was an in-depth detail into how our nation followed this path toward the incarceration of so many in such a short period of time. As a former prosecutor, I have seen the system up close and understand its impact on lives. In this film, we journeyed from the epicenter of the crack epidemic in South Central Los Angeles to the Nicaraguan City that started the domino effect that led to America's cocaine explosion. The connection between the two cities was an administration headed by President Ronald Reagan that,with one hand, turned a blind eye to Nicaraguan drug suppliers trafficking large-scale cocaine in the United States, and with the other reformed the American incarceration landscape with the implementation of harsh crack cocaine sentencing for American citizens who bought and sold some of the same drugs far down the supply line. All of this was done while the government contemporaneously allowed for the privatization of U.S. prisons that would hold this flood of new inmates.\n\nAs stated in our film by Eric Sterling, one of the drafters of the Anti Drug Abuse act of 1986, who apologizes on camera for writing some of the most draconian prison sentences ever created for a nonviolent drug offense.\n\nI knew that these laws were a mistake when we were writing them... There is no question that there are tens of thousands of black people in prison serving sentences that are decades excessive... Their families have been destroyed because of laws I played a central role in writing.\n\nAccording to Sterling these laws were written based on a hysteria created by crack cocaine's imagery in the media. Furthermore, he had not seen a law prior, or since, implemented in such a way. Police agencies were not surveyed, drug scientists were not consulted, this was not a law that was guided by logic. Young blacks were convicted and sentenced based on emotion and fear.\n\nThe economic backdrop that set this in motion cannot be ignored. Throughout the two terms of Reagan's presidency, economic advancement declined in urban centers across the country. Decreased access to job opportunities as a result of globalization moving manufacturing jobs to international markets, limited availability of government programs and an implementation of trickle-down economics by Reagan hit African Americans with a devastating impact. This was the frame for the picture that became President Bill Clinton's masterpiece of a Crime Bill. Economic genocide of a community by governmental policy had led to the creation of urban ghettos mired in poverty. President Clinton's claim that black poverty and unemployment declined under his presidency is only partially true, it overlooks the fact that incarcerated people don't count in poverty and unemployment stats. Skyrocketing incarceration rates created a false impression of higher rates of increased employment among black men, by leading those that were incarcerated to be an invisible group behind bars. In addition, the myth that incarceration only increased at the state level fails to deal with the incentives the 1994 Crime Bill created for states to make this action .\n\nSo today, as Bill Clinton addressed protestors and screamed into the microphone for them to let him speak, he forgot that the last time we allowed him to speak, it lead to a type of incarceration the modern world has never seen before.\n\nSo we rather you did not say as much this time.\n\nAntonio Moore is a Los Angeles Attorney.

Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), who has served in Congress for over 20 years, is now apologizing for his role in signing a 1994 crime bill that was detrimental to the urban poor and people of color .\n\nIn an emotional interview on MSNBC on Wednesday, Rush said, \"I am ashamed of my role. I sincerely apologize to my God. I apologize to my community, to my family. That was the worst vote, as I look back on the years.\"\n\n\"Crack cocaine and the crime bill were the two worst issues, problems, catastrophes that the black community has suffered from in the last 15 years,\" the Chicago politician added.\n\nRush explained that his vote on the Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act, which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton, was accompanied by \"a lot of hope\" and he believed the bill would deal with the \"devastating crime.\" He went on to say that the crime bill as implemented had too many resources focused on \"locking them up\" and provided no resources for beneficial programs.\n\nIn 1996, then-first lady Hillary Clinton defended her husband's bill during a routine campaign stop in New Hampshire, telling the nearly all-white crowd about the dangers of roaming gangs of young \" super-predators .\"\n\nMSNBC host Tamron Hall pushed back this week, asking if an apology is enough since Rush has endorsed Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail.\n\nRush said that since the passage of the crime bill he has \"remained consistent\" on advocating for better schools and housing as well as increasing economic development in black communities.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Democrats Are Still Uncomfortable With Bill Clinton's Crime Bill\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nPHILADELPHIA ― Former President Bill Clinton had a chance to grapple with the controversial legacy of his 1994 crime bill during his Tuesday night speech to the Democratic National Convention . He chose not to discuss it.\n\nPolitical conventions are typically celebrations of their participants, not moral investigations or examinations of a party's past failures. And Clinton skipped over plenty of other uncomfortable facts during his nearly hour-long speech, which presented an inspirational romantic history of his relationship with Hillary Clinton and their life in politics together.\n\nBut given the major themes of the evening, the former president's avoidance of the crime bill seemed a particularly bold oversight. The DNC on Tuesday night highlighted eight mothers who had lost children to racially charged violence ― some at the hands of police, others at the hands of civilians.\n\nSybrina Fulton, Geneva Reed-Veal, Lucy McBath, Gwen Carr, Cleopatra Pendelton, Maria Hamilton, Lezley McSpadden and Wanda Johnson all endorsed Hillary Clinton from the convention stage for their own reasons. Their presentation was powerful, touching on both criminal justice reform and efforts to curb gun violence.\n\nBill Clinton's history with these issues is messy . The 1994 crime bill that he signed into law significantly toughened sentencing for both violent and nonviolent crimes, helping to fuel a mass incarceration system that just happened to hit black communities particularly hard. Dozens of crimes became newly punishable by the death penalty.\n\nThe bill also expanded federal funding for police, without meaningful standards to improve law enforcement methods. Critics of the bill say that it placed an emphasis on more policing rather than better policing, and that this, again, harmed black communities.\n\nThe crime bill also included a ban on assault weapons ― a then-new legal term for a variety of semi-automatic guns. That ban expired during George W. Bush's presidency and has never been renewed.\n\nMothers who lost children to civilian guns called for new, tougher gun laws on the stage Tuesday night, and declared their faith in Hillary Clinton to fight for them.\n\nTheir presentation offered the Democratic Party an opportunity to come to terms with its recent history and offer a different path forward during a major party event. Instead, Bill Clinton dodged the issue, calling for young black people to do their part to help build a stronger and safer nation.\n\n\"If you're a young African-American, disillusioned and afraid ... Help us build a future where no one is afraid, including our people who wear blue,\" Clinton said.\n\nThe crime law was Bill Clinton's legislation, but then-first lady Hillary Clinton advocated for it in public, in terms she has said she now regrets . When Black Lives Matter protesters disrupted a Bill Clinton speech in April, however, he defended his wife's use of the term \"super-predator\" two decades earlier.\n\nThere are dozens of other issues that Democrats and the general public now view differently than they did in the 1990s. Not every issue gets airtime. But the DNC didn't bring out foreclosure victims to talk about how Hillary Clinton would crack down on financial fraud, or refugees to praise her foreign policy.\n\nTuesday night revealed that while the Democratic Party is eager to look forward on criminal justice reform, it is still uncomfortable looking back.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Restoring Dignity to Criminal Justice\n\nCEO and President, Prison Fellowship\n\nWhen he signed the 1994 Crime Bill, then-President Bill Clinton called it the \"toughest and smartest crime bill in our history.\"\n\nSince then, the violent crime rate has dropped, but it's not clear that the Crime Bill is responsible. A number of changes -- including improvements in policing, the waning of the crack epidemic, and the aging of America -- also play a part. What is clear is that the crime bill has helped put 2.3 million men and women behind bars, and with millions more on probation or parole, we are the world's leaders in locking people up.\n\nWhy should we care if more criminals are behind bars for longer sentences? As president of the nation's largest outreach to prisoners, ex-prisoners, and their families, I've seen the downsides of mass incarceration up close. People who could safely be returned to the community remain behind bars for years -- at a hefty cost to taxpayers. The 2.7 million children with an incarcerated parent are the most at-risk children in America, subject to depression, anxiety, poverty, home instability, substance abuse, and gang involvement. And the lack of rehabilitative programming leaves the 700,000 prisoners released every year prone to commit new crimes, which means more victims.\n\nLike a football coach who fine-tunes his game plan at halftime, it's time to introduce a more pro-active crime prevention strategy. Without compromising the public-safety gains of the last 20 years, we can focus on bringing good people home -- not just keeping those who break the law locked up indefinitely.\n\nEvery day, former prisoners can and do come home completely renewed and restored, prepared to help build safer communities, and actually be part of the solution to crime. For examples, I need look no farther than my friend Edwin, who came out of prison to build a successful business in Michigan that employs other ex-prisoners, or Tish, a former addict who became a model mother and addiction recovery counselor, and Chuck Colson, who founded Prison Fellowship after serving time in a federal prison. There are countless others.\n\nWe can help create more success stories -- and safer communities -- through policies that respect the human dignity of each life, recognizing that \"criminals\" are not a monolithic group of monsters. They are people, capable of choosing to change and contribute. Some people who commit crimes will choose not to change, and in the interest of public safety, they need to be separated from society. But for those who can be restored, and have paid their debt to society, shouldn't a second chance be possible?\n\nThere are many ways to respect human dignity in the criminal justice system without putting the public at risk. Drug courts, mental health courts, and veterans' courts address the needs of populations best served outside the main criminal justice system, and they do it more cheaply and effectively . By dealing with the complex issues beneath many crimes, like addiction, mental illness, and post-combat trauma, alternative courts help keep new crimes from occurring. The nation's first veterans' court, in Buffalo, New York, had a zero percent recidivism rates in its first few years -- none of its participants committed a new crime . Alternative courts -- aiming for rehabilitation instead of incarceration -- are springing up in states across the country.\n\nWithin the corrections environment, let's bring prisons back to their morally rehabilitative purpose. Prison Fellowship and other volunteer-driven organizations provide proven programming behind bars, addressing criminal thinking and behavior at the root. Innovative corrections officials, like Louisiana's Warden Burl Cain, can also create environments that support life transformation without compromising safety.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

At the federal level, the Second Chance Reauthorization Act, now making its way through Congress, would extend programs that help returning citizens re-integrate into the community through partnerships with state and local government as well as faith- and community-based organizations. Just a couple of initiatives receiving grants from the Second Chance Act include a Texas program for gang-affiliated teenagers, which is helping them stay out of jail (Kathleen A. Fox, Vincent J. Webb, Alejandro Ferrer, Charles M. Katz, and Eric Hedberg, Gang Intervention Treatment Re-Entry Development for Youth (GITREDY): A Report on the First Year of Implementation (Huntsville, TX: Sam Houston State University, 2012), and a mentoring program for mothers being released in Oklahoma, which had a 98-percent success rate at keeping women from returning to prison over a 12-month period (figures are as of September 2013. Recidivism is defined as a return to Oklahoma Department of Corrections custody).\n\nThere are many ways to keep us safe. Our representatives need to know that we support proven alternatives to mass incarceration that help restore individuals, families, and communities. When President Clinton signed the Crime Bill, he commented, \"This is about freedom. Without responsibility, without order, without lawfulness, there is no freedom.\" I would add that there is no freedom without respect for the dignity of each human being. It's time for that respect to be enshrined in the criminal justice system, for all our sakes.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

They reveal the cynicism and callousness of Clinton administration officials - including Rahm Emanuel and Ron Klain, who Biden is considering for his own administration - who shepherded the bill through Congress for naked political gain.\n\nJoe Biden at a town hall meeting in McClellanville, South Carolina, on February 27, 2020.\nJim Watson / AFP via Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAs the incoming Joe Biden administration shapes up, it has already, accurately, been described as the Obama administration 2.0. But that's only half the truth. With many of the Obama-to-Biden picks having cut their teeth a decade earlier, in the Clinton administration of the 1990s, it may be more accurate to describe the next four years as the third coming of Clintonism.\n\nThe prospect of appointing Rahm Emanuel, Bill Clinton's senior advisor for policy and strategy, continues to persist despite the former Chicago mayor's appalling record on race, inequality, and so much more. Bruce Reed, president of Clinton's Domestic Policy Council, continues to wait in the wings for his call-up. And Ron Klain, who served under Clinton in a variety of different roles, has already been picked as Biden's next chief of staff, to the widespread applause of progressives.\n\nWith all three quite possibly (and one definitely) set to serve under yet another Democratic president, it's worth going back to where it all began in Bill Clinton's first term. Thanks to documents available from the Clinton Digital Library and archival collections at the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock, Arkansas, we can get a glimpse inside the political minds set to drive the next four years of Democratic policy-making.\n\nThe most familiar of the policies all three men worked on was the 1994 crime bill, the harsh, take-no-prisoner legislation (literally, in the case of its death penalty provisions) passed during a years-long frenzy to \"convince the public that legislators are tough on criminals,\" as the Washington Post put it . The bill, by putting tens of thousands more police on the streets, billions of dollars more into building prisons, encouraging harsher sentencing laws at the state level, and creating a federal \"three strikes\" sentence, fueled the United States' current issues with policing and mass incarceration . It also became a major issue in the later presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton, whose husband signed it into law, and Joe Biden, who worked with the White House to shepherd it to passage.\n\nBut the damage the bill would wreak on Americans' lives wasn't part of its calculus. Its passage, instead, was motivated entirely by politics, electioneering, and fear of the Right, as laid out repeatedly in memos.\n\nIn early June 1993, Emanuel laid out the thinking and motivation behind the bill to now-ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos, who was then serving as White House communications director and was soon to become senior advisor to the president, and Mark Gearan, White House deputy chief of staff for policy, who was soon to take his spot. The administration, Emanuel explained in the memo, had to \"bridge that gap between the budget and health care\" in its policy agenda.\n\n\"If we do not fill the gap ourselves, it will be inevitably be [sic] filled by issues like gays in the military and abortion,\" he wrote. Crime, he argued, \"could serve as an effective counterweight\" to what he termed those two \"cultural/values-related issues,\" and was one that \"speaks to the general public and presents him as strong and moderate.\" (Biden similarly urged Clinton to \"seize control of the issue\" and rush the bill through to \"maintain crime as a Democratic initiative\").\n\n\"Democrats have a rare opportunity to seize this issue,\" argued a research paper sent to Emanuel just days earlier, drawing on public polling that showed Democrats had an \"edge\" on crime over the GOP for the first time in twenty years.\n\nEmanuel had extremely high ambitions for the crime bill. As he and Reed laid out to Clinton in a February 1994 memo, his goals included \"to cement public perception of you as tough on crime,\" to \"improve the Democratic Party's standing with regard to crime,\" and to \"help House Democrats in particular identify themselves with the issue of crime.\" With midterms and gubernatorial races coming, they argued, its passage would \"have an inevitable ripple effect and will not only benefit your image, but also that of the Democratic Party, which lost almost every major race in 1993 on the crime issue.\"\n\nEmanuel, Reed, and Klain (as well as Stephanopoulos) all ended up on the crime bill working group that would meet every ten days, and they worked closely with Biden in June 1994 on the conference report for the legislation. The collaboration \"has been very successful for us,\" they reported in a memo to White House chief of staff Mack McLarty, managing to fit in all of Clinton's initiatives, including harsher punishments for violent criminals like three strikes and an expanded federal death penalty, and more prisons \"to lengthen sentences for violent criminals.\" In an earlier memo, Klain had laid out the administration's three strikes proposal to then-attorney general Janet Reno, providing her with a list of \"likely questions and answers.\"\n\n\"Won't your proposal lock up geriatrics?\" went one. \"For deterrent purposes, life should be life - we do not want to bet innocent lives on a criminal becoming 'safe' at some specific age (i.e., age 55 or age 60),\" went Klain's suggested reply.\n\nThe memos also show something else: that the argument trotted out by both the Biden campaign and Democratic-aligned news outlets as cover for the law's racist outcomes had little basis.\n\nBoth in 2016 , when the crime bill reared its head in Hillary Clinton's run, and throughout Biden's campaign of 2019-20, news outlets and pundits again and again excused both candidates' roles in the bill by pointing to the backing it got from the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), who supposedly viewed it as \"an imperfect solution to unbearable levels of urban crime.\" As Biden said on the trail, \"The Black Caucus voted for it.\"\n\nBut, as the documents show, the CBC's unhappiness with the bill was one of the administration's chief obstacles to getting it passed, and Klain, Emanuel, and Reed spent months figuring out how to get the caucus's support without making any meaningful concessions. This was made particularly complicated by the Racial Justice Act (RJA), a provision in the crime bill slipped in to make its harsher measures more bearable.\n\nThe RJA would have allowed those being put to death to challenge and even block the carrying out of their sentence if they could show that, statistically, the death penalty was being applied in a racially discriminatory way. Klain and the rest of the administration feared it would lose them support for the bill from some senators, from district attorneys, and from attorneys general from death penalty states (while noting that they had the support of some from non-death penalty states).\n\nHaving fretted from the beginning that the GOP would look for ways to divide Democrats \"along racial and ideological fault lines,\" they feared the RJA would frame the bill as a \"dispute about racial justice.\" Biden himself pushed for its exclusion, telling Klain and other staffers that the bill would be successfully filibustered if it stayed in.\n\nOn the one hand, as a May 1994 memo from the three men stated, leaving it out would \"give us a product easier to defend from Republican attacks.\" On the other, there were perils with this approach, as Klain and Pat Griffin, assistant to the president for legislative affairs, laid out to Clinton before ultimately pursuing that strategy. \"This course will produce severe [emphasis in original] damage to our relations with the CBC - which is already incensed about the Crime Bill's 'tough' provisions,\" they wrote. \"This damage is almost certain to have long-standing political and legislative ramifications.\" They passed on the warnings of House leaders, that dropping it \"will produce large-scale conflict with the Congressional Black Caucus\" and bleed voters from liberals and the CBC.\n\nThis wasn't a one-off fear. In a later July memo , Emanuel and Klain floated that \"if CBC resentment of the absence of racial justice is a firestorm, they could keep the bill deadlocked in Conference for some time.\" Two weeks later, owing to the fact that \"some members of the CBC feel very strongly that the CBC should not support the crime bill\" because \"the CBC has not been shown proper respect by the administration,\" Clinton's staff set up a call with the caucus to persuade them to vote for it anyway.\n\nHow did they convince them? The talking points fed to Clinton for the CBC call included not just the single sentence, \"We need this bill for the kids,\" and that support from black mayors meant \"they will not be alone,\" but fear of the GOP: \"If they throw all this away, there is a very good chance the Republicans will offer a bill in October with all the tough measures and none of the preventive measures - and there is no way we will be able to defeat that bill just before the election.\" If it went down, according to the talking points, \"the bill won't move further to the left, but rather, inevitably - as we get closer to an election - further to the right.\"\n\nThe exact policy details of the crime bill, for all the ways they would be used to tear American communities apart in subsequent years, were sometimes an afterthought for those involved. Take habeas corpus reform, the measure pushed for years by Biden and finally passed in an unrelated bill two years later, which aimed to severely limit federal death penalty appeals. The measure one conservative judge would later call \"a cruel, unjust, and unnecessary law that effectively removes federal judges as safeguards against miscarriages of justice\" was, for Klain, just one more speed bump to roll through on the way to getting a bill on the president's desk.\n\n\"Our goal should be to get a fast and plausible resolution of this troublesome issue, and move ahead on a Crime Bill that advances those matters that are at the heart of your anti-crime agenda [emphasis in original],\" Klain wrote in June 1993 . \"Thus, we should be looking for the resolution that gets us out of this issue as quickly and simply as possible.\" Klain urged Clinton to adopt the version worked out between Biden and prosecutors, which barred multiple appeals and put a six-month time limit on them.\n\nOr take what was, for Clinton, the bill's most important provision: one hundred thousand new police on the street. Upon being informed in 1997 that, due to waning interest at the local level, that number may not ever actually be deployed, Klain wrote back : \"Well, of course, this was just an arbitrary goal that some campaign guys set. And besides, America doesn't really need the police.\"\n\nNeeded or not, the American people got them, and Emanuel got the game-changing piece of triangulation he had been after. The crime bill's impending passage, he wrote in August 1994, was \"one of the best things we have been able to do to both the president and Democratic candidates in '94,\" and would \"change the political environment in which candidates are running.\" Its signing \"should be seen as the beginning of a campaign through the November elections,\" he wrote.\n\nInstead, only two months after Clinton signed the crime bill into law, the Democrats suffered a historic drubbing , losing the House, the Senate, a net ten governor's mansions , and control of twenty state legislative chambers.\n\nThe story of the 1994 crime bill is a well-worn one, including its role in producing, under Clinton's watch, \"the largest increases in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history,\" in the words of the Justice Policy Institute .\n\nThe point isn't to relitigate what's now widely acknowledged as a terrible piece of legislation, but to look at what revisiting its creation can tell us about the men set to, for the third consecutive time, play leading roles in a Democratic administration.\n\nThe memos reveal the callousness and cynicism involved in the pursuit of power for its own sake, with Klain in particular casually justifying state brutality in service of a political win. They show a group of people so concerned with political attacks from the Right that they would gladly sacrifice human lives and even relationships with loyal allies to their left. And they remind us of the moral and political bankruptcy of this approach, whose failure to secure for the party the one single thing that justified in their minds all manner of overreach - electoral victory in the short term - wouldn't stop that strategy or its progenitors from being tapped again and again to lead the country, including today.\n\nAfter an exhausting year, millions of Americans are hoping for a new administration that will make a sharp break from what came before. You can't help but feel you've heard this story once or twice before.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

The 1994 Crime Bill and its expansion of mass incarceration was his crowning achievement.\n\nFormer vice president  Joe Biden speaks to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs on November 1, 2017 in Chicago.

With Beltway insiders and Democratic bigwigs talking up his presidential chances, the former vice-president looks to be the candidate to beat in the 2020 primaries.\n\nThe only problem is, it's Joe Biden. If you thought Hillary Clinton was a weak candidate, with her transactional style and triangulating policy stances, then you probably won't be excited by Biden's multi-decade history in the Senate.\n\nApart from Clinton's inept campaigning and inability to connect with voters, Biden shares many of the same red flags that led a large share of the Democratic base to look with suspicion on the former secretary of state.\n\nIn this series , Jacobin 's Branko Marcetic takes a look back at the career of Delaware's longtime senior senator. Below is Part IV: Joe Biden, Mass Incarceration Zealot.\n\nPart of the reason Hillary Clinton failed in 2016 was due to the reevaluation of her and Bill Clinton's atrocious record on criminal justice , which for decades has devastated the black communities whose votes she and the Democrats desperately want. Well, Joe Biden makes Hillary Clinton look like Michelle Alexander .\n\nBiden's role in passing the 1994 Clinton crime bill - which became a flashpoint in the 2016 Democratic primary - is a well-known part of his legacy . But focusing exclusively on that particular triumph undercuts all the other hard work Biden did over the course of his career to make sure American prisons were well-stocked with young, often black, men.\n\nOne episode in particular sums up Biden's record. In September 1989, George H. W. Bush delivered a speech outlining his National Drug Control Strategy, in which he called for harsher punishments for drug dealers, nearly $1.5 billion toward drug-related law enforcement, and \"more prisons, more jails, more courts, more prosecutors\" at every level throughout the country. At the time, the Heritage Foundation gushed that it constituted \"the largest increase in resources for law enforcement in the nation's history,\" and it's now remembered as a key moment in the escalation of the \"war on drugs.\"\n\nFor Biden, however, it was a half-measure.\n\n\"Quite frankly, the President's plan is not tough enough, bold enough, or imaginative enough to meet the crisis at hand,\" Biden said in a televised response to Bush's speech. \"In a nutshell, the President's plan does not include enough police officers to catch the violent thugs, enough prosecutors to convict them, enough judges to sentence them, or enough prison cells to put them away for a long time.\"\n\nThe episode set the pattern for Biden's career through the 1990s: every time Republicans put forward a measure that escalated the carceral state beyond sense and reason, Biden would look to one-up it.\n\nBiden was already a tough-on-crime evangelist before this speech, of course. In the 1980s, Biden worked with his \" old buddy ,\" arch-segregationist Strom Thurmond , to pass several bills that fundamentally reshaped the American criminal justice system in the direction of more incarceration.\n\nThey, along with Ted Kennedy, had worked on earlier (unsuccessful) proposals that raised maximum penalties, removed a directive requiring the US Sentencing Commission to take into account prison capacity, and created the cabinet-level \"drug czar\" position. In 1984, they passed the Comprehensive Crime Control Act, which, among other things, abolished parole, imposed a less generous cap on \"good time\" sentence reductions, and allowed the Sentencing Commission to issue more punitive guidelines.\n\nBiden would later brag in the Senate that it was under his and Thurmond's leadership that Congress passed a law sending anyone caught with a rock of cocaine the size of a quarter to jail for a minimum of five years. In the same speech Biden went on to take credit for a legislative change allowing the government to effectively rob anyone caught dealing drugs, through the policy of civil asset forfeiture, and demanded to know why the Bush administration hadn't sentenced more drug dealers to life in prison or death once Congress had given him that power.\n\nUnlike Biden's record on civil rights activism, these weren't empty words: he had indeed voted for both the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and its 1988 iteration , which together created a regime of harsh mandatory minimums for drug possession, including the \"quarter\" example Biden would later brag about, as well as the notoriously racist hundred-to-one sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine. The latter also imposed the death penalty for drug-related murders and barred both drug dealers and users from getting government benefits, an amendment Biden specifically voted for .\n\nNot long before Bush's landmark speech on the drug war, Biden released his own drug strategy report, recommending that the government focus on \"the hard-core addict\" because they were \"responsible for most of the drug-related crime and violence.\" \"Every hardcore addict must be faced with one of two stark choices: get into treatment or go to jail and get treatment in jail,\" he wrote.\n\nWhen Bush kicked off the 1990s by putting forward a crime bill based on his National Drug Control Strategy, Biden responded with a bill of his own that was nearly identical . There were some differences: Biden's included a ban on assault rifles, put more money toward treatment, and excised some of Bush's worst excesses, such as extending the death penalty to \"drug kingpins.\" It was also $4 billion bigger, with nearly double the aid to state and local enforcement, triple the added FBI agents, and more DEA agents and prosecutors.\n\nAt first glance, one could give Biden credit for reining in Bush's worst impulses. But it quickly emerged that Biden was happy to jettison any reservations about Bush's measures if it meant having a tough-on-crime law he and the Democrats could take credit for.\n\nBy the time the Senate passed its version of the bill, which featured Bush's dream of expanding the death penalty to a variety of nonviolent crimes, Biden approvingly called it \"the toughest, most comprehensive crime bill in our history.\" When some expressed concern about the fact that more than forty crimes would now be eligible for the death sentence, Biden claimed this was \"vastly overblown in terms of significance.\" No thanks to Biden, this and other items on Bush's wishlist were ultimately stripped from the bill.\n\nA year later, however, with Bush's approval ratings getting a bump from the Gulf War, Biden revived these measures, which also included increasing mandatory minimums, limiting the number of appeals for prisoners, and allowing the use of illegally obtained evidence in court as long as police were acting in \"good faith\" when they broke the law. Biden assured the president that he and the Democrats were \"ready right now\" to pass all of it if Bush just dropped his opposition to the gun control provisions they wanted to pass in tandem.\n\nWhen that bill passed the senate, it expanded the death penalty to fifty-one crimes, restricted death row inmates' ability to appeal their executions, and increased penalties for a variety of offenses, such as dealing drugs at a truck stop. Biden insisted that his bill was \"much tougher than the president's,\" with \"more penalties for death for more offenses,\" and boasted to right-wing critics that \"we do everything but hang people for jaywalking.\"\n\nA couple amendments added by Republican senator Alfonse D'Amato made the bill even worse - making all gun homicides federal crimes eligible for capital punishment (effectively forcing the death penalty on states that lacked it), and requiring a decade in prison for drug trafficking or any violent crime (including threatening force against property) committed while carrying a gun.\n\nBiden, labeled the bill's \"architect\" by the Wall Street Journal , shepherded it to passage, moving several times to end debate on contentious issues and hurry the process along. \"I hope the president would maybe take the politics of crime out of the upcoming elections,\" he after it passed, warning Republicans that they could no longer claim they were tougher on crime. Biden \"had to have more than the president,\" one Democratic aide later explained , which helped propel a \"bidding war\" once the House went on to pass its own version.\n\nIt's not as if there weren't voices speaking out against what Biden and the rest of the Democrats were wreaking. The NAACP and other groups lobbied against the bill . In a letter addressed to senators just a few days before the vote, three ACLU lawyers called the bill \"far worse from a civil liberties perspective than any that has ever been considered by the Senate.\" Lawyers and federal judges - including the latter's official policy-making body - warned it would overwhelm the judicial system and widen its already broad inequality. As the different versions made their way to Bush's desk, the Washington Post condemned them as \"rotten\" and an exercise \"not so much to combat crime as to convince the public that legislators are tough on criminals.\"\n\nWhat finally killed the bill? Just as Republicans accidentally prevented Bill Clinton from cutting Social Security by trying to impeach him, the GOP - outraged that the final version didn't harshly restrict prisoners' ability to appeal their executions, and reluctant to give Democrats a \"win\" going into the 1992 election - blocked it from going further. \"I just can't believe Republicans would kill a death penalty bill,\" said Biden.\n\nThe GOP's spite only postponed Biden's quest to out-tough the GOP on crime, however. In early 1992, Biden continued to accuse Bush of doing too little \"to fight this epidemic,\" insisting that \"unless we embark on a major offensive against drugs, deadly weapons and violent young criminals now, the record carnage will continue to skyrocket.\"\n\nWith Clinton in the White House, Biden got his best chance to launch this \"major offensive.\" He was a key voice pushing Clinton to adopt the tough-on-crime triangulation that would come to tarnish the Clintons' standing with black voters. According to a memo produced by two advisers and unearthed by political scientist Naomi Murakawa, Biden was privately urging Clinton to \"seize control of the issue by upping the ante.\" His crime strategy memos at the time demanded \"rapid enactment of the Biden/Clinton\" crime bill to \"maintain crime as a Democratic initiative.\"\n\nThe result was Clinton's infamous 1994 crime bill, which Clinton signed with Biden proudly at his side. Biden exulted that the bill had achieved nearly every goal he had called for in his fifth report on US drug strategy, including \"more resources to punish drug criminals, cost-effective military-style boot camps for nonviolent drug-addicted offenders, and secure prisons for violent criminals.\" He neatly summed up its provisions on the Senate floor:\n\nThe liberal wing of the Democratic Party is now for 60 new death penalties ... The liberal wing of the Democratic Party has 70 enhanced penalties.... The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 100,000 cops. The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 125,000 new State prison cells.\n\n\"I would like to see the conservative wing of the Democratic Party,\" he quipped. When Bill Kristol told the GOP leadership to keep attacking Democrats on the crime bill, Biden responded: \"I would like to be running and have someone 'use the crime bill' against me.\"\n\nThis was, after all, the essence of Biden's project to create the world's largest prison population : beating the GOP in elections. The countless lives ruined, families broken, and communities devastated by the various \"wars\" on drugs and crime that Biden was crucial to advancing were all pawns in a game of electoral chess to benefit him and his party.\n\n\"I hope to God that Bush attacks us on crime,\" Biden said on the eve of the 2000 election. \"I think we would eat them alive.\" Speaking five years later at the National Sheriffs Association, Biden told the audience that the 1994 bill had been \"written by cops and sheriffs,\" and that \"there is never a time, absent a decrease in population, where you can justify spending less money on crime than you spent the year before.\" He later told the organization, in the midst of his run for president in 2007, that \"my greatest accomplishment is the 1994 Crime Bill.\"\n\nIt's not as if Biden didn't know what he was doing. He had criticized Reagan in 1981 for insisting on harsher sentences, arguing that prisons were already overcrowded and calling for alternative sentencing for non-violent offenders. He just didn't care. Biden had made a calculated decision that the elections he would win were worth the damage he inflicted.\n\nBy the early 2000s, Biden, for a change, turned his attention to a drug mostly consumed by middle-class white kids: ecstasy. Declaring that \"most raves are havens for illicit drug use,\" he introduced an absurd 2002 law that held concert promoters responsible for any drug use at events and treated objects like water bottles and glow sticks as drug paraphernalia. To get the bill passed, Biden re-introduced it numerous times, including once by slipping it into an unrelated bill that created the Amber Alert system. The years that followed saw heavily armed SWAT teams storming raves filled with bewildered, dancing kids - or sometimes DEA agents simpy shutting down events that were neither raves nor involved any drug use.\n\nBiden sings a different tune these days, of course. Most Democrats do, even when their histories are completely at odds with their newfound principles.\n\nBut even if Biden has subsequently learned the error of his ways, the rank cynicism and callousness involved in his two-decade-long championing of carceral policies should be more than enough to give anyone pause about his qualities as a leader, let alone a progressive one.\n\nClinton's \"super-predator\" comment was key to hurting her appeal with the Democratic base when running against Trump. You can be sure Biden's opposition will dredge up his far worse record when the time comes.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

The Democrats who built the overpolicing and mass incarceration regime now feel left out and want to channel that energy back into familiar territory: getting them reelected.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden speaks at the Liberty and Justice Celebration at the Wells Fargo Arena on November 1, 2019 in Des Moines, Iowa.

But that's probably about all we're going to get from them.\n\nA week or so ago, liberals expressed understandable fears of American fascism: armed white vigilantes were joining with police, backed up by the president, to squash constitutionally protected free speech and even kill at least eleven protesters. Luckily, mass protests in a hundred US cities have beaten back police riots and repressive curfews while winning majority public support. Some cities are now reluctantly considering cutting police budgets, and multiple mayors are facing significant pushback, even calls to resign for using curfews and police to crush peaceful protest.\n\nAmericans' political consciousness has shifted thanks to a million angry protesters in the streets. In response, Democrats in Congress introduced a suite of reforms. Inspired by the #8cantwait campaign , Democrats' proposals include a ban on chokeholds (something that wouldn't have stopped the murder of Eric Garner, whose killer used an already banned chokehold), ending no-knock warrants in drug cases, and create a national registry for tracking police misconduct.\n\nThese measures would be useful, but they come nowhere close to addressing one of the primary causes of police violence which activists are calling attention to : the excessive militarization and ever-growing budgets of police and prisons at every level of government, at the expense of education, health care, and other services that would both improve lives and reduce crime.\n\nCongressional Democrats' proposals are cut from the same cloth as a raft of symbolic gestures by corporations , politicians, and police looking to align themselves with righteous but vague calls for justice and against racism. One day before Buffalo police knocked an elderly man unconscious in a sickening viral video, the same police kneeled with protesters for a photo op in the very same place. This tactic reached a comic level Monday when Pelosi, Schumer, and other Democrats kneeled for cameras before introducing their hollow reforms while wearing kente , a traditional Ghanaian textile.\n\nJoe Biden gave an address Tuesday at George Floyd's funeral calling for \"racial justice\" but offering nothing in the way of concrete reforms that would have saved George Floyd or countless others. On Wednesday Biden released a criminal justice platform, including lip service to addressing the root causes of crime but also, amazingly, a pledge to spend $300 million more on policing.\n\nThese gestures are worse than empty. When street protests start to die down (which they will have to eventually), corporate Democrats will try to convince people that the time for disruption is over, and, thanks to them, the problems will be solved. The only thing left for ordinary people to do is vote for Democrats come November .\n\nBut the Democratic Party itself bears enormous responsibility for these crises. After all, many Democratic mayors and governors have called in the police to brutalize and repress peaceful protests across the country. Just as importantly, for the last fifty years, Democrats like Joe Biden have partnered with Republicans in pushing the policies that have built and sustained the mass incarceration system at the root of much of the police violence today. And the injunction to vote our way out of this crisis aims to throw in the towel on mass protest and disruption and instead entrust the same political establishment that brought us to this crisis to pull us out of it.\n\nIn the 1960s Democrats supported some social-democratic reforms to address rising urban poverty and unemployment as part of the \"Great Society.\" But spending on the Vietnam War and the exodus of the middle class to highly segregated suburbs soon dried up funding for Great Society Programs and municipal budgets - just as a conservative, white reaction was growing against the Civil Rights Movement's achievements. By the recessions of the 1970s, Democrats had mostly abandoned their commitments to redistributive reforms, and joined Republicans in a neoliberal assault on unions and social services. Poverty soared, and in cities, crime increased.\n\nWithout a strong labor movement or independent labor party, there was no significant social force pushing for higher taxes on the rich to fund social-democratic reforms. So instead of addressing the economic roots of urban crime , politicians in both parties whipped up racist \"law and order\" sentiment and turned to the cheaper alternative of police and prisons.\n\nBy the 1980s, punishment was also a more electorally popular way of dealing with poor, unemployed people in cities, a large number of whom were black. Democrats were more than happy to be champions of this punitive turn and worked hard to brand themselves as the real \"tough on crime\" party. And champion they did: in the 1990s Bill Clinton pushed through crime and welfare reform legislation that expanded mass incarceration while further gutting programs for the poor. Hillary Clinton was selling this agenda when she made her infamous and racist 1996 \"superpredators\" comment which turned many young progressives against her twenty years later.\n\nWith poverty and inequality worsening and the police state growing, police murders under Barack Obama's tenure sparked the Black Lives Matter protests. While a few activist district attorneys and judges have been elected, Democratic mayors from Houston to Minneapolis still oversee murderous and racist police departments.\n\nDemocrats' anti-mass incarceration posturing will be even more absurd this year since their de facto leader until at least November will be Joe Biden, a mass incarceration zealot who, Branko Marcetic writes , \"makes Hillary Clinton look like Michelle Alexander.\" Biden was a key architect not only of the 1994 Crime Bill, which dramatically expanded police and punishment, but also headed up multiple similar efforts before and since.\n\nFor decades Biden went to great lengths to prove he was tougher on crime than Republicans, making \"law and order\" a central part of his political brand. In 1989, Biden criticized then-President George H.W. Bush's crime legislation for not being \"tough\" or \"bold\" enough: \"In a nutshell, the President's plan does not include enough police officers to catch the violent thugs, enough prosecutors to convict them, enough judges to sentence them, or enough prison cells to put them away for a long time.\"\n\nDuring the key period in which the modern system of American mass incarceration came to be, Biden has repeatedly fought to push this process further . And he's not shy about it, bragging in 2007 that \"my greatest accomplishment is the 1994 Crime Bill.\"\n\nSo it's no great surprise that Democratic mayors, even in liberal cities like Oakland and Seattle, have instituted curfews and sent in police to brutalize and gas peaceful protests in the last two weeks.\n\nThis is why Democrats kneeling in kente cloth while a million people are in the streets protesting Democrats' own legacy of racism and mass incarceration is at best darkly comical. Protesters are proving that the power to win transformative changes in our society has to be anchored in masses of people taking collective action - by marching, sitting in, striking, and generally disrupting business as usual.\n\nAs Nick French writes , today's protests are part of a long tradition of achieving social transformation through mass action. The New Deal of the 1930s and Civil Rights victories of the 1960s were won thanks to \"Millions of ordinary people engaging in (usually illegal) strikes or street protests, often in the face of incredible police brutality, [which] compelled capitalists and state officials to make changes.\" Yet during and after each of these upheavals, disruptive and independent action was subdued and channeled into more acceptable activities like electing Democrats. On some level, of course, this is natural - mass upsurges can't last forever. But the way that that disruptive action has been subdued has often robbed those upsurges and their aftermath of their more transformative potential.\n\nAfter earth-shaking strikes of the 1930s helped build new industrial unions and the CIO, many left-wing labor leaders were convinced that they could best continue labor's advance by throwing their and their unions' support behind FDR's Democratic Party rather than pursue independent political action . Unfortunately, since the late 1930s, Democrats have largely declined to fight for labor, or even defend the New Deal.\n\nWorse still, this Democrat-labor alliance has often worked to actively undermine workers' organizing. For instance, during World War II, FDR incorporated labor leaders into the Democratic Party through administrative appointments. Clothing Workers president Sidney Hillman boasted, \"We have participated in making the labor policy of this administration.\"\n\nBut there was a price to pay for this incorporation: Hillman and other union leaders were recruited to help FDR enforce the wartime \"no-strike pledge\" by breaking the strikes of their own members. This and similar collaboration helped undermine the militant capacities of workers after World War II and set the stage for labor's historic defeats under neoliberalism.\n\nA similar pattern played out in the 1970s and 80s among civil rights activists. Keeanga-Yahmatta Taylor writes in From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation that once the massively disruptive and effective Civil Rights Movement began to recede, \"The Democratic Party had opened itself up to Blacks, women, and youth for fear that these constituencies would pull voters away from mainstream politics.\" In turn, movement activists \"entered the party believing they could use it for their own purposes. But instead of the left turning the party, many activists found themselves having to conform to Democratic Party objectives. In some cases, radicals and revolutionaries ... jumped ship on liberalism altogether and defected to the right wing.\"\n\nThe results have been depressing. While former civil rights activists and other African Americans were elected across the country, this new cohort of politicians largely ended up administering much of the same austerity and repression that mainstream Democrats and Republicans were in this period.\n\nThis is not to say that elections aren't important, especially when socialists use elections and elected office to help stoke working-class discontent. Bernie Sanders's campaign played this role in a whole slew of struggles beyond his campaign . And some left-wing candidates and politicians have been putting their bodies on the line in the last two weeks promoting protests and advancing protesters' demands in concrete legislation.\n\nIn Seattle, socialist city councilmember Kshama Sawant has literally taken to the barricades with protesters to demand a 50 percent reduction in police spending and the resignation of Democratic mayor Jenny Durkan. A slate of socialist candidates for New York state legislative seats have also been at the forefront of the protests , and socialist Janeese Lewis George just won election to Washington, DC council after running on defunding the police . If we are going to win serious reforms, if we are going to truly transform our society into a just and equal one, the working class will need many more elected political leaders and its own political party that's committed to stoking more of this kind of mass action.\n\nReflecting on the 2014-15 BLM movement in 2019, Taylor argued that the mass momentum might have been sustained longer if energy in the streets had been joined with durable, democratic, mass membership organizations. Formal organization would have allowed more debate over strategy and tactics, democratic accountability of de facto leaders, funding sources independent of conservatizing funders like the Ford Foundation , and encouraged sustained and active participation among broader layers of activists.\n\nBut in the absence of such organization, mass marches and mass actions were deemphasized. Activists instead went in two directions: some carried out \"actions [that were] smaller, more secretive, led by small groups of people who were then vulnerable to arrest\"; and others were absorbed into the moderating influence of NGOs, foundation funding, and Democratic Party roundtables and electoral efforts.\n\nTaylor affirms the need for continued mass action which can not only scare the political and economic establishment into making changes, but also breaks thousands of participants \"from the isolation of everyday life and turns us into political actors.\" Mass action shows \"how the solution to so many of our problems is collective.\"\n\nIf and when the tidal wave of street protests begins to recede, thousands of people activated by this movement will need to continue organizing for the long haul - and they must do so independently of the Democratic politicians and their racist, anti-worker agenda that got us here. That might mean supporting local Black Lives Matter protests, joining a socialist organization , starting a committee at your school or workplace to fight against racism and for defunding the police , organizing a union to protect workers from racism and exploitation, or even going on strike . What it doesn't mean, however, is entrusting the same Democrats who helped create mass incarceration to now dismantle it.\n\nJeremy Gong is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America in California's East Bay.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Penn State / Flickr\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nBill Clinton never treated his brutal criminal justice measures as some sort of morally queasy compromise with Republicans; he advocated for them himself and was unequivocal in his defense of them, treating them as a positive good rather than a necessary evil.\n\nAs a British newspaper observed at the time about the signing of the crime bill: \"Mr. Clinton is couching his defense of the bill in punitive terms, praising its extensions of the death penalty, and its funds to increase prisons and police numbers by 20 percent, and mandatory life sentences for a third felony conviction.\"\n\nHis support was not qualified by any serious doubts; he emphatically stated that the crime bill reflected the country's \"values.\" At his signing ceremony, Clinton announced that in passing the bill, \"[w]e together are taking a big step toward bringing the laws of our land in line with the values of our people.\"\n\nBut as criminal justice journalist Natasha Vargas-Cooper observes, \"Those values would come to define the current morass of mass incarceration: punitive, arbitrary, and fear-based.\" Clinton's crime bill \"is now widely seen as contributing to the human catastrophe of mass incarceration,\" with Clinton overseeing the largest increase in prison inmates of any American president, including Ronald Reagan. Throughout the 1990s, the prison population continued to rapidly expand, until millions were housed in US jails and prisons.\n\nThe statistics are by now depressingly familiar. The prison boom had especially harsh consequences for African Americans. Soon, one in every fifteen black men would be in jail or prison, with one-third being incarcerated in their lifetimes. Prison sentences of black men were nearly 20 percent longer than those of white men for similar crimes. More black men are under correctional control than were enslaved in 1850, and a black child whose father didn't complete high school has a 50 percent chance of seeing him incarcerated by the time she reaches the age of fourteen.\n\nMass incarceration ripped black communities apart, taking parents away from children and husbands away from wives. Sociologists Bruce Western and Becky Pettit write about the prison \"poverty trap,\" whereby those released from prison are stuck in a neverending cycle of joblessness and despair, with prison compounding preexisting disadvantages and steadily eroding social institutions. Those released from prison have a hard time finding jobs, and \"workers with prison records experience significant declines in earnings and employment.\"\n\nWestern and Pettit also document the effects of prisons on families. Not only does it take parents away from children by locking up fathers, but \"parents in prison are likely to divorce or separate, and through the contagious effects of the institution, their children are in some degree 'prisonized,' exposed to the routines of prison life through visitation and the parole supervision of their parents.\"\n\nThe Violent Crime Control Act was the apotheosis of late-twentieth-century American draconianism. When the bill was finally signed into law, Jesse Jackson called it a \"criminal act,\" invoking Jim Crow and lambasting Clinton.\n\nIf Reagan had proposed a Howard Johnson \"sixty new flavors of killing\" plan, if Reagan had proposed ten billion dollars in new prison construction, while school systems in DC close because of lack of capital improvement, and others should be closed for the same reason, there'd have been massive demonstrations. Reagan could not have put through this crime bill. Bush could not have put through this crime bill. It's a combination of Kool-Aid and cyanide.\n\nBut the 1994 crime bill was only the beginning of Clinton's implementation of \"get tough\" policy-making. Those attempting to excuse Clinton for the crime bill have argued that it was a reasonable response to the excessive crime rates of the period. But even as people were noting declines in criminal violence later on, during the mid 1990s, Clinton was still attempting to seem tougher on crime than Republicans.\n\nIn 1996, under the headline \"While Crime Has Declined, The Campaign Rhetoric Hasn't,\" the Philadelphia Inquirer took note of the strange contradiction between the reality of the crime statistics and the overheated political rhetoric about crime coming from both Clinton and Dole.\n\nWhile Americans became steadily safer, Bill Clinton continued to propose extreme new initiatives on crime control.\n\nClinton advocated strict curfews for juveniles, a policy almost certain to lead to the racially disproportionate hassling of African-American young people, and difficulties for teens who worked late at jobs. He promoted and signed legislation cutting school funding from states that did not adopt \"zero tolerance\" expulsion policies for a child that brought a gun to school. (Hillary Clinton brags proudly of this policy, and several of the other crime control initiatives, in her memoir.) Clinton also supported amending the Constitution to add a \"crime victims' rights\" provision.\n\nClinton also took a number of executive steps to advance and expand the reach of the drug war. Clinton \"greatly expand[ed] the scope of routine drug testing\" in the federal prison system, by requiring that every person arrested be given a drug test, instead of the previous policy of testing at random. Not only that, but Clinton pressured state governments to adopt the same policy, vowing \"to take all appropriate steps to encourage the states to adopt and implement the same policies that we are initiating at the federal level.\"\n\nClinton was also strongly insistent on strict drug testing for all parolees, saying: \"It's time to say to parolees, if you go back on drugs, you'll go back to jail.\"\n\nClinton even tried to insinuate his drug testing programs into unprecedented realms. He proposed, for example, that every teenager should be required to take a drug test before being issued a driver's license. Speaking in favor of his initiative, Clinton said:\n\nI believe we should use the privilege of a driver's license to demand responsible behavior by young people when it comes to drugs, too . . . We're already saying to teens if you drink you aren't allowed to drive. Now we should say that teens should pass a drug test as a condition of getting a driver's license. Our message should be simple: No drugs or no driver's license.\n\nWhen Clinton released this plan, the legal director of the ACLU called it a \"drug mania gone crazy.\" The ACLU pointed out that the idea was downright foolish from a social policy perspective, since \"depriving somebody of the ability to drive may mean depriving them of the ability to go to school, get a job, support their families or do the kinds of things that prevent them from doing drugs.\"\n\nPerhaps one of Clinton's most shameful drug war ignominies was the issue of the crack-cocaine sentencing disparity. Here, Clinton not only knowingly and materially furthered the enactment of a racist policy, but he misled black leaders about his role in doing so.\n\nCivil rights groups had long objected to a major injustice in cocaine sentencing policy. While those convicted of possessing powdered cocaine faced a one-year prison sentence, crack possessors received a mandatory five years. And for dealers, trafficking in five grams of crack was treated with the same severity as tracking in five hundred grams of powder cocaine, a hundred-to-one disparity. As everyone knew, crack-cocaine users were far more likely to be black than powder cocaine users; the vast majority of those prosecuted federally on crack charges were black or Latino.\n\nThe end result was that black cocaine addicts and dealers were given far higher prison sentences than their white counterparts, even when having handled precisely the same amount of cocaine.\n\nAs Representative Melvin Watt explained, \"[i]f somebody is convicted of selling $225 worth of crack cocaine, they get the same penalty as somebody who sells $50,000 worth of powder cocaine . . . Poor young kids who can afford only crack go to jail. Rich young kids who can afford powder go home and sleep in their own beds.\"\n\nActivists and black leaders had long fought to have crack and powder cocaine sentencing equalized. And in 1995, it seemed as if they might finally have succeeded. The United States Sentencing Commission , after studying the disparity, produced a recommendation that it be equalized.\n\nAfter investigating the issue, the commission concluded that \"the media and public fears of a direct relationship between crack and other crimes do not seem confirmed by empirical data.\" But when the commission moved to implement the recommendation, Congress passed a bill blocking the plan.\n\nBlack lawmakers called on Clinton to retain the sentencing commission's recommendation by exercising his veto power. Civil rights groups \"led a telephone campaign to pressure the president to veto the bill.\" Jesse Jackson said the president had the ability \"with one stroke of your veto pen, to correct the most grievous racial injustice built into our legal system.\" The Congressional Black Caucus said that the discrepancies \"make a mockery of justice\" and that it is \"the first test of our seriousness . . . to aggressively root out and eliminate policies and practices that are patently unfair.\"\n\nAnd the political cover was clear: Clinton could simply claim that he deferred to the superior expertise of the sentencing commission, without needing to make a particularly spirited argument in favor of racial justice.\n\nClinton signed the bill into law, nullifying the sentencing commission's recommendation and retaining the one-hundred-to-one disparity. He defended his decision with a grand display of anti-drug tough talk.\n\n\"I am not going to let anyone who peddles drugs get the idea that the cost of doing business is going down,\" Clinton said. \"Tough penalties for crack trafficking are required because of the effect on individuals and families, related gang activity, turf battles and other violence.\"\n\nCivil rights groups were livid. Clinton's decision to sign the legislation came just over one week after he had spoken publicly about racial inequities in the criminal courts. On the day of Louis Farrakhan's Million Man March , Clinton had given a speech about race relations in which he declared that \"Blacks are right to think something is terribly wrong . . . when almost one in three African American men in their twenties are either in jail, on parole, or otherwise under the supervision of the criminal justice system.\"\n\nClinton said that it was unfair that a \"disproportionate percentage\" of black men were in prison for drug crimes \"in comparison to the percentage of blacks who use drugs in our society.\" Clinton's comments were made on October 16. On October 27, the press reported that he would be rejecting the recommendation to equalize crack and powder sentences.\n\nThe reversal was seen as an attempt to avoid upsetting white voters. As a sentencing commission official commented upon Clinton's signing of the bill, \"[t]his is a total political call on their part . . . They are not going to do anything that will make the president look bad on the crime issue.\"\n\nThe Washington Post 's editorial board criticized Clinton for making \"the easy, politically safe choice,\" noting that the president \"played down the real issue - terrible sentence disparity - and signed with a flourish and the usual anti-crime rhetoric.\" By this point, though, the Post sighed, it was probably \"unrealistic to expect the president to do the right thing\" on such an issue.\n\nBut Clinton's stance was actually worse than it seemed; not only did he not want to lower cocaine punishments, he wanted to increase them. Yet he made every effort to conceal his true position.\n\nSpeaking to a group of black journalists, Clinton indicated that the crack/powder inequity pained him, saying that \"the situation that exists is unfair, unjustifiable, and should be changed. And I'm going to do what I can to eliminate a huge percentage of the disparity.\"\n\nOne might think this flatly contradicted his actions. After all, a man who had wanted to \"eliminate a huge percentage of the disparity\" had signed legislation rejecting the sentencing commission's proposal to eliminate the disparity.\n\nBut there was no contradiction at all. What Clinton actually meant by \"eliminate the disparity\" was raising powder cocaine sentences in order to match crack sentences, rather than reducing crack sentences.\n\nHe did not have in mind a proposal like that of the sentencing commission, which would have lowered the amount of time drug offenders spent in prison. As he said upon signing the legislation affirming the disparity, \"when large-scale cocaine traffickers sell powder with the knowledge that it will be converted into crack, they should be punished as severely as those who distribute the crack itself.\" Elsewhere, Clinton was even more explicit that his concern for \"reducing the disparity\" meant \"injustice for all\":\n\nQuestion: Well, would you raise the penalty for powder cocaine?\n\nBill Clinton: That's what I would do - yes . . . there's no question that the disparity is entirely too great in the sentencing. And I think when it comes to trafficking, they should raise the cocaine trafficking penalties.\n\nOf course, this was like proposing to fix racial disparities in death penalty sentencing by simply finding more white people to kill. Perversely, Clinton's position made him appear to care about the inequity, while in reality not proposing to alleviate any of the punishment inflicted on people being convicted under the unjust crack laws. Fixing the disparity without lowering crack sentences presumed that those sentences were perfectly fair, but that powder cocaine users were simply getting off lightly. Its solution was to make members of all races suffer equally.\n\nOne of the key points made by opponents of the disparity had been that all cocaine starts as powder cocaine; crack is derived from powder. The result was that street-level crack dealers were punished more heavily than their suppliers. As the Washington Post 's Jefferson Morley explained:\n\nImagine two drug dealers, one a supplier and one a street dealer. The supplier sells the street dealer three grams of cocaine. The street dealer mixes the drug with baking soda, cooks it in his microwave oven, producing six grams of crystalline smokeable crack cocaine. If he gets arrested and sent to federal court, he faces a mandatory minimum of five years in jail. The supplier has to get caught with 500 grams of powder cocaine - about 1.7 pounds - to face that much time in federal prison.\n\nClinton's response to this was to concede that it was unfair - then to insist that the supplier be punished just as heavily. At every point, Clinton openly attempted to fudge and equivocate on the issue, so that black audiences would think he wanted to fix the disparity, while he simultaneously told white audiences that he would have no mercy when it came to the scourge of crack in American cities, and did not believe in being soft on drug dealers.\n\nIn 1997, the sentencing commission tried again, issuing a recommendation that the disparity be reduced to a mere ten to one. This time, Clinton signed on and promised to support the plan in his dealings with Congress. But the Congressional Black Caucus sensed Clinton's commitment was anemic, and insisted that having ten-to-one racist sentencing was only somewhat better than having one hundred-to-one racist sentencing.\n\nUltimately the Black Caucus's view didn't matter; the proposal went nowhere and the law remained unchanged. As the CBC predicted, Clinton did not follow through on his promise to pressure Congress.\n\nStill, Clinton now uses his tepid support for the ten-to-one plan to portray himself as a crusader for reform. Asked by Democracy Now! in 2000 to defend his record on drug crime, Clinton used it to boast that \"I did my best to persuade Congress to get rid of the discrepancy between crack and powdered cocaine in the sentencing guidelines.\" To another journalist, Clinton blamed the Right, saying that \"by the time we got to this issue, the Republicans were in [the] majority and we just couldn't do it.\" He did not mention that when he was afforded the unrestricted opportunity to eliminate that discrepancy entirely, he had chosen not to.\n\nNathan J.

Under the guise of protecting children, the media-driven hysteria helped spur mass incarceration.\n\nThe California Institution for Men prison fence is seen on August 19, 2009 in Chino, California.\nMichal Czerwonka / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe missing-child panic began with Etan Patz. Plenty of kids had gone missing before, but Etan's case seemed specially designed to provoke a mass hysteria. In 1979, the six-year-old boy's mother arranged for him to walk to the school bus stop on his own. She watched him depart from her Manhattan fire escape. Another mother was waiting two blocks away in an apartment overlooking the bus stop site, but Etan never arrived.\n\nThe tragedy was and remains impossible to comprehend. His first time walking to the bus stop? Two blocks away? With adults looking out for him? It meant something. There were powerful forces capable of unfathomable violence - forces previously undetected, possibly swiftly advancing, perhaps already everywhere - from which nobody was safe.\n\nHigh-quality photographs of Etan taken by his father, a professional photographer, blanketed the city and the national news media for months, which stretched into years. Fear began to mount, and eventually all were afraid. Children's faces, including but hardly limited to Etan's, began appearing on milk cartons. In 1982, CBS Evening News informed rapt and terrified adults that up to fifty thousand American children were being kidnapped by strangers every year.\n\n\"These figures were wildly inflated, as journalists, social scientists, and government officials had made clear by the mid-1980s,\" writes Paul Renfro in his new book Stranger Danger: Family Values, Childhood, and the American Carceral State. But it didn't matter. Panic had clenched the nation's psyche, and its grip was tightening.\n\nRenfro situates the response to Etan Patz's disappearance in the context of 1970s New York. As \"deindustrialization battered New York City with an enduring intensity\" and \"some two million white New Yorkers bolted for the suburbs,\" the city was left in crisis. The social chaos that resulted - which was exaggerated, as Renfro points out, but did include rising crime - demanded a response of some kind. That response could have been an expanded welfare state. Instead, it was austerity and a bulked-up policing and carceral apparatus .\n\nIt's no coincidence that the nation's missing child or \"stranger danger\" panic originated in a city that much of the nation had already come to regard as the epicenter of dangerous strangers - and a city that had already begun to lay the groundwork to respond with more police and prisons. The link between mass incarceration and violence against children was there from the beginning of the stranger danger panic, foreshadowing what would transpire in the decades to come.\n\nRenfro's book covers a great deal of territory, including, interestingly, how homophobia dovetailed with the stranger danger panic. It was assumed for decades that Patz's abductors were associated with NAMBLA, the North American Man/Boy Love Association, a fringe group that became a source of lurid fascination, especially among conservatives who declared its existence a natural consequence of extending rights to LGBT people.\n\nIn 2017, a man named Pedro Hernandez was convicted of Etan's murder. He had a history of mental illness that caused hallucinations. He had no NAMBLA affiliation, and claimed in his confession that his motive was not sexual. But decades had already passed during which Etan Patz's disappearance, the advance of gay rights, and the threat of pedophilia had all swirled into one big, indistinguishable phenomenon for millions of onlookers.\n\nRenfro's most important contention in Stranger Danger, however, is that the missing children panic of the 1980s and '90s played an important political role in the rise in mass incarceration. The names and images of individual missing and murdered children - always white, middle-class ones - were used throughout the era to justify tough-on-crime legislation submitted by both Republicans and Democrats and shield that legislation from criticism.\n\nThe Reagan administration, which had made family values and law and order two of its central themes, found that the stranger danger panic combined them perfectly.\n\nIn response to Etan's disappearance, Reagan assembled a task force on missing and exploited children. The task force proceeded to issue recommendations primarily hinging on restoring nuclear families so that children would be safe in their homes, with both of their parents, away from strangers. Never mind that the Reaganite agenda of privatization and austerity was in fact placing dreams of normative nuclear family life farther out of reach for many working-class people, to say nothing of rising incarceration. And never mind that most physical and sexual abuse of children is perpetrated by their own family members or well-known adults anyway.\n\nThe Reagan administration was ostentatious in its advocacy for legislation that would increase criminal penalties on those who harm children. Given the widespread hysteria at the time that child abduction by strangers was a mass phenomenon, these measures gave an indisputably heroic sheen to the Republican Party's other tough-on-crime, harsher-penalty advocacy - the bare bones of mass incarceration.\n\nReagan devoted many of his speeches to reinforcing the idea that social chaos was threatening everything we hold dear and promising to hold back the forces of darkness with law and order. What most people saw was that Reagan made May 25 National Missing Children's Day in honor of Etan Patz - but what also happened was that the prison population exploded during his presidency. The same process occurred throughout the period on the state level.\n\nThis moment in history coincided with the Democrats' sharp rightward turn; during the Reagan administration, then-senator Joe Biden co-wrote drug crime legislation with the segregationist Strom Thurmond. And so rather than reject Reagan's disingenuous use of missing and dead children to rationalize harsher penalties and expand the carceral system, leading Democrats studied and imitated it to great effect.\n\nIn 1993, twelve-year-old Polly Klaas was kidnapped and murdered by a stranger in California. \"While Americans are more secure from threats abroad, we all know that in many ways we are less secure from threats here at home,\" said Bill Clinton in his 1994 State of the Union address. \"Every day the national peace is shattered by crime. In Petaluma, California, an innocent slumber party gives way to agonizing tragedy for the family of Polly Klaas.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Those who commit repeated violent crimes should be told, 'When you commit a third violent crime, you will be put away, and put away for good.'\" He was using Polly Klaas's name to advocate for the 1994 Crime Bill, which expanded mass incarceration like no other single piece of federal legislation in American history.\n\n\"From December 1993 through the 1996 reelection campaign, Clinton mentioned the Klaas case in at least sixteen separate public speeches,\" Renfro observes. Polly's father joined Clinton as he campaigned for the crime bill.\n\nA February 1994 memo written by a Clinton policy advisor states that \"Klaas's support for the administration's anti-crime efforts is invaluable to us, not just in the coming weeks as we push to pass the crime bill, but over the long haul as we seek to prove that Democrats are not soft on crime.\" The 1994 crime bill was dedicated in Polly Klaas's name.\n\nThe period saw a proliferation of such \"memorial laws,\" legislative interventions with enormous implications muscled through with a dead child's name on them.\n\nIncluded in the crime bill was the Wetterling Act, named after eleven-year-old Jacob Wetterling who was kidnapped and murdered in Minnesota in 1989. Just months before the passage of the crime bill, seven-year-old Megan Kanka was murdered by a neighbor in New Jersey. In 1996, an amendment was added to the 1994 Wetterling Act called Megan's Law. The Wetterling Act helped create a national sex offender registry, and the Megan's Law stipulated that the information it contained should be proactively shared with the public.\n\nThe ACLU and others raised concerns that some memorial laws were too far-reaching, and had implications that were not being thoroughly discussed - including potentially increasing the likelihood that an offender, now experiencing a form of \"social death\" with no hope of reintegration into normal society , would see little reason to restrain themselves from reoffending. A few advocates also pointed out that the emphasis was all wrong: most children are harmed by people they know, not by strangers. But the names and images of murdered children were a shield against all criticism. Those who flagged issues with the laws found few friends.\n\nThe memorial laws passed, and so too did the crime bill, buoyed by the inclusion of legislation that claimed to protect children as well as the attached Violence Against Women Act. If you didn't support the crime bill, the implication became that you did support violence against women and children. \"The image of endangered childhood proved vital in this environment of intense anticrime sentiment,\" writes Renfro. In other words, tragedies like the murders of Jacob Wetterling, Polly Klaas, and Megan Kanka helped sell tough-on-crime legislation that would have consequences that extended far beyond the protection of children from dangerous strangers.\n\nLike Marc Klaas, Wetterling's mother was at first a crusader for the legislation named after her son. But after two decades of activism against child sexual exploitation, she changed her outlook, concluding that the sex offender registry system did not make children or adults safer from sexual predation. Most studies now indicate that that they simply don't work: overall registries don't decrease sex crime recidivism. \"What we really want is no more victims,\" Patty Wetterling now says . \"Don't do it again. So, how can we get there? Locking them up forever, labeling them, and not allowing them community support doesn't work. I've turned 180 [degrees] from where I was.\"\n\nThe logic extends to the rest of the tough-on-crime legislation of the era. It should be obvious to us now that harsher penalties do not act as crime deterrents. Instead the resultant mass incarceration destabilizes individual lives and whole communities, doing nothing to reduce crime - in fact driving it upward.\n\nThe road forked before Etan Patz disappeared, when rising urban crime could have received one of two responses: a supportive one, characterized by genuine public investment in the well-being of all people, or a punitive one, characterized by harsher laws and more police and prisons. The nation chose the latter, and the images of children tragically kidnapped, abused, and murdered by strangers helped sell us on that choice.\n\nIt's impossible to undo the mistakes of the last half-century. But like Patty Wetterling, we can turn 180 degrees and choose a response that actually has a chance of fostering the safety and well-being of both children and adults, starting today.\n\nMeagan Day is a staff writer at Jacobin .

One explanation is that the party has failed to enhance working-class power as it did during the New Deal order. Since the 1990s especially, egalitarian redistribution and large-scale developmentalism have given way to the policy preferences of the donor class. For some, the problem is that the Democrats have lost their way after decades of playing defense against an increasingly radical Republican right. Despite promises of a new economic paradigm, an array of setbacks underscore that the Joe Biden administration lacks the resolve to meet this moment.\n\nWhile accurate, this narrative nevertheless underplays the extent to which the neoliberal turn of the party of Franklin D. Roosevelt emerged organically out of the Democrats' postwar professional-political networks. Rather than an accommodation to the Right, the Democrats' neoliberal turn was an attempt to create a new social contract legitimized on meritocratic and pro-market principles, argues the historian Lily Geismer in Left Behind: The Democrats' Failed Attempt to Solve Inequality.\n\nGeismer, a professor of twentieth-century US history at Claremont McKenna College, is also the author of Don't Blame Us: Suburban Liberals and the Transformation of the Democratic Party. In her first monograph, she sought to explain the ideological shift within the Democratic Party, using a case study of Massachusetts to show how urban minorities and industrial labor unions were gradually marginalized in favor of suburban professionals. Her latest effort advances the uncomfortable thesis that Democratic neoliberalism \"was based on a genuine belief in the power of the market and private sector to achieve traditional liberal ideas of creating equality, individual choice, and help for people in need.\"\n\nGeismer introduces Left Behind by tracing the Third Way's roots to the 1970s, describing how specific, liberal ideas about growth were detached from the redistributive politics that undergirded the New Deal coalition. Beginning with the \"Watergate Babies,\" a new generation of Democratic leaders who extolled meritocracy, competition, and innovation was determined to reclaim and recast the political center. While dominated by Southerners such as Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Gillis Long, and Charles Robb, Geismer emphasizes that this emerging cohort spanned every region of the country, and included ostensibly more liberal voices from the Northeast such as Michael Dukakis and Paul Tsongas .\n\nClinton's 1992 campaign, marked early on by his vow to \"end welfare as we know it,\" was not an abrupt deviation in Democratic politics, Geismer argues. Rather, it was the culmination of a strategy to center the \"entrepreneurial, postindustrial economy\" and \"use the resources and techniques of the market to make government more efficient.\"\n\nBeyond an unwavering emphasis on growth over social justice, New Democrats sidelined the core constituencies - labor unions, black voters, and, increasingly, feminists and environmentalists - that the national party had cultivated since the mid-1930s. As they gelled around the prescriptions of the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC; a neoliberal think tank founded in 1985 with the goal of winning back suburban white voters who had defected to the GOP), New Democrats echoed right-wing attacks on welfare. They also \"recoiled at the transactional politics\" of Tip O'Neill, the Democratic congressional leader who personified the vestiges of New Deal liberalism. Resigned to the fate of traditional industries and unions, if not hostile to them, New Democrats perceived globalization as not only inevitable but desirable. The key to prosperity was more STEM education, less social spending, and fewer barriers to entrepreneurship.\n\nThe fixation on entrepreneurship, Geismer reveals, had globe-spanning origins. Through a fascinating discussion of the pioneers of microfinance and microenterprise, from ShoreBank in Chicago to Muhammad Yunus's Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, Geismer shows how \"socially responsible investing\" first caught Clinton's attention as governor of Arkansas. In the early postwar era, Arkansas had pursued a development strategy of \"smokestack chasing,\" but by the time Clinton entered office, the heyday of company towns was over.\n\nClinton's embrace of public-private agencies as a mechanism for spurring growth was bolstered through his connections with these pioneers of for-profit development banking and the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation, named after Arkansas's first Republican governor since Reconstruction. Yunus's maxim that credit \"was the most basic right since it led to all other rights\" spoke directly to New Democrats' equation of empowerment with personal responsibility. It was a utopian conviction that influenced Clinton's justification of workfare and programs to incentivize poor people to become thrifty entrepreneurs.\n\nThe significance of this backstory, Geismer shows, is that it illustrates the matrix of philanthropies, for-profit development banking, and corporate-friendly public officials that would shape Third Way governance in the 1990s. To distinguish their philosophy from Reagan's \"trickle-down\" theory of growth, New Democrats repeatedly emphasized how government should catalyze \"opportunity\" and apply, as one strategist wrote, its \"immense leverage to structure the market so that millions of businesses and individuals have incentives\" to combine growth with inclusion.\n\nFrom the New Democrats' perspective, market inclusion and market expansion were mutually constitutive: ensuring both was a logical extension of mid-century liberals' aim to remove discrimination in business and lending practices. As Clinton later put it when promoting the National Homeownership Strategy, his administration's purpose was to \"target new markets [and] underserved populations\" and \"tear down the barriers of discrimination wherever they were found.\" Demonstrating that the Democratic Party could tackle \"dependency\" and economic marginalization in a manner that was consistent with free markets, meanwhile, would assuage the fears of white moderates that the party had accommodated too many demands of minorities and other liberal groups.\n\nThe developmental programs that captured Clinton's imagination thus had a disciplinary logic: overreliance on for-profit entities would inevitably create new winners and losers amid a shrinking safety net. Yet New Democrats were willing to countenance this new social contract. Promises to expand ownership and unleash urban purchasing power were at odds with the fact that, by design, Third Way governance could only reinforce the trend of uneven development and disinvestment that had troubled the country since the late 1970s.\n\nAcross Geismer's documentation of the Clinton administration's market-based development programs and reforms, she clarifies how delegating public administration to the private sector, as well as groups that were formally nonprofit but generously funded by elites, was a form of privatization in the United States, particularly in the areas of local development, education, and regulations on corporate labor practices.\n\nA few, lesser-known examples illuminate the extent to which applying business logic to government - and actively encouraging governance via the private and nonprofit sectors - consolidated the Democratic Party's departure from New Deal liberalism. At the urging of Robert Rubin, the director of the National Economic Council who subsequently served as Clinton's treasury secretary, the White House rejected at the outset of Clinton's first term both a large-scale stimulus program to reverse years of urban neglect and an overt industrial policy to foster new manufacturing jobs. Instead, it set up a competition to award block grants to deserving \"empowerment zones\" - a concept borrowed from Republican Jack Kemp.\n\nAlongside development programs that drew from Clinton's experience as governor, empowerment zones were part of the administration's twin goals to attract private investment to struggling municipalities and introduce competition to the public sector. As with welfare reform and urban renewal programs that pathologized public housing, the administration's rationale was to instill poor communities with the values of personal responsibility. Simultaneously, it was eager to demonstrate public-private partnerships could stimulate grassroots initiatives and facilitate, as Geismer writes, \"unlikely coalitions\" between community groups, influential business interests, and local government.\n\nThe administration unreservedly applied these same ideas to education policy. Despite the protests of teachers' unions that charter schools would worsen inequality, the White House embraced the arguments of Silicon Valley's tech entrepreneurs and venture capitalists that charter schools should compete with underperforming (and chronically underfunded) public schools. Within a formally nonprofit arena, a crop of new foundations - NewSchools Venture Funds, for example, along with \"behemoths\" established by Eli Broad, Bill and Melinda Gates, and the Walton Family - partly privatized one of the most elemental public goods in US society.\n\nGeismer writes that what amounted to a stealthy outsourcing of investment in education was draped in the language of improving accountability, even as the philanthropies themselves were not accountable to other civil society groups or the state. As Geismer suggests, the charter school movement enmeshed the party with its new donor class, amplifying a pattern in which wealthy elites secured tax write-offs through philanthropic endeavors.\n\nPerhaps the most stunning break with New Deal liberalism concerned the administration's approach to labor relations and corporate power. In addition to endorsing trade policies that accelerated the loss of manufacturing jobs, the administration sanctioned the spread of voluntary \"self-regulation\" in industry, a notion that flew in the face of decades of painstakingly won labor and antitrust law. Revelations of terrible abuses in the global supply chains of famous American brands as well as the resurgence of domestic sweatshops prompted the Clinton administration to advise firms to \"self-monitor their sub-contractors\" and launch the voluntarist Apparel Industry Partnership and Fair Labor Association.\n\nThese commissions, however, epitomized business-friendly corporatism and the New Democrats' aversion to beefing up labor regulations. Grossly underfunded since the Jimmy Carter era, an overwhelmed Labor Department sought expedient action that emphasized \"corporate responsibility\"; other members of the administration, such as Robert Rubin and commerce secretary Ron Brown, strongly advised against language and measures that could in any way rattle major firms and global markets. The reliance on trade associations to police industry practices in place of vigorous government oversight weakened the labor movement and continued to expose vulnerable immigrant workers to exploitation and hazardous conditions.\n\nThe blessing the administration granted to self-regulation reinforced the dividing line of accountability in American society that a trio of laws - the 1994 crime bill, welfare reform, and the 1996 immigration act - would crystallize. While some corporations found it worthwhile to promote their brands on the basis of ethical consumerism, others such as Nike tried to whitewash the occasional damning news report with philanthropic grants and defensive arguments that echoed those defenses of globalization put forward by economists like Paul Krugman and Jeffrey Sachs. Without stronger domestic and international labor laws and environmental protections, it was up to businesses to determine what counted as ethical and how transparent they wanted to be about it.\n\nThroughout Left Behind there are many other unnerving implications for the New Democrats' role in perpetuating inequality, from the rise of mass incarceration to the ways asset inflation, deregulated finance, and Big Tech gave birth to a gig economy of piece-rate wages. At its worst, the Clinton administration approached impoverished communities with a civilizing mission redolent of older theories of capitalist improvement.\n\nAs Geismer notes in a striking passage on Clinton's \"New Markets Tour,\" his team brought a coterie of executives to what they called \"pockets of poverty\" - the \"left behind\" places that, with the right private incentives, could at last be integrated into the modern economy. On one of the stops along this tour, an executive who was seated next to Jesse Jackson remarked as both men watched Clinton give a speech at the Pine Ridge Reservation that \"I've always just seen Indian reservations. . . . Now, I see two supermarkets. I see a car dealership. I see 7,000 people wearing clothes. I see a market.\"\n\nYet party leaders seemed utterly confident they were extending substantial opportunities to those who had been excluded from prosperity and development. The euphoria of the late '90s boom virtually extinguished any concerns the Democratic establishment may have harbored over the social risks of a deindustrializing and financialized economy. But the trade shocks would come, and the places left behind - whether in Appalachia, East Saint Louis, or Michigan - would multiply, especially in the wake of the subprime mortgage crisis and the Great Recession.\n\nBy the new millennium, corporate influence over the Democrats dwarfed that of organized labor. With each endeavor to reinvent government, Clinton burnished the party's image with affluent liberals and moderates - an approach that held hostage the multiracial, working-class constituencies the party had forged between the New Deal and Great Society. As the Republican Party shifted in toto to the hard right, labor unions, minorities, and progressives were forced to work with a party that had not merely curtailed its ambitions for reform but accelerated the rise of global governance by multinational corporations, transnational financial institutions, and billionaire philanthropists.\n\nThe patterns of deindustrialization and declining union power from the late 1970s onward, meanwhile, had led party activists to become too consumed with winning back the presidency. In many respects, New Democrats and their Barack Obama-era successors were able to take grassroots support, from fundraising to voter outreach, for granted.\n\nFor the broad liberal-left, these conditions led to co-optation, mostly fractured resistance, and a certain myopia about the political stakes of the 1990s. On this point, the trajectory of civil rights activist and two-time presidential candidate Jesse Jackson is instructive. As Geismer attests, Jackson was the strongest Democratic voice for a multiracial left populism in the period between 1980 and 2000 and a fierce critic of the DLC's priorities. Even so, she writes, Clinton and Wall Street magnates eventually won Jackson over to Third Way ideas and inspired him to promote a new iteration of black capitalism through his \"Wall Street Project,\" which energetically pursued investment in black entrepreneurship and greater representation of black professionals at major firms.\n\nJackson's acquiescence offers a window to consider how Democratic elites throughout history have alternately accommodated or neutralized the demands of social movements. As ever, the United States' two-party system makes it difficult to envision challenges to neoliberalism that do not rely, in some form, on the Democrats. The task, as political scientist Daniel Scholzman has argued , is that the Left must figure out, once more, how to anchor the party in a vision to \"transform American life\" and \"see over the horizon.\"\n\nJustin H.

But troubling incidents - including fatal shootings by police officers in the state - during her time as California's \"top cop\" suggest that wasn't always the case.\n\nWhen Kamala Harris was California's attorney general, she did not investigate the fatal shootings of two unarmed men by the same Anaheim police officer less than a year apart.

The new bill was named for George Floyd, who was killed in May 2020 by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who had previously used fatal force and had a history of misconduct complaints. Among other things, the legislation would create a grant program for state attorneys general to assist them in conducting independent investigations in police misconduct cases.\n\nIn the lead-up to the vote, Vice President Kamala Harris, who spearheaded similar legislation in the Senate with Cory Booker in June, lauded the bill on Twitter.\n\n\"The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act represents an important step towards ensuring more accountability and transparency in policing,\" she tweeted. \"I join [President Joe Biden] in encouraging Congress to pass this legislation and get it to the President's desk.\"\n\nBut Harris was not always so eager to scrutinize officers' behavior or push for attorney general reviews of police misconduct when she was California's top law enforcement official, documents reveal.\n\nThe Daily Poster has found that when Harris was California's attorney general, she did not investigate the fatal shootings of two unarmed men by the same Anaheim police officer less than a year apart, despite calls from the city's mayor and members of the public following the second. Instead, she left the task up to the Orange County District Attorney's office, which was embroiled in a misconduct scandal and notorious for letting officers off the hook.\n\nAt the time, Harris suggested her office would review the findings of the district attorney's office, but the Daily Poster found no evidence that a serious review of the DA report ever took place. The Anaheim police officer, Nick Bennallack, remained on the force for years - and went on to kill again.\n\nThe City of Anaheim has already had to spend several hundred thousand dollars in lawsuit payouts over Bennallack's conduct; a civil rights lawsuit filed late last year over his latest killing is still ongoing.\n\nHarris has enjoyed a trailblazing career in politics. In January, the Los Angeles Times even started a beat dedicated to her historic rise to the White House. The fifty-six-year-old politician of Jamaican and South Asian descent has already written herself into the history books as the first woman to serve as San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general, and now vice president of the United States. She was also the first black person to have represented California in the US Senate. Now, she is one heartbeat away from the presidency and could be a serious future presidential contender, too.\n\nBut as remarkable as Harris's career is, it has not been without controversy. During her 2020 presidential run, Harris attempted to paint herself as a progressive prosecutor, but critics pointed out that she had embraced the mantle of California's \"top cop\" and done little as DA or attorney general to challenge law enforcement power structures, instead pursuing low-level offenses like truancy and drug possession .\n\nHer reluctance to push for more police accountability appears to have extended to failing to investigate an officer with a troubling record at a time when doing so could have prevented killings down the line.\n\n\"She neglected a lot of cases in California,\" says Genevieve Huizar, the mother of Manuel Angel Diaz, one of the men subsequently killed by Bennallack. \"Why she didn't get involved in these shootings, I don't know.\"\n\nThe first unarmed man in Anaheim that Officer Bennallack killed was Filipino-American father Bernie Villegas.\n\nVillegas had been shooting a Red Ryder Daisy BB rifle in the parking lot of his West Ball Road apartment complex with a friend on January 7, 2012. He had bought the toy as a present for his fourteen-year-old son, who was inside. A neighbor had called the police, warning about a suspected drug dealer loitering with a gun. Bennallack was one of the responding officers. When they arrived, they found Villegas leaning against the gun, holding it from the barrel.\n\nThe officers ordered him to show his hands. Villegas complied but did not let go of the barrel of the BB gun. Bennallack unloaded five rounds without warning . Officers would say they thought the toy was a shotgun.\n\nSeven months later, Bennallack killed again.\n\nHe and another officer were on patrol in Anaheim near the 700 block of North Anna Drive on July 21, 2012, when they found twenty-five-year-old Manuel Diaz leaning into a car window in an alleyway. Bennallack did not recognize Diaz , court records say.\n\nThe officers ordered everyone to stop what they were doing, but Diaz fled. The officers would later say they suspected criminal activity based on his baggy clothes, location, and behavior. Bennallack gave chase briefly before drawing his service weapon and shooting Diaz twice - once in the buttock, once in the back of the head - outside a nearby apartment complex. Video shows that as the young man lay dying on the ground, Bennallack applied handcuffs rather than administer aid. Diaz later died at the hospital.\n\nThe Orange County DA noted in its report that Diaz was a \"self-admitted\" gang member with prior gun and drug convictions, and had drugs in his system at the time, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals would later decide in a lawsuit on the matter that such information had \"marginal, if any\" relevance to liability and damages in the case.\n\nThe report also noted that the incident occurred in a so-called \"Safety Zone.\" The City of Anaheim was in the controversial practice of issuing \"gang injunctions,\" designating whole blocks as quarantine zones where even mundane activities were restricted. Officers were also empowered to add names to a database of supposed gang members without oversight. Civil liberties advocates pointed out that removing names from that list was nearly impossible and that black youth, in particular, were targeted.\n\nHuizar, Diaz's mother, described the hole his death left in her family, noting it stripped her of her youngest child and only son. She cannot talk about what happened without tears nine years later.\n\n\"He's laying on the ground and they turn him over with a bullet in his head and they handcuff him,\" she says.\n\nBennallack would later claim that he saw Diaz reaching for his waistband and throwing an object nearby during the chase that he thought had been a gun. The only item found near the scene was a cell phone. The next day, another Latino man, Joel Acevedo, was fatally shot by Anaheim police. The two killings were the latest in a string of fatalities by police in Anaheim, a city probably best known as the home of Disneyland. The deaths sparked widespread protests and riots in the city, some of which were met with force by law enforcement.\n\nIn the wake of the turmoil, Bennellack earned a pejorative nickname: \" Backshot .\"\n\nIn 2011, Harris became California's attorney general. She'd run on her bonafides as San Francisco district attorney prosecuting violent crimes and crimes against children, and focused on her past as the daughter of two civil rights activists who \"spent full-time marching and shouting about this thing we call justice.\" Harris would tell reporters that the heroes for her of the civil rights era were the lawyers.\n\nHarris had a chance to seek justice the next year.\n\nThe July 2012 shootings and subsequent unrest sparked a scramble for accountability in Anaheim. While the Office of the Orange County District Attorney would investigate the incidents, as was routine for police shootings, the Anaheim city council asked the Office of the US Attorney and the FBI to conduct independent investigations into the matter and hired the Office of Independent Review (OIR), a contractor that looks into police departments, to examine its police force.\n\nAnaheim mayor Tom Tait also asked Harris's office to conduct an independent review of the most recent two shootings. At the time, Tait told the press , \"Whatever the truth is, we will own it.\" The national Latino advocacy group Presente.org echoed Tait's appeal to Harris in a petition with more than seventeen thousand digital signatures.\n\nTait and the public had valid reasons for asking Harris's office to get involved. In 2000, California became the first state to grant its attorney general the authority to intervene in law enforcement misconduct cases. Legal experts say such interventions can offer a greater level of scrutiny and objectivity than other kinds of police audits.\n\nReviews by local district attorneys are often seen as unreliable since the attorneys work closely with law enforcement in ways that could create conflicts of interest. And while the Department of Justice has authority under the 1994 crime bill to conduct reviews of potential systemic police abuses, such investigations have limitations . The agency lacks the power to subpoena internal documents from local police departments and has been hobbled by chronic underfunding.\n\nCalls mounted, therefore, for Harris to investigate. Protesters gathered outside her Sacramento office. Huizar was among them, demanding justice for her son.\n\nAt first, the efforts appeared successful. In July 2012, four days after Tait's request, the mayor told the Orange County Register that the attorney general had agreed to investigate the shootings.\n\nBy October, however, Harris's office suggested the investigation might not happen.\n\n\"We are advised that the Orange County District Attorney's office is conducting a thorough examination into all of these incidents. Once that review is completed we can best evaluate what if any involvement by this office is appropriate,\" her office's press secretary Lynda Gledhill said .\n\nSpeaking to the New York Times in August 2020, Tait recalled receiving a phone call from Harris two days after he asked her to intervene, denying his request.\n\nIn March 2013, the district attorney's office released its report on the shootings, finding Bennallack was justified in shooting Diaz.\n\nEvidently, Harris's office was satisfied with the DA's findings. A Daily Poster public records request with the California Office of the Attorney General turned up no records of any investigations or findings related to the Villegas, Diaz, or Acevedo shootings. Nor did it turn up any communications related to the shootings between the attorney general's office and the Anaheim Police Department, the local DA, or the Office of the US Attorney.\n\nAdditionally, a public records request to the Orange County DA's office yielded no records of communications between them and Harris's office.\n\nSimilarly, the FBI declined to conduct a full investigation into the shootings, telling OC Weekly that it planned on merely reviewing the DA's report. The Daily Poster 's public records request to the DA turned up no records of communications with the Office of the US Attorney over the killings.\n\nThe OIR's report , released in 2015, recommended several changes to Anaheim Police Department policy, including shortening the forty-eight-hour waiting period to interview officers after shootings and updating rules regarding police pursuits.\n\nDiaz's family, meanwhile, filed a lawsuit against the city and the police department over his shooting. After the DA's office released its report allowing Bennallack to remain on the force, the attorney representing the family, Dana Douglas, told reporters she believed the officer would likely repeat his behavior.\n\n\"Unfortunately someone like Nick Bennallack, with a nervous disposition and a quick trigger finger, can get onto the Anaheim Police Department and nothing happens, said Douglas. \"He's out there today ready to shoot a third victim.\"\n\nTwo years after the Diaz killing, Bennallack, who had been moved to the SWAT team, was involved in a third fatal police shooting. He was of five officers who shot and killed Steen Thomas Parker. Parker was white and engaged in a firefight with officers. Parker had previously been arrested for rape , according to the Orange County DA report, which cleared Bennallack and his colleagues of any wrongdoing in the shooting.\n\nIn April 2019, after Harris had moved from attorney general to US senator, Bennallack fatally shot another unarmed Latino man. Thirty-year-old father Daniel Ramirez III had been at a garage where Irvine police were attempting to serve a search warrant for theft of guitars and amplifiers from a vehicle. The situation had led Ramirez and another man to barricade themselves in an attic. That's where they were when members of the Anaheim SWAT team - including Bennallack - arrived.\n\nBody cam footage released by the Orange County DA shows that Ramirez and the other man initially refused to come down while officers fired pepper balls into the attic. The men threatened to shoot back, but soon Ramirez's colleague surrendered to police without incident.\n\nAfter a twelve-minute standoff, Ramirez relented and descended from the attic, pleading with the officers not to shoot him. While he was out of view of the officers' body cameras, according to the district attorney's later review of the incident, Ramirez then refused to surrender and instead turned to run deeper into the garage. At that point, an officer fired a nonlethal round that struck Ramirez in the right lower back. In the footage, Ramirez is heard screaming in pain. Seconds later, Bennallack is seen firing four live rounds in rapid succession. After a brief pause, he fired a fifth time.\n\nParamedics attempted to revive Ramirez, but could not save him. He was unarmed, although two loaded weapons were found elsewhere in the garage according to the Orange County DA.\n\nFor Ramirez's younger stepbrother Levi - who asked to be identified as Levi Ramirez Dixon because \"he's my step-brother but he feels like blood\" - the killing is raw and unforgivable.\n\n\"Everyone in our family is missing a part of their heart because they've lost Daniel,\" he says.\n\nDixon acknowledges that Ramirez struggled as he got older, and had done time in jail. He says he once saw Ramirez with a gun, but never thought of him as dangerous. He says Ramirez loved his daughter \"more than anything,\" and the six-year-old girl has taken the loss of her father hard.\n\nLast June, Dixon and his family marched on the Anaheim Police Department. Dixon had hoped to talk to Bennallack, but when they arrived, the building was barricaded and nobody came outside.\n\n\"It was almost like a second death,\" he says.\n\nDixon says he has lost complete faith in law enforcement and does not want to call the police for help again.\n\nOnce again, the Orange County DA's office cleared Bennallack for killing Ramirez. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who succeeded Harris and is now Biden's nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, did not appear to investigate the matter, as his office told the Daily Poster it had no records regarding any investigation.\n\nIn each of Bennallack's three killings of unarmed individuals over eight years, the local district attorney's office cleared him of all wrongdoing, and the attorney general's office never once got involved.\n\nWhen state legislation came up in 2014 that would have required the attorney general's office to conduct independent investigations into police shootings, Harris spoke out against the bill on the grounds that it took prosecutorial power away from local district attorney offices.\n\n\"I don't think it would be good public policy to take the discretion from elected district attorneys,\" she said .\n\nBut in the case of Orange County, the district attorney's office might not have deserved Harris's deference.\n\nAt the time, the office was helmed by Tony Rackauckas , who was described in 2018 by ACLU attorney Brendan Hamme as \"one of the most scandal-ridden and criticized government figures in California.\"\n\nThose scandals included a systematic jailhouse snitch scheme and the practice of routinely withholding evidence from defense attorneys.\n\nThe jailhouse-snitch revelations came to light in 2011, causing a judge to recuse the entire DA's office from the death penalty case of Scott Dekraai, the man behind Orange County's worst mass shooting - a decision Harris's office unsuccessfully appealed . As OC Weekly put it , the scandal led to at least twenty felony cases in the office being tainted by the hint of corruption. Harris's office would eventually launch a probe into the scandal in 2015. That ended four years later under Becerra without explanation .\n\nOne of the figures at the center of the affair, Dan Wagner, was the same assistant district attorney who twice helped clear Bennallack of wrongdoing, first by signing off on the Villegas shooting report , then by authoring the subsequent Diaz shooting report . In December 2019 , Wagner left the DA's office amid further scandal. Internal whistleblower complaints alleged he had engaged in covering up misconduct .\n\nThe 2019 shooting report clearing Bennallack in the death of Ramirez fell to a different assistant district attorney: Andrew Bugman. He, too, has been caught up in the controversy. Bugman defended the concealment of impeachment materials related to the jailhouse-snitch scandal by Rackauckus's successor, DA Todd Spitzer.\n\nIn 2017, a jury awarded Diaz's family $200,000 over his death, finding that Bennallack had used excessive force in the shooting. A year later, however, in a lawsuit brought by the family of the first man Bennallack killed, Bernie Villegas, a jury found in favor of the police.\n\nFederico Sayre, the attorney who represented Villegas's family in that case, told the Daily Poster that the Orange County DA's office \"always\" clears police officers in shootings and that it's very difficult to get a jury to rule in favor of victims' families.\n\nA review by the Daily Poster of 253 incident reports listed on the Orange County DA's website in which someone was either shot by police or died while in police custody between January 2010 and March 2020 found that prosecutors cleared the law enforcement personnel involved every time.\n\nBennallack is no longer employed by the City of Anaheim, according to Sgt Shane Carringer. Carringer said he could not provide other information about Bennallack, but noted the separation occurred months ago.\n\n\"I don't think it's quite been a year,\" Carringer said.\n\nMoving forward, all incidents similar to those in which Bennallack had been involved will be investigated by the state's top prosecutor. In September 2020, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law requiring the state attorney general to investigate all fatal police shootings of unarmed individuals.\n\nBecerra, like his predecessor Harris, opposed the idea. He called an early version of the bill \"untenable and unreasonable\" due to the monetary cost to his office.\n\nThe same month the bill was signed, Ramirez's family filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against Bennallack, the City of Anaheim, and the City of Irvine over his death. Dale Galipo, the lawyer behind the case, was the same civil rights attorney who represented Diaz's family.\n\nResponding to an inquiry whether or not he felt the state's justice system had failed Diaz and Ramirez, Galipo gave a one-word answer: \"Yes.\"\n\nHuizar, Diaz's mother, works to find strength in family and religion. But she says she will bear the pain of losing her son for the rest of her life.\n\n\"You kinda have to live life without him, but he was a really good son,\" she says, her voice breaking. \"He was just the light of our family.\"\n\nHuizar usually avoids politics and never considered Harris particularly responsible for her family's pain. But given Harris's lack of response to her son's killing when she was attorney general, the vice president's recent posturing as an advocate for police accountability strikes her as hypocritical.\n\nHarris, she says, \"should have done a better job.\"\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Daily Poster , here .\n\nWalker Bragman is a journalist and JD whose work has been featured in Paste Magazine , the Intercept , HuffPost , the Independent , Salon , Truthout , and the Hill .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

We need to divert funding for police into funding for human needs.\n\nPolice in riot gear at Ferguson, MO protests, August 13, 2014.\nJamelle Bouie / Wikimedia\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWe are at an important moment in the debates over police reform.\n\nWith Donald Trump in the White House and Jeff Sessions heading the Department of Justice, many liberals see a profound threat to the push for police accountability. These reformers tend to have the ear of urban mayors, large criminal justice reform organizations, and the media. Their agenda prioritizes new technology for police such as body cameras and mobile smart phones, additional training to reduce bias and deescalate conflicts, more diversity within the ranks, new forms of community policing , and accountability mechanisms such as civilian review boards.\n\nAt the same time, there is a growing chorus of voices that question the standard suite of liberal reforms and instead demand more far-reaching changes. Often growing out of the prison abolition movement, these figures see policing as an extension of coercive state power that buttresses social inequalities. Organizations like Black Youth Project 100, Critical Resistance, and The Youth Justice Coalition call for a variety of de-policing measures that would shift funding for police into funding for youth programs and economic development.\n\nSimilarly, an increasing number of academics are providing more in-depth analyses of the injustices that underlie modern policing. Andrea Ritchie, in Invisible No More , details the horrible abuses that police mete out on women and girls of color in schools, on the street, at the border, and in the home, and concludes that \"true safety for women of color requires an end to the 'war on drugs,' broken windows policing, and the 'war on terror.'\" Paul Butler, in his powerful new book Chokehold , insists that prisons and police must be replaced with institutions that actually help communities of color.\n\nFor these organizers and scholars, the aim of police reform - as community activist Rachel Herzing aptly puts it - \"should not be to improve how police function but to reduce its role in our lives.\"\n\nI grew up on shows like Adam-12 that portrayed police as dispassionate enforcers of the law. This was the Hollywood of the sixties and seventies, when, in the wake of the 1965 Watts Rebellion, the media industry busied itself manufacturing a professional image for the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nToday, we are awash in police dramas and reality TV shows with a similar ethos and purpose. While some are more nuanced than others, by and large these shows portray the police as struggling to fight crime in a complex and at times morally contradictory environment. Even when they depict police as corrupt or brutal, as in Dirty Harry or The Shield , the underlying message is the same: police officers are there to get the bad guys.\n\nBut this is largely a liberal fantasy. As the veteran police scholar David Bayley argues ,\n\nThe police do not prevent crime. This is one of the best kept secrets of modern life. Experts know it, the police know it, but the public does not know it. Yet the police pretend that they are society's best defense against crime and continually argue that if they are given more resources, especially personnel, they will be able to protect communities against crime. This is a myth.\n\nLiberals' reform agenda stems from a belief that police are the legitimate mechanism for using force in the interests of the whole society. For them, the state, through elections and other democratic processes, represents the general will of the public as well as any system could; those who disregard the resulting rules, therefore, should face the police.\n\nThis is not to say that liberals give police carte blanche. They insist that police officers have an obligation to act in a way that the public respects and is in keeping with the rule of law. That is what separates police in a liberal democracy from those in a dictatorship.\n\nNor do liberals believe that US policing is without problems: they readily acknowledge that officers sometimes violate the public's trust. But they see such failings as individual missteps that can be rectified through disciplinary procedures or improvements to training and oversight.\n\nIf entire police departments are found to be discriminatory, abusive, or unprofessional, then measures can be put in place to stamp out bias and bad practices through training, changes in leadership, and a variety of oversight mechanisms. Racist and brutal cops can be purged from the profession and an unbiased system of law enforcement can be reestablished. For liberals, police reform is always a question of what steps to take to restore law enforcement's rightful legitimacy.\n\nReforming police forces to make them better trained, more accountable, and less racist are all laudable goals. But they leave intact the basic institutional functions of the police, which have never really been about public safety or crime control.\n\nThis misdiagnosis has long plagued the liberal reform project. As political scientist Naomi Murakawa points out , it was liberals' willingness to ignore the profound legacy of American racism that helped yield the inadequate police and criminal justice reforms of the past. Rather than admit the central role of slavery and Jim Crow in both producing wealth for elite whites and denying basic life opportunities for blacks, liberals pushed a few modest social measures - backed up by a harsh criminal justice system that was supposed to transform black people's behavior so they could better compete in the labor market. Their solution to crime wasn't a massive jobs program, but a little more welfare spending and a lot more punitive policing.\n\nMeanwhile, there was little discussion about whether the police were being asked to fix problems they were ill suited to solve.\n\nIf liberals are wrong-headed about police, what's a more accurate way to view their role in society?\n\nSimply put, the primary function of the police is to manage (and even produce) inequality by suppressing social movements and tightly controlling the behaviors of poor, working class, and nonwhite people - those on the losing end of economic and political arrangements. Police exist to \" fabricate social order ,\" in the words of scholar Mark Neocleous, but that order rests on systems of exploitation.\n\nAmerican capitalism isn't organized to represent the interests of everybody - it's organized first and foremost around profit. Economic elites exercise enormous influence over the political process, and the police enforce the laws that are then churned out. Even with the democratic gains that popular movements have made (for instance, winning the right to vote and the right to unionize), the police still function as a violent imposition in oppressed communities - not as a benign entity, simply enforcing laws that society has collectively agreed upon. Police, Kristian Williams notes , \"represent the point of contact between the coercive apparatus of the state and the lives of its citizens.\"\n\nWhen possible, the police aggressively and proactively prevent the formation of movements that pose a threat to this order, but when necessary they fall back on brute force. What's important is that the prevailing arrangement is maintained.\n\nThis dynamic is nothing new. In fact, it accounts for the rise of the police.\n\nAs David Bayley has detailed, modern policing emerged in the eighteenth century when political and economic developments produced social upheavals that couldn't be defused by existing private, communal, and informal processes. Popular demands for justice were met with expanded state power.\n\nWhile the specific form of policing has changed in response to the shifting forms of resistance - whether slave revolts, general strikes, or crime and rioting in the streets - its basic function has persisted: managing the poor, foreign, and nonwhite on behalf of a system of economic and political inequality.\n\nThe past few decades have witnessed a dramatic expansion in the scope and intensity of police activity. More police are engaged in more enforcement of more draconian laws, sending incarceration, economic exploitation, and abuse sky high. This expansion mirrors the rise of mass incarceration, which in turn sprang from a set of economic and political crises.\n\nIn the 1960s and '70s, politicians were anxious to find new ways to harness the support of white voters in the wake of the Civil Rights Movement. As Michelle Alexander and others have pointed out, Richard Nixon used \"law and order\" rhetoric to stoke racist fears and convince many Southern whites to vote Republican for the first time since Reconstruction. Following the resounding defeat of presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988 for being \"soft on crime,\" Democrats came to fully embrace this strategy too, leading to disasters like Bill Clinton's 1994 crime bill, which added tens of thousands of additional police and stepped up the drug and crime wars.\n\nAmerica's changing economic realities have played a central role in this process as well. In the early 1980s, the deep recession created a new, mostly African-American, permanent underclass, largely excluded from the formal economy. In response, government mobilized at all levels to manage this new \"surplus population\" through intensive policing and mass incarceration. As unemployment, poverty, and homelessness increased, government, police, and prosecutors worked together to criminalize huge swaths of the population, aided by ideologies like broken-windows theory and the superpredator myth.\n\nFor poor and working-class people, particularly in nonwhite communities, police became an increasingly pervasive, and increasingly aggressive, presence.\n\nOf course, police do more than suppress social movements and crack down on poor people. Police today are clearly concerned with matters of public safety and crime control, however misguided their methods might be. Compstat and other management techniques are designed to address serious crime problems, and significant resources go into these efforts.\n\nBut this crime-fighting orientation is itself a form of social control. From Jonathan Simon's Governing Through Crime to Michelle Alexander's The New Jim Crow , there is extensive research to show that what counts as crime and what gets targeted for control is shaped by concerns about racial and class inequality and the potential for social and political upheaval.\n\nThe criminal justice system excuses and ignores the crimes of the rich - even those that produce profound social harms - while criminalizing the behaviors of the poor and nonwhite, including those behaviors that produce few social harms. And when the crimes of the rich are addressed, it's generally through administrative controls and civil enforcement rather than aggressive policing, criminal prosecution, and incarceration. No bankers have been jailed for the 2008 financial crisis, even though their often blatantly fraudulent actions resulted in mass unemployment, homelessness, and economic dislocation.\n\nAmerican crime control is a system based around managing the \"dangerous classes\" that masquerades as a system of justice.\n\nIndeed, police today are not that far removed from their colonialist forebears. They too enforce a system of laws designed to reproduce and maintain economic inequality, usually along racialized lines. The most damning example of this is the War on Drugs , in which millions of mostly black and brown people have been ground through the criminal justice system, their lives destroyed and their communities destabilized, without reduction in the use or availability of drugs.\n\nWhile the police will often go through the motions of crime control - though not always - it is through a lens of class and race skepticism if not outright animus. And while individual officers may not harbor deep biases - though many do - the institution's ultimate purpose has always been one of containing the poor and nonwhite, rather than producing anything resembling true justice.\n\nIt is understandable that people have come to look to the police to provide them with safety and security. Poor people in particular bear the brunt of street crime, and after decades of neoliberal austerity, local governments have no will or ability to pursue the kinds of ameliorative social policies that might address crime and disorder without the use of armed police.\n\nAs mental health facilities close, police become the first responders to calls for assistance in mental health crises. As young people are left without adequate schools, jobs, or recreational facilities, they form gangs for mutual protection or participate in the black markets of stolen goods, drugs, and sex to survive and are then criminalized. As poverty deepens, housing prices rise, and government support for affordable housing evaporates, police adopt aggressive, \"broken windows\" policing.\n\nAny program to reduce crime and enhance social well-being, much less achieve racial justice, must address these conditions. But the answer isn't more police and jails.\n\nThese communities need more political power and resources to develop their own strategies for reducing crime. The money that would be saved by keeping people out of prison could be spent on drug and mental health services, youth programs, and jobs in the community. At the same time, offenders could be asked to make restitution to their victims and the community through community service projects, agreements to stay clean and sober, and participation in appropriate programming.\n\nBut not all problems can be solved at this level. Access to decent housing and employment and the ongoing problems of polarized income structures and racial discrimination in housing must be dealt with systemically. Raising the minimum wage, restoring transit links, and cracking down on housing discrimination are big problems that operate largely outside these poor neighborhoods.\n\nThe Black Youth Project in Chicago envisions a program for economic development that would substantially improve the lives of people in high-crime communities as an alternative to relying on police and prisons. Their \" Agenda to Build Black Futures \" calls for reparations and decent jobs that can sustain a family above the poverty line.\n\nThe Movement for Black Lives has also outlined a plan for economic and political justice that includes greater investment in schools and communities based on priorities developed by black communities. At the heart of their program is a set of economic justice proposals, including reparations, which would reduce inequality, enhance individual, family, and community wellbeing, and protect the environment. They call for major jobs programs, restrictions on Wall Street rapaciousness, and vigorous protections of workers' rights.\n\nRural areas need help as well. The growth in opioid use is closely linked to the downward mobility of the rural poor and the advent of the War on Drugs. While simplistic protectionism and jingoistic anti-immigrant mania are unlikely to bring long-term stability, rural areas could become more economically sustainable and livable with green jobs, infrastructure development, and nontoxic food production. Reducing subsidies to multinational corporations that move jobs overseas to countries with little in the way of labor rights or environmental protections would also be a good start.\n\nModern policing is largely a war on the poor that does little to make people safer or communities stronger. Even when it does, this is accomplished through the most coercive forms of state power, destroying the lives of millions. Instead of asking the police to solve our problems, we must organize for real justice. We need to win a society designed to meet people's human needs, rather than one ordered around the pursuit of private wealth at the expense of everything else.\n\nAlex S.

Fleegler (University of North Carolina Press, 2023).\n\nJust days before Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis and Vice President George H. W. Bush faced off for the White House in the 1988 election, journalist Chris Wallace intoned on the Sunday talk show Meet the Press , \"a lot of people are saying this has been the worst presidential campaign in memory. The most negative, the worst of choice of candidates.\"\n\nDespite that grim assessment, the 1988 race has largely been forgotten - remembered, if at all, through a series of phrases like \" Monkey Business ,\" \" No New Taxes ,\" and \" Willie Horton \" that operate as floating signifiers with little connection to the election itself. Academics, too, have largely ignored the race, focusing instead on the more significant and realigning elections of 1980 and 1992. In Brutal Campaign: How the 1988 Election Set the Stage for Twenty-First-Century American Politics , historian Robert L. Fleegler sets out to change that view, and in doing so offers an essential reassessment of the neglected contest.\n\nWith notable exceptions - think Rick Perlstein 's engrossing trilogy of the rise of the modern US right - books about campaigns have largely been the domain of reporters and insiders, often published in the immediate aftermath of the election. Fleegler lacks the journalistic vantage point of Theodore White ( The Making of the President series) or the gonzo style of Hunter Thompson ( Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72 ). But his position of remove enables him to take a scholar's approach to the topic, culling material from archival sources not available at the time of the election and from interviews with many of the campaign principals, including Susan Estrich (Dukakis's campaign manager) and Bush adviser Charlie Black (of the infamous firm Black, Manafort, and Stone).\n\nThe most notable (and arresting) original material comes from a 2017 interview the author conducted with Dukakis. It is one of Dukakis's most candid and extensive reflections about the election, featuring everything from comments on Gary Hart's sex life (\"[if you go into public service] have a good but conventional sex life\") to admissions of campaign missteps (\"I made a very serious mistake and it was my decision. Nobody else's. That we would not [respond] to the Bush attack campaign\").\n\nThe benefit of hindsight enables Fleegler to argue for the significance of '88, showing how the election reflected many of the larger social and political developments of the 1970s, especially the restructuring of the US economy and workforce. He also suggests that the election introduced a series of new approaches to US campaigns, including opposition research and \"soft money\" contributions, which are workarounds to the cap on individual donations. These would forever reshape presidential bids. Perhaps the most significant change occurred in media, with the rise of cable news, the press's tabloid-esque commitment to exposing unseemly parts of candidates' personal lives, and the dizzying barrage of advertisements, many funded by shadowy \"independent\" committees (the precursor to super PACs).\n\nBy reconstructing the 1988 election from primary to general in painstaking detail, Brutal Campaign reveals how Bush's decisive win - 53.4 to 45.7 percent of the popular vote, 426 electoral votes to 111 - was hardly foreordained. The first half of the book looks at the primaries, which on both sides boasted crowded fields that featured Al Gore, Jesse Jackson, Joe Biden, Bob Dole, and even a brief appearance by Donald Trump. Fleegler reminds us often-forgotten moments, such as the flak over the similarities between a Biden speech and that of a British Labour Party leader, and the campaign of televangelist Pat Robertson, who launched his bid in front of a booing crowd in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, but who would come in second in the Iowa caucuses. Perhaps reflecting the nature of the primary process - and paralleling what would happen in the 2020 Democratic primary - it was the two most vanilla candidates who ultimately emerged victorious.\n\nBrutal Campaign joins a series of works (my own included) that have sought to demonstrate that Dukakis was hardly the lefty that Bush painted him to be and that history has remembered him as. Rather, he was the quintessential \" Atari Democrat \" - more in line with the pro-business centrism of the Democratic Leadership Council than the prolabor liberalism of the New Deal. As governor of Massachusetts, Dukakis promoted a technocratic agenda of work-based welfare reform and private sector-led growth. He centered his campaign around the successful tech-driven revival of the Massachusetts economy known as the Massachusetts Miracle. Throughout his 1988 run he praised the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA, later passed under Bill Clinton), stating in the first Democratic primary debate: \"More trade is better than less trade. That ought to be our governing policy.\"\n\nYet Brutal Campaign is more than a lengthy examination of Dukakis's policy positions. Fleegler details how the Bush campaign deftly shifted attention from its milquetoast message and cast Dukakis as an elitist Massachusetts liberal who was soft on crime, weak on defense, and an unpatriotic, \"card-carrying member of the ACLU\" that a decade earlier had vetoed a bill requiring teachers to lead students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Bush's bare-knuckle tactics drew directly from the playbook of his GOP predecessors Ronald Reagan and, especially, Richard Nixon: many Bush advisers (like Roger Ailes and Lee Atwater) had first cut their teeth on those campaigns. It is in fact less notable that they deployed this Nixonian tactic than that it worked in service of a patently blue-blood candidate like Bush (just as it would two decades later for a billionaire like Trump).\n\nThe clearest example of Bush's willingness to play dirty was the Willie Horton ad . The TV spot featured convicted murderer William \"Willie\" Horton, who escaped from prison while on a Massachusetts weekend furlough program and went on to rape a woman and stab her fiancé. The ad earned wide condemnation immediately for featuring a black man's mug shot in order to play on racial fears and is perhaps the quintessential example of dog-whistle politics. While the spot was technically produced by an independent committee, the Bush campaign's fingerprints were all over it. Fleegler closely tracks the ad's evolution, but he is also careful not to reduce Dukakis's defeat solely to this moment.\n\nThere were, after all, many other mistakes: from Dukakis's decision to take a break from campaign appearances during the summer of 1988 to attend to mundane business in Massachusetts, to his comically awful tank ride that was intended to prove his defense bona fides. Perhaps most costly of all, Fleegler writes, Dukakis said at the second debate that he would not favor the death penalty even for someone who raped and murdered his wife, Kitty Dukakis. His flat, emotionless tone, more than his staunch opposition to the death penalty, alienated the moderate voters whom he was working so hard to win over.\n\nDukakis's gaffe, coupled with the Willie Horton ad, convinced mainstream Democrats in subsequent election cycles to avoid appearing \"soft on crime\" at all costs. Bill Clinton's decision to return to Arkansas at the height of the 1992 presidential primaries to preside over the execution of Ricky Ray Rector , alongside the strong support among Democratic politicians for the 1994 crime bill (which directly fueled mass incarceration), both reveal the devastating consequences of the \"tough on crime\" turn. It also reminds us that politics and policy are often inseparable.\n\nFleegler's main goal is to highlight the parallels between 1988 and the contemporary political landscape. However, he does address one critical divergence: the number of undecided and unaffiliated voters in 1988 versus today. At key moments in the general election, there were large fluctuations in the polls, and many voters did not express strong loyalties. Fleegler contends that these dynamics spurred Bush and Dukakis to move their campaigns to the center and focus on swing voters rather than try to solidify support among their respective bases.\n\nHere, I wish Fleegler might have abandoned his dispassionate tone and analyzed the implications of the race to the middle. Brutal Campaign includes a long discussion of Dukakis's vice-presidential choice and notes that Jesse Jackson actively petitioned for the position, even flying to Boston just before the Democratic convention to have dinner with the Dukakis family on uly 4. Jackson had run a strong primary campaign on a left-wing platform of raising the corporate tax rate, enacting universal healthcare and other social investments, and supporting self-determination for Palestine; he had assembled a vibrant \"Rainbow Coalition\" of workers, farmers, and progressives of all colors.\n\nYet Dukakis selected Texas senator Lloyd Bentsen, a conservative businessman, who Dukakis believed could help attract swing voters and blunt Bush's \"Massachusetts liberal\" attacks. As Fleegler notes, Dukakis failed to foster much enthusiasm among African-American voters in the November election: while he received the overwhelming majority of the \"black vote,\" turnout was historically low. It's fair to assume that tapping Jackson, who had strong approval among black voters, would have generated more support. In addition, Jackson's agenda had earned staunch support from Bernie Sanders, who served as a campaign surrogate and would later say that Jackson's 1988 campaign was a major inspiration for his own presidential bids. It doesn't seem a stretch to suggest that Democrats' decision to lurch to the middle that year had reverberating effects on party politics and policy for more than thirty years.\n\nCounterfactuals are often pointless parlor games, and it can be a fool's errand to imagine what might have happened had Jackson won the Democratic nomination or had been the vice-presidential choice. Yet spotlighting Jackson's bid provides a chance to consider alternative ways of looking at the politics of the past beyond the rigidness of the two-party system. It also suggests ways to imagine a different type of campaign story and politics for the future.\n\nLily Geismer is an assistant professor of history at Claremont McKenna College and the author of Don't Blame Us: Suburban Liberals and the Trans­formation of the Democratic Party .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

You can now order a copy of this important new book direct from Jacobin for only $10, with free shipping.\n\nThey are not dealing with George McGovern. They are dealing with Joe Biden and Bill Clinton.\n\n-Joe Biden on the GOP and the issue of crime, 1994.\n\nBy 1993, for all intents and purposes, Joe Biden had won. Sure, his 1987 exit from the presidential campaign trail had been humiliating. But he had survived a near-death experience, returned to the Senate with renewed purpose, been sent back to Congress for another six years by the people of Delaware, and, with three terms and a prestigious committee chairmanship under his belt, was now one of the Democratic Party's most influential and powerful lawmakers.\n\nWhat's more, the party had moved exactly where he had been urging it to go. In 1992, Democrats nominated Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to be their presidential nominee, a business-friendly Southern Democrat who antagonized the party's left wing, held conservative stances on criminal justice and the role of the government, and connected with those same conservative, white, Reagan-backing voters who Biden was convinced needed to be the beating heart of the party.\n\nSince 1989, Clinton had been the chairman of the DLC, the conservative, Southern-dominated group determined to push the party rightward for which Biden had spent 1986 touring the country. Clinton had taken away many of the same lessons from his political career that Biden had from his. After becoming the country's youngest governor in 1978 and challenging the state's major industries, he had been unceremoniously tossed out of office two years later. He roared back in 1982, winning reelection and governing as a very different kind of politician - one far more accommodating to business interests and conservative views. He won the 1992 election not just by tapping into his preternatural charisma and empathy but by showing he could be just as ruthless and right wing as any Republican: he publicly scolded Jesse Jackson by misconstruing the words of an African American rapper attending his Rainbow Coalition convention as racist, and he flew home from the campaign trail to oversee the execution of a lobotomized inmate.\n\nClinton's guiding light was the philosophy of \"triangulation,\" otherwise known as the \"Third Way.\" Instead of going left or right, the theory went, Clinton would tread a path somewhere down the middle, much as Biden had spent his years in the Senate doing, voting largely as a Democrat but abandoning the party or taking conservative stances on key, consequential issues. In practice, this meant that Clinton and Biden, together with a cowed Democratic Party reeling after three consecutive presidential election losses, would spent the next eight years working with newly energized congressional Republicans to continue what Reagan had started: shrinking the size of government, rolling back protections for civil rights and liberties, cutting social programs and key regulations, and generally undoing the progress made under the New Deal and Great Society. \"He made clear he represents a new generation of leadership and government alone can't do it, and that is a new message from a Democrat,\" Biden said of Clinton as he prepared to take the oath.\n\nThe result was devastating for the US working class, as hundreds of thousands of Americans saw their jobs disappear, with only an increasingly frayed social safety net to fall back on. The march toward a repressive prison state sped up, while the gap between the rich and poor inflated. As these trends became more extreme, an ever-larger share of the voting public would conclude there was little point in taking part in the political system anymore.\n\nThe Reagan years may have been over, but their politics lived on. Biden, who like Reagan had spent the 1980s obsessed with federal deficits and cutting spending, would spend the next decade going even further in this direction.\n\nBiden emerged from his 1990 reelection slightly bruised by a scandal that showed yet again the peril of his and the rest of the party's increasing reliance on big-money donors. During his earlier presidential run, Biden had forged a friendship with David L. Paul, a Florida-based savings-and-loan executive and major Democratic fundraiser known to lend his private jet to politicians. Paul, his family, and his company's foundation had given generously to Biden, a fact seized on by his Republican opponent in the wake of the ongoing savings-and-loan crisis and after CenTrust, the bank Paul founded, which regulators charged he had used as \"his own piggy bank,\" collapsed, costing taxpayers more than $1 billion. It would later come out that, after being personally lobbied by Paul, Biden had successfully weakened the criminal penalties for bank fraud proposed in a pending bill to reform the sector; he had tried and failed to recruit Strom Thurmond for the effort.\n\nWhether it really was corruption wasn't clear: Paul had lobbied Biden to weaken a different part of the bill, Biden's chief of staff said, and the penalty reductions had actually been requested by smaller thrifts and banks. But Biden's financial and personal connections to a man of, in one regulator's words, \"insatiable vanity and greed\" who worked in an industry Biden was meant to be keeping in check wasn't a good look. It was a taste of what was to come.\n\nHaving locked down reelection, Biden, together with the DLC and other centrists, served as something of an ideological police force to keep an eye on Clinton, who they feared would govern as a New Deal Democrat. Though he had built a career kowtowing to right-wing forces, Clinton at heart still fancied himself one of Roosevelt's heirs, bitterly complaining to Democrats in 1993 that \"we're Eisenhower Republicans\" standing \"for lower deficits and free trade and the bond market. Isn't that great?\"\n\nAfter the election, Biden warned Clinton not to let his administration fall under the sway of liberals, singling out Bernard Nussbaum, the man who would become Clinton's general counsel, for particular attention - never mind that Nussbaum was a wealthy corporate lawyer. When a right-wing firestorm erupted over Clinton's nomination of civil rights lawyer Lani Guinier to head the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, partly as payback for the Thomas hearings, Biden joined the pile-on about her past academic writings, leading Clinton to cut her loose. His patience with liberal activists worn out by the previous decade's judicial battles, Biden lashed out at the \"idiotic groups out there,\" like the \"'XYZ Group for American Values,' or the 'QSY Group to Save All the Women in the World.'\"\n\nBiden wasn't responsible for Clinton's failure to reform US health care, but his lack of enthusiasm for the task didn't help. While behind the scenes, independent Vermont Rep. Bernie Sanders - who had parlayed his success in Burlington into a successful congressional campaign - tried pushing Clinton to pursue a single-payer health care system, White House officials and party leaders privately viewed Biden as \"noncommittal\" and \"someone who would 'take extra effort'\" to be won over to even Clinton's piecemeal reforms.\n\nInternal documents noted Biden's reservations about Clinton's plan, his private warnings not to load up any health care bill \"with too many bells and whistles,\" and his concerns \"that the benefit package may be too generous\" and would negatively impact small businesses. \"He has been one of the few Democratic members who have declined to sign Senator Wofford's universal coverage letter,\" read one memo written for First Lady Hillary Clinton, then leading the health care effort, adding that Biden had previously said he opposed single-payer. Biden himself later boasted that he had refused to sign on to Clinton's plan even after being beckoned to the White House.\n\nAs in the case of the CenTrust scandal during his 1990 reelection campaign, Biden's position may have been driven by powerful interests back home. One White House memo noted that DuPont, which Biden privately said controlled the Delaware Chamber of Commerce, would be \"key\" in his decision. Yet the company was advocating for national health insurance at the time. Maybe more key was the over $150,000 that Biden had got from health insurers over fifteen years. In any case, the reform failed, sunk by the White House's own mismanagement.\n\nWhile running full tilt away from anything hinting at liberalism, Biden gave Clinton full-throated backing as he continued Reagan's legacy. He proposed early on to have business experts advise Congress on how to streamline government agencies and endorsed Clinton's plan to lay off 252,000 federal workers. \"Putting the customer first will ensure that taxpayers get the service they deserve,\" he said, echoing the language of the era that cast government as a business and the public as its patrons.\n\nUltimately, in Clinton, Biden finally found a Democratic standard-bearer as passionate about attacking the deficit as he was. Despite polling showing the public was vastly more interested in job creation, Clinton upset his political advisers by kicking off his presidency with a deficit-cutting budget that slightly raised taxes on the very wealthiest while taking a big chunk out of government spending through federal layoffs and entitlement cuts. Clinton was fully conscious that this would block the ambitious social agenda he had actually campaigned on. The measure, which passed with only Democratic votes in the Senate, began a years-long campaign of deficit-cutting that culminated in the first balanced budget in decades. While universally lauded in media and political circles, the true significance of the balanced budget lay in further rolling back the New Deal. By the end of Clinton's two terms, federal spending fell to its lowest level since 1966, and the federal workforce accounted for the smallest percentage of overall employment since before Roosevelt took office.\n\nBiden cheered him on all the way. He told a constituent that Clinton's first budget was \"our best chance for deficit reduction\" and introduced his own six-year plan for balancing the budget. Even as Clinton accepted painful spending cuts dictated by the GOP, Biden proclaimed that \"we are approaching an historic moment\" and that Americans would \"enjoy real benefits from a balanced budget.\"\n\nWhich Americans though? Back home in Delaware, where federal money made up a large chunk of the state budget, Biden's constituents felt the sting. The state's Democratic governor Tom Carper warned in 1996 that his government would have to \"tighten its belt\" as a result, with a variety of programs, including scholarships, services for the elderly and disabled, drug and alcohol prevention, and emergency relief shelters, drastically cut back or wiped out, even as the number of homeless kids in Delaware had tripled over the previous decade. Delawareans pled with the state's finance committee to save vital programs on which they relied. While Biden continued earning top ratings from environmental groups, the cuts he supported imperiled Delaware's rivers and beaches and weakened the state's environmental programs and federal Environmental Protection Agency enforcement.\n\nBiden's zeal for cutting government brought previously untouchable targets into his crosshairs. He had cruised to reelection in 1990 through his tried-and-true playbook of outraising and out-Republicaning a mediocre opponent. His proposals included a \"freeze [on] all government spending until we get it in order,\" which would require the \"straight-up courage\" to cut everything - even Medicare and Social Security.\n\nThis is largely how it was for the rest of the decade. Biden repeatedly spoke out against GOP attempts to cut the big three - Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security - and commended Clinton by the end of his presidency for \"making the protection of Social Security and Medicare our highest domestic priority.\" Yet he also insisted that something had to be done about Medicare, pushing fraud prevention as a way to soften any future cuts, and he gave a tacit endorsement to a Medicaid \"reform\" plan put out by the National Governors Association in 1996 that would have given states \"discretion\" to deny benefits. On Social Security, he suggested raising the retirement age by one year and voted to repeal an earlier increase in benefits. This was in sharp contrast to his treatment of business: Biden had been first out of the gate to pressure Clinton to sign a bill in 1993 creating an antitrust exclusion protecting certain ventures from high damage awards.\n\nWe'll never know whether Biden would have defended these programs or folded to right-wing pressure to cut them: Clinton's plan to close out his presidency by \"reforming\" entitlements was derailed by the Monica Lewinsky scandal. But Biden's willingness to even rhetorically put these popular programs on the chopping block foreshadowed a new, more strident phrase of his antipathy to government spending.\n\nThis antipathy found its most radical expression in the form of the balanced budget constitutional amendment, which Biden had viewed as laughable and dangerous in previous decades. Now he was warming up to it. Its opponents viewed it with alarm: making a balanced federal budget a constitutional requirement would not only hamstring the government during times of emergency but require - even during economic downturns, when most economists advised more government spending and when spending cuts had historically plunged countries into even greater misery - the government to sharply raise taxes or, more likely, make drastic cuts to core, often life-saving programs.\n\nTo the relief of progressives and hundreds of economists, the amendment never passed under Clinton. But with the help of a wavering Biden, it came perilously close.\n\nWith the backing of its chairman, the Judiciary Committee started the decade by endorsing the amendment two years in a row. A 1991 report Biden issued warned that \"the spree of deficit spending by our federal government must be curbed.\" All the while he acknowledged it would be a disaster. \"This is a lousy amendment,\" he said in 1991. \"It's not a good idea - except I can't think of any other idea except maintaining the status quo. And the status quo stinks.\" Biden was, he explained, \"prepared to take what I consider radical medicine\" to tackle deficits.\n\nHad the constitutional amendment process been less onerous, the balanced budget amendment may well have passed several times in the mid-1990s. In 1994, Biden stayed undecided until the eleventh hour, when he and several other Democrats, including future presidential nominee John Kerry and future Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, came out against the amendment, causing it to fall four votes short of the sixty-seven needed to pass. Biden instead voted for a doomed alternative offered by Reid that insulated Social Security and construction projects from any painful cuts.\n\nThat sweetener was gone from the version that made it to the Senate floor the start of the following year, under a very different Congress and in a distinctly new political landscape. In between, the United States had experienced something of a political revolution, as a cadre of right-wing radicals, fed up with what they saw as the GOP's timidity and feebleness, took over the House, leaving both chambers of Congress in the Republicans' hands for the first time in forty years. In many ways, this was a more significant victory for the conservative movement than Reagan's had been in 1980. After all, it was Congress that shaped and passed legislation, and Reagan's vision had been largely stifled by Democratic control of the House throughout his presidency.\n\nThe George Washington of this victory was Georgia representative Newt Gingrich, who fancied himself \"the most serious, systematic revolutionary of modern times\" and called for \"large-scale, radical change.\" It was his \"Contract with America,\" a ten-point legislative plan that aimed to finish what Reagan had started, that victorious Republicans had signed and campaigned on. A balanced budget amendment was one of its key planks.\n\nWith the political calculus now altered, the Clinton administration toned down its opposition to the amendment. Even as Alice Rivlin, director of the Office of Management and Budget, warned that the amendment would \"exaggerate the boom-bust cycle,\" engineer \"worse recessions,\" and make for \"bad economic policy and bad constitutional policy,\" the White House made clear that it had lost the appetite to fight. Gingrich left a meeting with Clinton with the impression that he was \"not going to engage in an aggressive campaign against\" the measure.\n\nGingrich's confidence was likely rooted in the fact that many Democrats had become devoted converts. The 1995 version of the amendment, which required the prohibitively high threshold of three-fifths of both chambers of Congress to either raise the debt limit or pass a non-balanced budget, was sponsored and championed by Illinois's Paul Simon, one of the Senate's stalwart liberals, and backed by prominent Democrats like Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle and, of course, Biden.\n\n\"Something is going to come bouncing out of here and sent to the states [to be ratified],\" Biden said. The amendment had \"real flaws,\" he repeated, but vowed to back it because \"we need something.\" After several Democratic attempts to make it more forgiving failed, Biden and the rest of the committee, on a 15-3 vote, once more sent the amendment to the Senate.\n\n\"Some of us tried to make this a better proposal,\" he said as he prepared to vote for it. But he was \"faced with a choice of an imperfect amendment or continued spending,\" and he had \"sufficient confidence in our citizens and in our political institutions that we will confront any challenges\" from its many flaws.\n\nWhat those flaws and imperfections would mean in practice was stark. To make the spending cuts a balanced budget demanded, countless programs that Americans relied on would have to be cut or eliminated: low-income housing, heating assistance, federally funded school lunches, mass transit, even the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funded hundreds of TV and radio stations around the country, not to mention the big three entitlement programs. It would \"be a disaster for working people, for elderly people, for low-income people,\" Bernie Sanders had warned.\n\nIn the end, a sufficient number of Democrats were spooked by the threat posed to Social Security and other programs to defeat the amendment, including Daschle and even California's conservative senator Dianne Feinstein, both of whom had had been on board with the idea in 1994. But the decisions of Biden and two other Democrats to switch their votes in favor of the amendment brought it a mere two votes shy of the two-thirds majority needed for passage.\n\nBiden's support became even more determined as a result of his 1996 reelection contest. Once more, Biden faced an opponent who sought to paint him as an overly liberal flip-flopper. But businessman Ray Clatworthy was not only considered too far right by the Republican he had beaten in the primary; he was the first rival in Biden's career who could match him in fundraising. Despite political experts stressing his seat was one of the country's safest - borne out by his eventual 22-point margin of victory - Biden, per usual, moved right. While campaigning for reelection, he became one of just twelve Democrats to side with a near-unanimous GOP to again bring the balanced budget amendment within two votes of passage.\n\nEven after his reelection, Biden stayed the course. This time, with Clinton's second term in the bag, the measure faced stronger Democratic opposition. As the ground was readied for yet another vote in 1997, the White House lobbied key Democrats to reject the balanced budget amendment, and Clinton trashed it in his State of the Union speech, calling it \"unnecessary and unwise\" and warning that it could \"cripple our country in time of economic crisis.\" Biden, for his part, played unconvincingly coy. His spokesman told the press Biden would use his vote as leverage to make improvements to the measure, such as exempting Social Security - but then quickly added that Biden would vote for it no matter what, undermining any leverage he might have had.\n\nWhatever economic motivation Biden may have had to support the amendment was undercut when more than one thousand economists, including eleven Nobel Prize winners, signed a letter pleading with Congress not to adopt it. One economist, Nobel laureate James Tobin, cautioned it would \"put the federal government into a fiscal straitjacket\" during economic crises; another compared its insistence on keeping spending strictly below revenue to \"telling the Atlantic Ocean not to cross a line in the sand.\"\n\nDespite dithering in the days leading up to the vote, Biden voted for the third straight year to approve the amendment that even he - along with just about everyone outside of antigovernment, right-wing circles, including his local newspaper - had warned would bring economic catastrophe. He joined all fifty-five of the Senate's Republicans and just ten other Democrats. The amendment failed by just one vote. Against Biden's best efforts, disaster had been averted.\n\nBut if the American working class narrowly avoided the economic calamity of a balanced budget amendment, the same could not be said for a host of other measures passed by Biden and the Democratic Party during the 1990s.\n\nThe first came in 1991, as President George H W. Bush began working on what would come to be the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Despite a decades-long political career heavily underwritten by organized labor, Biden became one of a small group of Democratic turncoats that gave Bush \"fast track\" authority to negotiate the deal. AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland bitterly noted his \"disenchantment that on a great issue that affects the livelihood and survival of our constituents,\" the Democrats had deserted labor.\n\nNAFTA would ultimately be ratified under Clinton, who during his campaign had done a careful balancing act, backing the agreement to prove he could \"stand up to\" unions but pledging to improve it once in power. The \"improvements\" Clinton secured did little to assuage labor's fears, and Democrats like Biden were forced into a similar balancing act. Biden agonized over the decision, claiming in September 1993 that \"if I had to vote today, I would vote no,\" but also insisting he thought labor's \"theory\" that NAFTA would lead to an exodus of jobs to Mexico was \"flawed.\"\n\nHe stayed undecided until the very day of the vote two months later, ultimately charting a course that was vintage Biden. In his floor speech, he launched into a spirited attack on critics of unions: \"How dare we tell these people not to worry?\" he shouted. \"If you saw your future decimated, you would have every reason to be frightened. This is not a false fear.\" He then dismissed the arguments on both sides of the issue as \"vastly overblown,\" claiming labor only opposed NAFTA \"because they have nothing else\" to criticize. After only briefly explaining his support, he declared the agreement \"the best deal we are going to get now.\" With his vote and that of twenty-six other Democrats, NAFTA passed the Senate.\n\nBiden turned out to be grievously wrong. The deal not only caused the loss of nearly 700,000 US jobs, many of them in the country's manufacturing centers, but it further weakened the power of unions. It became a gift to unscrupulous businesses who used the threat of offshoring jobs to Mexico - in some cases, purposefully loading equipment into trucks headed south of the border in full view of disgruntled workers - to push employees into accepting worse wages, hours, and benefits, and to undermine unions' bargaining power. As Sanders had warned during the House debate on NAFTA, it was indeed \"a bad deal for American workers.\" Politically, the consequences would be just as grievous, as the loss of power for unions pushed the Democratic Party further into the arms of corporate donors, and Democrats saw an exodus of blue-collar support over the betrayal, creating a future opening for the party to be outflanked.\n\nNext came the euphemistically named \"welfare reform,\" what Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott later termed \"the Holy Grail of [the GOP's] legislative master plan.\" Conservatives had fantasized about dismantling the welfare system for decades. Reagan had memorably lobbed verbal broadsides at it during his 1976 presidential run, conjuring racialized images of a \"woman in Chicago\" scamming tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars and a \"strapping young buck\" using government handouts to buy a \"T-bone steak.\" Such deeply rooted caricatures had little relation to reality - in fact, the \"welfare queen\" stereotype was based on a career con woman with a much more complicated personal history - but they were potent images that seemed to confirm what many white Americans uncharitably suspected. More importantly, they were tied up with a centuries-old stereotype of African Americans as lazy and a post-1960s one of the poor as black and, as a result, lacking moral character.\n\nWelfare had never been a big focus of Biden's. He had gestured at vaguely doing something about it during his first campaign, but other liberal golden calves had always taken priority for him. By the late 1980s, however, he started to echo long-standing right-wing attacks on the system. \"We are all too familiar with the stories of welfare mothers driving luxury cars and leading lifestyles that mirror the rich and famous,\" he wrote in 1988. \"Whether they are exaggerated or not, these stories underlie a broad social concern that the welfare system has broken down - that it only parcels out welfare checks and does nothing to help the poor find productive jobs.\"\n\nThe legislation Biden was writing about, the Family Support Act, was a somewhat progressive measure. It strengthened the collection of child support, forced states to set up education, training, and job programs for people on welfare, and expanded childcare and Medicaid for families going from welfare to work. But by penalizing parents who either didn't take part in those programs or turned down any job offer, it chipped away at the welfare system in ways that would only intensify.\n\n\"There are some things, dammit, we have to change on,\" he told a group of Iowa Democrats in 1992. \"I don't know of a single person who says that welfare, the way it is, we like it.\" Biden kept using this language throughout the 1990s. He claimed that \"too many welfare recipients spend far too long on welfare and do far too little in exchange for their benefits,\" called for Congress to \"require all welfare recipients to sign a contract in which they agree to work in exchange for their benefits,\" and insisted they should have a limit of just six months to find a job before they lost their benefits.\n\nBy 1995, all the pieces to make this happen were in place. A radically right-wing, Republican-controlled Congress had just swept to power on the back of a promise to take on welfare. The Democrats were under the thrall of the DLC, which put welfare reform at the center of its policy goals. The president had promised to shrink the size of government and campaigned on ending \"welfare as we know it,\" and he had just hired a political operative whose grand strategy was to \"fast-forward the Gingrich agenda.\"\n\nThis was an agenda that, at least publicly, horrified Biden. He had thought about retiring, he told the 250-strong crowd at the annual Sussex County Democrats' spring dinner in 1995, but the GOP takeover of Congress had changed his mind. \"It's going over my dead political body that they succeed,\" he said, drawing the night's only moment of spontaneous, passionate applause. \"Newt Gingrich has energized Joe Biden. I'm looking forward to beating the hell out of the Republicans.\"\n\nThe core of the Republicans' vision of \"reform\" involved taking responsibility for welfare out of the hands of the federal government and putting it in the hands of the states in the form of block grants, funding packages they would be given complete discretion over. Biden understood some of the potential issues with this approach; he had attacked Reagan's 1982 proposal to turn over social and economic programs and the taxes behind them to the states, charging that \"the states, because of their own budget problems, are not going to fund these programs.\" Nevertheless, in September 1995, the newly \"energized\" Biden voted with fifty-two Republicans and thirty-four other Democrats to make the radical welfare overhauls that Gingrich had made the cornerstone of the Republican agenda. \"Generations have made welfare their way of life,\" he wrote in the Wilmington News Journal . \"This must end. It is simply unacceptable to me and most hard-working Americans.\"\n\nThe Senate's overwhelming passage of this measure sparked three months of pressure by progressive Democrats and activist groups to discourage Clinton's support for it. Come December, when the House and Senate versions were reconciled into what Democrats decried as far too cruel and punishing to children, all but one Senate Democrat voted against the final version, which Clinton vetoed. But Democrats were \"not going to quit,\" Daschle pledged in the vote's aftermath, and would \"continue to try to present alternatives.\"\n\nFar from \"beating the hell out of Republicans,\" what ultimately passed in 1996 was a poster child for the bipartisanship Washington so often celebrates. As Biden's fellow Delawarean in the House, Republican Michael Castle, teamed up with a Democrat to put forward a version of \"welfare reform\" supported by Clinton, Biden linked arms with another Republican, Arlen Specter, to introduce an identical version in the Senate. Castle thanked the two senators for \"lend[ing] credibility to our proposal.\" Delaware governor Carper (who is today a senator) said the proposal \"demonstrates that Democrats and Republicans can work together in the Congress.\"\n\nFor his part, Biden declared, \"It is time to say we do not care who gets credit for reforming welfare. It is time to just do it - in a bipartisan fashion - for the sake of the American people and for the sake of the people on welfare.\"\n\nThe Senate ultimately rejected Biden and Specter's bill for one that William Roth was pushing. But as Roth explained, Congress wasn't acting in the spirit of partisan competition. \"We're all working toward the same goals,\" he said. \"What has been lost in the shuffle and shouting of the last 10 months is that there is a great deal of common ground on welfare reform,\" affirmed Biden. When it came to a vote, six of the seven Democrats up for reelection that year, including Biden, helped send the bill to Clinton's desk with large bipartisan majorities even as angry protesters stormed the halls of Congress.\n\nClinton signed the bill on August 22, 1996, in the White House Rose Garden, surrounded by a bipartisan gaggle of delighted lawmakers. Lillie Harden, a black former welfare recipient from Clinton's hometown of Little Rock used by the bill's proponents as a living, breathing argument for the supposedly debilitating effects of welfare, stood by Clinton's side. Biden, who seven months earlier had said the \"Rush Limbaughs who got elected\" had got his \"juices going\" and strengthened his resolve to stay in Congress, was one of the small number of elected officials confirmed to attend.\n\nBut as the presence of protesters suggested, not everyone was happy. Ted Kennedy said that calling the measure \"reform is no more accurate than to call the demolition of a house 'remodeling.'\" Three of Clinton's assistant secretaries at the Department of Health and Human Services resigned in protest. Bernie Sanders would term the law \"the grand slam of scapegoating legislation.\" Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who had jumpstarted Lyndon Johnson's \"war on poverty,\" called welfare reform \"ruinous\" and \"grotesque,\" warning it would throw between one million and five million children into poverty.\n\nThe predictions were largely accurate. The numbers of Americans living in deep poverty climbed to well over two million by 2005, with single-parent families with kids hit the hardest. Twenty years on, the number of households living on less than $2 a day had doubled. State governments, increasingly controlled by Republicans and free to do what they wanted with welfare funding, drew on those block grants to plug their own budget deficits while virtually eliminating the welfare programs they so despised. Across the West and South, the welfare safety net virtually disappeared. In Biden's home state, the bill's freezing of welfare funding at 1994 levels kneecapped the Delaware government's welfare policy of putting more money into health care, day care, and job training. Meanwhile, Lillie Harden, who had had a stroke in 2002, died twelve years later at the age of fifty-nine, unable to get on Medicaid she had been while on welfare. Asked about the low-wage work she'd taken up that supposedly marked her successful transition from \"welfare dependency,\" she said: \"It didn't pay off in the end.\"\n\nThe push for \"welfare reform\" had revealed a fundamental truth of US politics: even as partisan gridlock and dysfunction began to take hold of the US political system during the 1990s, the American ruling class was more than capable of coming together to get things done as long as it flattered the interests of the country's most powerful and its victims were the working class. Just as with NAFTA, Biden and the Democrats' support for all this would in the long run further sever their link to the party's working-class base and swell the ranks of the disenchanted and politically disengaged.\n\nAt the same time Biden was helping conservatives continue their assault on the American working class, he was going to bat for Delaware's corporate sector.\n\nOver the course of the previous decades, Delaware had transformed into a \"bankruptcy haven,\" one whose lenient bankruptcy courts, known for hustling cases through at twice the speed of the rest of the country and favoring bankrupted companies over creditors, helped attract a rush of major corporations - or at least the legal papers incorporating them. Thanks to this and a package of corporate-friendly state banking laws passed in 1981, more than 60 percent of Fortune 500 companies were incorporated in the state by the end of the 1990s, though you would be hard-pressed to find any of those companies' stores or offices in Delaware. Bankruptcy was big business: the year before, 86 percent of bankruptcy filings by companies with $190 million or more in assets had been in the state, pumping money into local law firms and the surrounding economy. But the beneficiaries were chiefly suburbanites who commuted into Wilmington to occupy the city's proliferating white-collar jobs.\n\nThe rest of the country had taken notice. By 1998, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission, a panel of judges, lawyers, and professors formed in 1994, recommended a proposal - given the moniker \"The Delaware Killer\" in legal circles - to bar companies that didn't physically operate in states where they were incorporated to file for bankruptcy there.\n\nBiden was outraged. \"I cannot comprehend what purpose would be served by diverting cases from a court with such an accomplished record,\" he said, vowing to oppose the measure when it came to the Judiciary Committee. His and the rest of the Delaware delegation's outrage meant the measure never made it into a bill. \"It looks like Delaware has won the first round,\" Biden's state director said. Calling it \"a prestige thing\" for the state, Biden threatened one year later to filibuster a bill that tried to do the same; its author admitted defeat over Biden's \"intensity\" on the issue.\n\nBut when it came to easing the burden of bankruptcy on working Americans, Biden's intensity went the other way. As the decade came to a close, a coalition of banks and credit card companies began pushing a bill described by the Associated Press as \"the most far-reaching overhaul of the nation's bankruptcy laws in twenty years.\" With personal bankruptcies rising 300 percent since 1980 to hit an all-time high of 1.4 million eighteen years later - many of them due to credit card debt that banks were exacerbating by luring customers with high spending limits - the industry-favored legislation aimed to make it harder for ordinary Americans to file for bankruptcy. Biden swiftly became one of its champions.\n\nThe episode was a classic case of a politician protecting a local industry. Delaware at the time was home to no less than ten credit card banks employing 20,000 people, including MBNA, the second largest in the country. But there was more to it than this. MBNA, which complained it lost $1 billion a year under the existing bankruptcy regime, was by far the largest campaign contributor to all three of Delaware's members of Congress. By 1999, Biden had received $67,100 from its officials since 1991, less than his two colleagues but enough to earn him the label of \"the senator from MBNA.\" The connections went deeper than donations, too. Biden had sold his house for twice its value to one of those donors, MBNA's chief marketing officer, and his son Hunter had been hired straight out of law school in 1996 as a lobbyist for the company, zipping up the ranks to become senior vice president two years later.\n\nBiden backed the bill, introducing an identical version of what had passed the House, even as consumer groups lined up against it and Democratic lawmakers warned it would hurt families and children. Democrats attempted to derail it, while a Harvard professor named Elizabeth Warren personally lobbied First Lady Hillary Clinton to get her husband to veto it. The pushback succeeded, and the threat of Clinton's veto sunk the bill.\n\nOr at least it did for a time. The lending industry continued pushing the overhaul well into the new millennium, this time under an industry-friendly Republican president and with Biden still its loyal soldier. He would vote again and again with Republicans to advance the legislation while taking tens of thousands of dollars more from MBNA, which by this point was paying Hunter, who had left the company in 2001 to become a lobbyist, a monthly consulting fee.\n\n\"Simply put, too many people are finding it too easy to walk away from their legitimate obligations by filing for bankruptcy,\" Biden said, explaining his support for the bill. Warren, in a 2002 New York Times op-ed calling the legislation \"a quiet attack on women,\" charged that Biden had \"agreed to vote with Republicans on almost all the issues that were holding up the bill.\" The two would finally meet face to face three years later at a Judiciary Committee meeting, where Biden accused her of making a \"mildly demagogic argument\" and insisted her real problem was with interest rates, not bankruptcy.\n\n\"But if it's not going to fix that problem, you can't take away the last shred of protection for these families,\" Warren shot back. \"I got it, okay,\" Biden replied, chuckling. \"You're very good, professor.\"\n\nBiden and the lending industry won; he and seventeen other Democrats voted with yet another lockstep Republican majority for the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law on April 20, 2005. It was another disaster for the American working class: even as households remained buried under mountains of debt, fewer filed for bankruptcy, deterred by the bureaucratic hoops and higher costs ushered in by the law. Credit card fees, interest rates, and prices, all of which the bill's proponents swore would drop once the law went into action, kept on climbing, bringing record profits to the industry on the order of many billions more a year. The law swiftly came to be hated by a cross-section of bankruptcy judges, furious at having to dismiss cases where the filers didn't know they were required to take credit counseling classes first. \"Unquestionably, this is the most poorly written piece of legislation that I or anyone else has ever seen,\" said one. Another accused Congress in a written opinion of working with the credit industry \"to make more money off the backs of consumers in this country.\" Of course, all of this affected Hispanic and black families the most; they were two and three times more likely to file for bankruptcy as white families, respectively.\n\nAll this had happened in no small part through Biden's efforts. \"He provided cover to other Democrats to do what the credit industry was urging them to do,\" Travis Plunkett, legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America, would later recall, saying Biden had provided a \"veneer of bipartisanship\" that helped the industry sway other Democrats. Warren remembered it similarly. \"The Senate was evenly split between the two parties, but one of the bill's lead sponsors was Democratic powerhouse Joe Biden, and right behind him were plenty of other Democrats offering to help,\" she charged in 2014.\n\nThis was a pattern with Biden. At various times, he voted against a measure banning double charging for ATM transactions, an amendment strengthening protections for bankrupt Americans who had large medical debts or served in the military, a provision to shift responsibility from debtors to the predatory lenders who had drove them into bankruptcy, and a requirement that credit card companies warn consumers of the consequences of making only minimum payments. It is little wonder that Warren, coming off her own political conversion from being a Republican, would view Biden as everything wrong with the Democratic Party.\n\nBut even all this paled in significance compared to a virtually ignored vote Biden cast at the close of the 1990s. After Citigroup was formed in 1998 out of a merger that was, strictly speaking, illegal, Robert Rubin - Clinton's former Treasury secretary who, unbeknownst to anyone, was in talks for an executive position at the new bank - worked his influence in concert with Citi lobbyists and Clinton's banker-friendly advisers to retroactively legalize its creation. They did so through a bill repealing the Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era law separating commercial and investment banking passed to prevent another epochal crash. Voting against it in the House, Bernie Sanders warned it would lead to \"more mega-mergers\" and the \"further concentration of economic power in this country.\" Biden, once more with a unanimous GOP and a large contingent of Democrats behind him, voted to make it law.\n\n\"'I think we will look back in ten years' time and say we should not have done this but we did because we forgot the lessons of the past,\" Sen. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota said after the vote. \"That which is true in the 1930s is true in 2010.\"\n\nJust as in the 1980s, there was one aspect of the federal government and its purse strings where Biden's budget-cutting obsession not only didn't apply but went in the opposite direction: crime and drugs.\n\nThe end of that decade set the pattern for what followed. In September 1989, President Bush had delivered a speech outlining his National Drug Control Strategy, calling for harsher punishments for drug dealers, nearly $1.5 billion toward drug-related law enforcement, and \"more prisons, more jails, more courts, more prosecutors\" at every level throughout the country. At the time, the right-wing Heritage Foundation gushed that this constituted \"the largest increase in resources for law enforcement in the nation's history.\" Decades on, it's remembered as a key moment in the escalation of the \"war on drugs,\" with Bush putting forward an expansive bill based on the strategy the following year.\n\nBut for Biden, it was a half-measure. \"Quite frankly, the President's plan is not tough enough, bold enough, or imaginative enough to meet the crisis at hand,\" Biden said in a televised response to Bush's speech. \"In a nutshell, the President's plan does not include enough police officers to catch the violent thugs, enough prosecutors to convict them, enough judges to sentence them, or enough prison cells to put them away for a long time.\"\n\nJust as Biden spent the 1980s chiding Reagan for being insufficiently pitiless on crime, he would spend the 1990s leading the Democratic Party in an ongoing contest of one-upmanship against the GOP on the issue. The stakes were high. Bush had won the presidency in 1988 by successfully tarring Michael Dukakis, his centrist Democratic opponent, as a wimpy liberal who put law-abiding Americans in harm's way by being too soft on criminals. Neither Biden nor the rest of the party would let themselves be outflanked on the issue again.\n\nPartisan wrangling over tough-on-crime legislation occupied most of Biden's time and energy for the first half of the 1990s. Biden and the Democrats tried again and again to pass a major, extreme new crime bill, eager to prove to the voting public they could be just as harsh and unforgiving to criminals as the GOP, if not more so. In 1991, Biden boasted that his much bigger version of the crime bill included the death penalty for no less than fifty-one offenses - five more than Bush's bill. \"What do we have to do, put half the country behind bars?\" Bernie Sanders said on the House floor.\n\n\"A wag in the newspaper recently wrote something to the effect that Biden has made it a death penalty offense for everything expect jaywalking,\" Biden joked.\n\nThese efforts were roundly criticized at the time. The NAACP and other groups lobbied against the bill. In a letter addressed to senators just a few days before the vote, three ACLU lawyers called the legislation \"far worse from a civil liberties perspective than any that has ever been considered by the Senate.\" Lawyers and federal judges - including the latter's official policy-making body - warned the law would overwhelm the judicial system and widen its already broad inequality. As the different versions made their way to Bush's desk, the Washington Post condemned them as \"rotten\" and an exercise \"not so much to combat crime as to convince the public that legislators are tough on criminals.\"\n\nOccasionally Biden would oppose a particularly extreme Republican measure, though in typical style, only after accepting the premise and watering it down somewhat. So when Republicans tried to get rid of the exclusionary rule - that is, allow the use of illegally seized evidence in court as long as it was illegally seized by authorities in \"good faith\" - Biden argued forcefully against it on the floor, then put forward a proposal that allowed the use of evidence seized in \"good faith\" under an improper search warrant. Civil liberties advocates looked on in horror as dubious measure after dubious measure made its way into the bill, while one embarrassed Democratic senator shook his head at the \"crass political contest\" over who \"hated crime the most.\" \"No one will deny this is an extremely tough bill,\" Biden said.\n\nThe legislation failed, but only because of the GOP. Its gun control provisions inspired pushback from the National Rifle Association, and Republican senators subsequently blocked it. When that didn't stick, Bush, afraid of handing the Democrats a win on one of his key issues so close to an election, vetoed it, claiming it was too soft. The process would repeat itself again the following year, when Republicans filibustered that edition because the severe limits it placed on habeas corpus, or prisoners' right to appeal, weren't severe enough . \"I just can't believe Republicans would kill a death penalty bill,\" said Biden.\n\nBy 1993, however, things had changed. Bush had been replaced by Clinton, who, facing down a surprisingly ferocious right-wing campaign, had every reason to make his party look tough on crime. Whispering in his ear was adviser Rahm Emanuel, a right-wing fundraiser who assured Clinton it would poll well. Whispering in his other ear was Biden, who privately urged the president to \"seize control of the issue by upping the ante\" and demanded \"rapid enactment of the Biden/Clinton\" crime bill to \"maintain crime as a Democratic initiative.\"\n\nWhile Clinton gave the effort his full backing, Biden put his famous skills at Senate wheeling and dealing toward passing what was essentially a conservative Republican bill. On television, Biden offered Texas Republican senator Phil Gramm a deal: if Gramm dropped his opposition to the bill's gun control measures, Biden would support Gramm's mandatory minimum sentences, which at least one newspaper described as \"vague\" and \"almost uniformly bad.\" This was despite saying that same year: \"I think we've had all the mandatory minimums that we need. We don't need the ones that we had.\"\n\nIn went Trent Lott's amendment setting up a \"three strikes\" provision for violent felonies, something Biden had called a \"wacko amendment\" one year earlier but now voted for despite laying out his concerns about it at length. Same with an amendment to make carjacking a federal offense, potentially punishable by death. Even the extreme things Biden voted against, like prosecuting kids as young as thirteen as adults, didn't dampen his enthusiasm to get the bill passed.\n\n\"There is a mood here that if someone came to the floor and said we should barb-wire the ankles of anyone who jaywalks, I suspect it would pass,\" he said in November 1993. \"I think we've gone overboard already.\"\n\nAs he explained on the Senate floor, he was fine with what he called \"barbed-wire amendments\" because while \"they make sense and they are useful,\" they also didn't \"mean anything of consequence.\" The real meat of the bill, he said, was the extra $21 billion being pumped into law enforcement, funded by almost the exact amount of savings ($22 billion) Biden and the rest of Congress had made by approving Clinton's earlier slashing of the federal workforce. \"We are trading, in effect, in this bill, bureaucrats for cops,\" he explained.\n\nThis was far from an outlier in the Clinton years, when the money cut from public housing and welfare budgets was diverted instead toward building the carceral state. As sociologist Loïc Wacquant pointed out, slicing $17 billion from public housing while lifting prison funding by $19 billion in these years effectively made \"the construction of prisons the nation's main housing program for the urban poor.\"\n\nOn August 25, the bill cleared the Senate for the final time. \"Biden's relief was obvious,\" went one account of the vote. \"He gave a thumbs-up sign to a reporter in the press gallery. He chatted with his Democratic colleagues. He stayed unusually quiet in the floor debate. And he smiled. Often.\" Dianne Feinstein kissed him on the floor. Maine senator George Mitchell declared him \"the one person most responsible for passage of this bill\" and \"the most effective legislator in the Senate, bar none.\" \"I hope my mom was listening,\" Biden replied.\n\nThe bill whose passage Biden and the rest of the Democrats were celebrating like it was V-E Day wasn't necessarily viewed so favorably outside of Washington. Around the country, newspapers deemed the congressional bidding war that produced it a creation of \"hysteria,\" pointing out, for example, that mandatory minimums, which had helped to triple the prison population in fourteen years, were disastrous. Even in Washington the feeling wasn't unanimous, with the Congressional Black Caucus voicing wide-ranging objections. Biden's own words on the Senate floor described the skepticism: that Congress was simply trying \"to show everybody how tough we are.\"\n\nIndeed, just as in the previous decade, Biden had actively cultivated this hysteria even while crime had in fact sharply dropped since a decade earlier. When the Justice Department released a 1991 report showing a decrease since the previous year, Biden called it flawed and urged no one to believe \"the epidemic of crime in America has been broken.\" That same year, he claimed that rural America was \"suffering a plague of violent crime, drug trafficking and drug abuse,\" even as the per capita rural crime rate was dwarfed by its urban counterpart. He charged that the whole country had just \"undergone the worst crime epidemic in its entire history\" and that \"demographics\" - namely, a \"growth in violent teenaged gangs\" - had led to this \"record carnage.\" As he steered the bill toward passage, he assured audiences that \"the victimization of America is greater than the statistics suggest,\" and that FBI figures showing a fall in crime over 1992 were \"misleading.\"\n\nBut as Biden's private and public rhetoric made clear - and as was widely understood at the time - the legislation had always been about securing political cover. As Biden put it on the Senate floor:\n\nThe liberal wing of the Democratic Party is now for 60 new death penalties....The liberal wing of the Democratic Party has 70 enhanced penalties....The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 100,000 cops. The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 125,000 new state prison cells....I would like to see the conservative wing of the Democratic Party.\n\n\"I hope the president would maybe take the politics of crime out of the upcoming elections,\" Biden had said after an earlier version passed under Bush. When the bill finally became law in 1994, he made it the centerpiece of his 1996 reelection campaign, touting it and his support for the balanced budget amendment to the New Castle County Chamber of Commerce, which gave him a standing ovation. When neoconservative commentator Bill Kristol told the GOP leadership to keep attacking Democrats on the crime bill, Biden responded: \"I would like to be running and have someone 'use the crime bill' against me.\" \"I hope to God that Bush attacks us on crime,\" he said on the eve of the 2000 election. \"I think we would eat them alive.\"\n\nClinton signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act into law on a sunny fall day in September, as Biden proudly looked on and a large, bipartisan crowd of officials applauded. By the time Clinton left office, the United States had the world's highest incarceration rate, and two decades after the bill passed, the federal prison population had more than doubled. Even the bill's few laudable measures like the Violence Against Women Act, which Biden had pushed for intensely and which motivated even critics like Sanders to vote for it, further fed incarceration rates while doing little to bring down domestic violence - and even exacerbated it in some cases.\n\nIt is little surprise that prominent figures involved in the law's passage would come to regret their roles, including the Clintons and Sanders, who later admitted he was \"not happy I voted for a terrible bill.\" Not Biden, though. For more than a decade afterward, he touted what he called the \"Biden crime law\" as one of his proudest accomplishments, claiming as late as 2016 it had \"restored American cities.\" Perhaps he had a point: evidence suggests that by locking more people away and taking them from the labor pool, mass incarceration artificially depressed official unemployment numbers, letting Clinton and his neoliberal policies take credit for a supposed economic miracle.\n\nBut the 1994 law was not the end of Biden's overzealous crime-fighting efforts. For the second half of the decade, he turned his attention to \"juvenile delinquents.\"\n\nWarning of a \"youth arms race,\" he sponsored a bill in 1996 loosening the rules around imprisonment of minors, letting local jails keep juveniles locked up for three times as long in certain circumstances and relaxing the requirement that they be kept \"out of sight and sound\" of adult inmates. For the next three years, he worked with Republicans and Democrats to write and rewrite a massive juvenile crime bill, which at various times included provisions creating special juvenile \"gun\" courts, putting $1 billion toward jails for violent juveniles, and building on the 1994 crime bill by generally expanding the size and powers of law enforcement.\n\nWhat prompted and justified such severe measures was one criminologist's racist 1995 prediction that the country was on the brink of an outbreak of \"superpredators\": fearless, remorseless, violent youth criminals who didn't know right from wrong. The prediction seemed to be proven true by a spate of school shootings. The theory, which its author later retracted, would become infamous during the 2016 election, when a twenty-year-old video of Hillary Clinton, now the Democratic presidential nominee, espousing the idea ignited outrage. At the time, though, Biden echoed this language, charging that his 1996 bill would apply \"very forcefully to that category of children who are predators,\" whom he placed in a separate category from \"at-risk kids.\"\n\nBiden seemed to have a change of heart as deliberations wore on, saying the bill \"may be a cure worse than the disease\"; warning, uncharacteristically, that tougher sentencing may not actually fix anything; and calling one provision that let police and schools access juvenile offenders' records \"overkill.\" Yet he still cosponsored the 1999 iteration of the bill, which had this and many other troubling elements in it, including the central provision undergirding all these efforts: making it easier for prosecutors to try kids as young as fourteen as adults and applying harsh mandatory minimums to them in the process. Despite years of work and progress, and perhaps to Biden's relief, the bill never made it out of Congress.\n\nNonetheless, this impulse stretched on into the new millennium, when Biden turned his attention to a drug mostly consumed by middle-class white kids: ecstasy. Declaring that \"most raves are havens for illicit drug use,\" he introduced a 2002 law that held concert promoters responsible for any drug use at events and treated objects like water bottles and glow sticks as drug paraphernalia. To get the bill passed, Biden reintroduced it numerous times, including once by slipping it into an unrelated bill creating the Amber Alert system.\n\n\"All the things I had fought for were under siege,\" Biden had said in 1996, explaining his decision to run for a fifth term. And he was right. What he left out was that they were in large part under siege by him.\n\nThough at its close many looked fondly back on the decade as one of prosperity and plenty, the 1990s were in fact a disaster for the American working class. Building on the political sea change and economic pain first wrought by Reagan, those ten years saw jobs offshored, government shrunk, hard-won state programs debilitated, and huge numbers of mostly poor and nonwhite people thrown into prison, usually for behavior born out of social and economic circumstances they had little control over. And Biden and an increasingly right-wing Democratic Party bore much of the responsibility.\n\n\"It's the middle class, stupid. It's the middle class,\" Biden said as he fought for that fifth term. \"They are the beginning, the middle and the end of the political viability of this government.\" Yet the freedom to finally pursue a neoliberal agenda - whether by passing NAFTA, slashing spending, shrinking the federal workforce, or making bankruptcy harder for ordinary Americans - ironically led Biden to hollow out that same precious middle class in the long term, a blow that would come back around frighteningly decades later.\n\nAnd yet Biden looked back on those eight years with satisfaction. \"Clinton got it right,\" he said in 2001 when a journalist asked him whether Democrats should run on a populist message or if that risked alienating suburban voters. He went on:\n\nI was one of those guys in 1987 who tried to run on a platform that Clinton basically ran on in 1992. And that is, for a lack of a better phrase, his \"Third Way.\" It worked. It's where the American people are. It's where the Democratic Party should have been....One of the things I'm most angry about in the [aftermath of the] 2000 election, we're now renegotiating as a party what the hell our message should be and who we are, when for me it was settled in 1992.\n\nIn reality, by the time Biden said these words, centrism had been an electoral failure. Besides Clinton, centrist Democrats who ran away from the New Deal were largely a political failure; presidential candidates cut from this cloth had lost spectacularly throughout the 1980s, closely in 2000, and twice more in pivotal elections after that. It was part of the reason an ever-louder chorus of voices would demand that the party return to the economically populist roots Roosevelt had charted during the New Deal, voices that would be mostly shut out and ignored for another fourteen years.\n\n\"First off, they're wrong substantively,\" Biden told his interviewer in 2001. \"But secondly, it's not the way we win elections....So the idea now, and it's credible, is that class warfare and populism is the way we should conduct the next election. We do that [and] George Bush will be a second-term President, regardless of how bad a job he may do.\"\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

And they would've gotten away with it, too, if their progressive colleagues hadn't stepped in and stopped them.\n\nFresh off the legislative victory netted from a bill boosting semiconductor production , conservative Democrats sought to pass a package of measures that included an assault weapons ban - as well as a bunch of goodies for police departments.\n\nHere's how The New Republic broke it down :\n\n\"One bill, co-sponsored by Representative Abigail Spanberger, would have provided additional grant funding to hire officers, while another, sponsored by Representative Josh Gottheimer, would have provided assistance for police departments with fewer than 200 officers. Both bills had bipartisan support. But progressive Democrats and members of the Congressional Black Caucus raised concerns about providing funding for police without any accountability measures in place, particularly since no police reform legislation has passed since the racial justice protests that swept the nation in the summer of 2020.\"\n\nMorally and politically speaking, sensible Democrats in Congress' Black and progressive caucuses were right to put the kibosh on this plan. If conservative Democrats like Spanberger and Gottheimer want to send a message that they're unquestionably in police officers' corner, they need to send that message in a way less likely to have horrible downstream effects on Americans - especially Black Americans. There are mountains of evidence showing that the 1994 crime bill, which allocated billions of dollars in federal funding to police departments and prisons, worsened mass incarceration and precipitated many of the overly aggressive policing tactics we see today.\n\nIt stigmatized communities. It broke families apart. It bloated the police state.\n\nAnd Biden's sponsorship of the bill was a major headwind in the 2020 presidential campaign that many people believe prevented him from getting more support from some young voters , particularly young Black people. Another Biden crime bill wouldn't help. It's remarkable that Democrats even considered it, if for no other reason than it shows that some of them were willing to tempt that fate again at a time when their majority in the House is so tenuous. Thankfully, leveler heads - meaning, progressives - prevailed.\n\nRelated:\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger. He previously wrote The ReidOut Blog.

      "text": "Analysis: The complex history of the controversial 1994 crime bill\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders take the stage Thursday night in Brooklyn, the debate moderators will almost certainly ask them about a 22-year-old crime law. The issue is back in the news after the 1994 crime bill came up at a Hillary Clinton campaign rally last week.\n\nSince then, much has been said about the legislation's effect on crime and mass incarceration. Some argue the measure, officially called the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, led to a drop in crime. Others vehemently contend it did not. Questions abound about its impact on mass incarceration.\n\nWith millions watching Thursday, the candidates can help put the bill in context - and offer their specific ideas to move criminal justice policy forward.\n\nLike most political compromises, the crime bill did some good and some bad. It contributed to both the crime decline and mass incarceration. But not in the way that people might think.\n\nRELATED: Unexpected issue takes center stage in Democratic race\n\nFirst, the good: Though the crime bill was not responsible for the entire drop in crime, it likely helped - not by locking people up, but by putting more cops on the street, studies show. It provided funding for 100,000 new police officers and $14 billion in grants for community-oriented policing, for example. From 1990 to 1999, the number of police officers rose 28 percent, from 699,000 to 899,000, partly funded by the crime bill.\n\nResearch also indicates smarter policing tactics, like the ones funded by the bill, and social and economic factors - like an aging population and decreased alcohol consumption - played a role in the crime decline as well.\n\nCrime had already started declining before the bill passed. From 1991 to 1994, crime dropped 10 percent and violence decreased by 5 percent. From 1994 to 2000, crime fell an additional 23 percent, with violent crime dropping by almost 30 percent. All of the above contributed to the fall.\n\nThen there's the bad: Although incarceration was already rising steadily before the crime bill, several of its provisions helped increase incarceration even further. Nevertheless, this increase had little impact on America's subsequent drop in crime.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1994, the rate of imprisonment exploded 400 percent, to 387 per 100,000 people. From 1994 to 2009, imprisonment continued to rise, doubling.\n\nThe crime bill contributed to this increase in incarceration. First, it banned 19 types of semiautomatic assault weapons, authorized the death penalty for dozens of existing and new federal crimes, and instituted a federal \"three strikes and you're out\" provision.\n\nBut those facets were far less pernicious than how the crime bill influenced states to increase their prison rolls. The bill granted states $12.5 billion to build prisons if they passed \"truth-in-sentencing\" (TIS) laws, which required inmates to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences.\n\nA 2002 Urban Institute study found that between 1995 and 1999, nine states adopted TIS laws for the first time, and another 21 states changed their TIS laws to comply with the crime bill's requirements and then apply for funding. By 1999, a total of 42 states had such laws on the books, sustaining an increase in imprisonment.\n\nThe crime bill, however, was just the most high-profile legislation to increase the number of people behind bars. On their own, states passed three-strikes laws, enacted mandatory minimums, eliminated parole, and removed judicial discretion in sentencing. By dangling bonus dollars, the crime bill encouraged states to remain on their tough-on-crime course.\n\nRELATED: Dems debate legacy of 1994 crime bill\n\nWhat's worse, research shows the dramatic increase in incarceration in the 1990s and 2000s played a limited role in bringing down crime. A classic case of \"diminishing returns,\" incarceration's effect on reducing crime had been declining since before 1980. Since 2000, the effect of incarceration on crime has been even more limited. When prisons are used sparingly, incarceration is reserved for the highest-risk and most-serious offenders. When prison populations grow to be too large, it is usually by incarcerating less serious offenders. In other words, the more people we put in prison, the less likely each additional inmate has on reducing crime.\n\nWith crime and punishment again in the national debate, hopefully Thursday night Sanders and Clinton will outline specific plans for reining in our system of mass incarceration, which imprisons more than 2.2 million Americans. Ted Cruz and John Kasich have also endorsed criminal justice reform in some way on the campaign trail, with even Donald Trump acknowledging possible areas for change.\n\nThere is a solution they can champion. Just like in the 1990s, the federal government can encourage states to continue their current trajectory. Between 2008 and 2013, 32 states reduced both imprisonment and crime. A federal \"Reverse Crime Bill\" can encourage states to go further.\n\nA modern crime bill can shift the flow of federal dollars by providing grants to states that reduce rates of both crime and imprisonment. Clinton, in an interview with the New York Daily News editorial board, recently acknowledged a role for Washington to set financial incentives for states to reduce imprisonment. She should expand on those points in Brooklyn Thursday.\n\nAs we debate these issues, it's important to remember the facts: Crime is at its lowest levels today. And mass incarceration is near its highest. The crime bill likely played a role in the crime decline, but it also certainly increased the number of Americans behind bars.\n\nThe next president can and should back legislation to reverse the bad while preserving the good.\n\nLauren-Brooke Eisen is senior counsel in the Justice Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law.

In January, D.C.'s majority-Black city council overruled Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser's veto of a bill overhauling the city's criminal code. The bill included measures that would eliminate most mandatory minimum sentences, reduce mandatory maximum penalties and allow for jury trials on misdemeanor charges.\n\nEarlier this week, I wrote about the Senate and House resolutions introduced to overturn the council's decision in a list of the conservative movement's most egregiously racist power grabs .\n\nBiden tweeted his support for the Senate version on Thursday:\n\nAs Nazgol Ghandnoosh, co-director of research for The Sentencing Project, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed last fall, the proposed changes in the code are needed to address years of ineffective, often racist, policing.\n\nBiden's agreement on overruling the will of a city council that was empowered by Washington, D.C. voters flies in the face of his self-proclaimed support for self-determination in the district - most notably, his support for D.C. statehood . It appears the president thinks Washingtonians, and the officials they elect, should be allowed to make their own choices - except when he says they shouldn't.\n\nRemember this the next time the White House inevitably touts its record with Black voters.\n\nIt's a completely incoherent and inexcusable stance from a man whose record on criminal justice is already rife with blemishes. During his time in the Senate, Biden famously sponsored the 1994 crime bill widely credited for contributing to mass incarceration - disproportionately, among Black people. This, you'll remember, was an issue then-candidates Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and others brought up during the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race . That crime bill was largely premised on a flawed belief Biden apparently still holds, given his tweet's reference to carjacking penalties: that more severe punishments and lower crime rates go hand-in-hand . Studies have debunked that theory .\n\nBiden's negative influence on yet another crime bill, and its potential to marginalize many of the people harmed by the first one, suggests he hasn't learned much since 1994.\n\nRemember this the next time the White House inevitably touts its record with Black voters. Politically, this move is self-injurious - for Biden, who is considering a run for re-election, and for the Democratic Party generally. Morally, it's straight-up shameful.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger. He previously wrote The ReidOut Blog. He is a futurist and multimedia producer focused on culture and politics.

Biden Jr. became the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1987, a few months ahead of his first and ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaign, he told aides his goal was to enact legislation that would take a comprehensive approach to reducing crime.\n\nAs the ranking minority member of the committee since 1981, Mr. Biden had helped pass two bills establishing mandatory minimums for drug offenses. But as chairman, facing high violent crime rates, a crack cocaine epidemic, and accusations by Republicans that his party was soft on crime, Mr. Biden wanted holistic reform.\n\nThe effort, which defined much of his time as committee chairman, culminated in the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, a sweeping, bipartisan bill that touched nearly every aspect of American law enforcement that was signed into law by President Bill Clinton .\n\nMore than two decades later, that legislation is once again the subject of fierce debate - this time, as a bipartisan coalition of activists and lawmakers seeks to undo the era of mass incarceration they say the 1994 crime bill helped create.\n\nThe rapid shift in mood that those efforts reflect - a reaction to falling crime rates and a renewed attention to issues of racial injustice - could prove one of many hurdles for Mr. Biden if he decides to become a candidate for president.\n\nAlready, in the 2016 presidential race, criminal justice has commanded a level of attention unseen since the 1990s and has compelled both Republicans and Democrats to have something new to say about it. For Mr. Biden to win support from the young voters who were critical to President Obama 's election victories, according to activists like Jeremy Haile, he will need to show his views have evolved.\n\nDonald J.

Biden Jr. makes his third run for the White House, he is being pressed to answer for his role in legislation that criminal justice experts say helped lay the groundwork for the mass incarceration that has devastated America's black communities.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, when Mr. Biden was a senator from Delaware, he and other leaders of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee helped fashion a string of bills that overhauled the country's crime laws.\n\nAmong the most significant were: the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, which established mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses; the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which imposed harsher sentences for possession of crack than for possession of powder cocaine; and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which was essentially a catchall tough-on-crime bill.\n\nMr. Biden long defended the 1994 crime bill, saying as recently as 2016 that it \"restored American cities\" and that he was not ashamed of it.\n\nHe apologized in January for portions of his anti-crime legislation, but he has largely tried to play down his involvement, saying in April that he \"got stuck with\" shepherding the bills because he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nHis campaign has maintained that Mr. Biden has \"fought to defeat systemic racism and unacceptable racial disparities for his entire career\" and that he \"believes that too many people of color are in jail in this country.\" Current statistics from the United States Bureau of Prisons show that African-Americans, who make up roughly 12 percent of the American population, account for 37.5 percent of the federal prison population.\n\nAnd on the trail, Mr. Biden has hinted that he intends to propose a criminal justice reform package that would include some measures that would directly repudiate provisions of the 1994 crime bill.\n\nThe crowded field of Democrats seeking the White House is filled with candidates calling for ambitious criminal justice reform .\n\nThe legacy of the 1994 crime bill is mixed. While some studies show that it did lower crime, there is also evidence that it contributed to the explosion of the prison population. Critics of that bill and other anti-crime legislation of the era say Mr. Biden now needs to explain what he will do next.\n\nMatt Stevens is an arts and culture reporter for The New York Times based in New York.

It offered incentives to states to build more prisons if they toughened sentences, and it added some mandatory minimum sentences to those that already existed. But it also promoted the expansion of community policing and drug courts as alternatives to jail. It established a federal \"three strikes\" law and expanded the federal death penalty, but outlawed assault rifles.\n\nSome critics portray the law as a critical turning point as the country rushed to put more low-level offenders in prison, ravaging low-income communities.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Weaver\n\nAS political candidates and pundits grapple with the legacy of the 1994 crime bill and the era of mass incarceration that has seen millions of African-Americans locked in the nation's prisons, one defense keeps popping up: that black citizens asked for it.\n\nWhen confronted about her husband's pivotal support for the bill, Hillary Clinton argued, even as she admitted the legislation's shortcomings, that the bill was a response to \"great demand, not just from America writ large, but from the black community, to get tougher on crime.\"\n\nYet the historical record reveals a different story. Instead of being the unintended consequence of the democratic process at work, punitive crime policy is a result of a process of selectively hearing black voices on the question of crime.\n\nThere's no question that by the early 1990s, blacks wanted an immediate response to the crime, violence and drug markets in their communities. But even at the time, many were asking for something different from the crime bill. Calls for tough sentencing and police protection were paired with calls for full employment, quality education and drug treatment, and criticism of police brutality.\n\nIt's not just that those demands were ignored completely. It's that some elements were elevated and others were diminished - what we call selective hearing. Policy makers pointed to black support for greater punishment and surveillance, without recognizing accompanying demands to redirect power and economic resources to low-income minority communities. When blacks ask for better policing, legislators tend to hear more instead.\n\nSelective hearing has a deep history. In the Progressive Era, W.E.B. DuBois and Ida B. Wells called for state authorities to offer blacks the same social investment that reformers used to manage crime in white immigrant communities. But while whites received rehabilitation and welfare programs, black citizens found themselves overpunished and underprotected.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Unlocking the Truth About the Clinton Crime Bill\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nOpinion\n\nBy David Yassky\n\nAT a campaign event in Philadelphia last week, former President Bill Clinton was interrupted by protesters incensed about his 1994 crime bill. Mr. Clinton did not hold back : \"Because of that bill we had a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in the murder rate, and because of that and the background-check law, we had a 46-year low in deaths of people by gun violence,\" he said.\n\nIt is undeniable that two decades of mass incarceration have inflicted grievous harm on African-American men and their families. And yet Mr. Clinton was right to defend his policies (and, by extension, Hillary Clinton's support for those policies at the time).\n\nAs counsel to the House Subcommittee on Crime led by Charles E. Schumer, then a representative, I spent 18 months helping to draft and negotiate the 1994 crime bill. Anyone who thinks the bill was just about locking people up is simply wrong.\n\nIf the battle over the 1994 bill was just campaign noise, we could shrug it off, but what's really at stake is the future of crime policy. If we are going to move forward thoughtfully - keeping our neighborhoods safe without consigning huge segments of the population to life behind bars - we must understand how we got here.\n\nIn 1993, the year President Clinton took office, violent crime struck nearly 11 million Americans , and an additional 32 million suffered thefts or burglaries. These staggering numbers put millions more in fear. They also choked the economic vitality out of entire neighborhoods.\n\nPolitically, crime had become one of the most divisive issues in the country. Republicans called for an ever more punitive \"war on drugs,\" while many Democrats offered little beyond nebulous calls to eliminate the \"root causes\" of crime.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

But it was not just Mr. Clinton who criticized the young protesters. Afterward, some older African-Americans did, too.\n\n\"I think it is crazy to protest the crime bill,\" said Caryl Brock, 53, a social worker from the Bronx, who scolded the protesters on social media. \"Should it be amended? Maybe. But a lot of people really wanted it. I really wanted it.\"\n\nYoung and energized African-Americans this election cycle are aggressively challenging longstanding ideas and policies, especially those carried out during the Clinton administration in areas like crime and welfare. But the activism is also laying bare a striking generation gap between younger and older African-Americans, whose experience, views of the former president and notions of how they should push for change diverge dramatically.\n\nThe parents and grandparents of today's young black protesters largely waged the battle for civil rights in courtrooms and churches. They carefully chose people who were viewed as upstanding citizens, like Rosa Parks, to be the face of their movement, and dressed in their Sunday best as they sought to gain broader acceptance. Mr. Clinton endeared himself to these generations by campaigning in black churches and appointing more blacks to the cabinet than any previous president had.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

One of these attacks is simply cynical. The other is dangerous.\n\nFor those whose memories of early 1990s America are either foggy or nonexistent, it's worth recalling what life in much of urban America was like back then. A sample:\n\n\"The death yesterday of a 41-year-old armed security guard from Long Island was not an uncommon occurrence in East New York,\" The Times reported on Dec. 20, 1993. \"Indeed, it followed 13 other killings in the 75th Precinct in the last nine days.\"\n\n\"What was uncommon about the killing,\" the report continued, \"was that it broke a 20-year record for homicides in a single precinct, although with a footnote. Maurice Matola, the victim, was by unofficial count the 124th person killed this year in the 75th Precinct. ... Last night, a shooting on Georgia Avenue made Anthony Broadnax, 17, the 125th person killed.\"\n\nFast-forward more than two decades to another story in The Times about the same neighborhood. \"Once the 'Killing Fields,' East New York Has No Murders in 2018,\" ran an April 2018 headline, noting that the neighborhood had experienced a 129-day stretch without homicides. Citywide, New York ended last year with just under 300 murders, down 85 percent from the 1,960 it suffered in 1993.\n\nPut those numbers in a different perspective: If the murder rate in New York had persisted at its 1993 level over the next 25 years, 49,000 people would have been killed. Instead, some 15,000 were. That's 34,000 New Yorkers spared. Nationwide, the equivalent figure exceeds 150,000. Those were the teenagers who did come home that night, the mom or dad or sibling who wasn't missed at dinner. It's one of the most impressive social achievements of the past 30 years.\n\nWhat did the 1994 crime bill have to do with it?\n\nThere's a topic for a long debate. The bill coincided with an economic boom, the cresting of the crack-cocaine wave and, according to one notorious theory , the unintended benefit of legalized abortion eliminating thousands of would-be criminals before they had a chance to be born.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Biden Jr. announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, he has been widely portrayed in polls and commentary as the front-runner.\n\nOn the stump, Mr. Biden has focused on President Trump's shortcomings in broad pronouncements about morality and character.

      "text": "The Biggest Myth About the 1994 Crime Bill Still Haunts Joe Biden. It Shouldn't.\n\nThis story was produced in partnership with the Garrison Project , an independent, nonpartisan organization addressing the crisis of mass incarceration and policing.\n\nThis year marks the 30 th birthday of one of the most notorious pieces of legislation from Bill Clinton's presidency: the 1994 Crime Bill . Although many of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act' s provisions expired in the early 2000s, the bill took on new life during the 2016 presidential primaries. Hillary Clinton's critics attacked her support of the bill , arguing that it, and by extension Clinton herself, was responsible for causing mass incarceration. In the 2020 Democratic primary, criminal justice reformers -and President Joe Biden's opponents- pounced , because as a senator he was the bill's primary sponsor.\n\nClaims that Biden was an architect of mass incarceration will likely be resurrected again this year as he runs for reelection. \"You cannot bring up President Biden without talking about the '86 mandatory minimum sentencing, the '88 crack laws and the '94 crime bill,\" radio personality Charlamagne Tha God, who interviewed Biden on his show The Breakfast Club in 2020, recently told the New York Times.\n\nBut these critics are wrong. There is no evidence that the Crime Bill contributed to mass incarceration in any meaningful way. And it is critically important to explain why. Blaming the Crime Bill for mass incarceration doesn't just get basic facts wrong; it arises from-and contributes to-a fundamental misunderstanding of the limited way the federal government impacts prison policy, of the intractable local politics that drive mass incarceration, and of the current efforts to roll it back.\n\nPointing out that the Crime Bill did not drive mass incarceration is not an exercise in pedantic fact- checking. It's an exercise in explaining-the-entire-system-incorrectly- checking. And, erroneous explanations for how we got here lead to ineffective policy proposals for how to go somewhere else. Misguided by the misplaced emphasis on the Crime Bill, reformers have laid out proposals to roll back mass incarceration that would both do very little and give too little attention to those that could do real good.\n\nThe Crime Bill isn't so much a law itself as a holding company for many federal laws . It included the Violence Against Women Act, the Jacob Wetterling Act (which would later morph into the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act), an act establishing the federal assault weapon ban, the act creating the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program, and dozens of other provisions, including cutting Pell grants for people in prison, shielding personal information of abortion providers in DMV databases, and authorizing funding for social programs like midnight basketball .\n\nWhen people say that the Crime Bill \"caused\" mass incarceration, what they are usually referring to, even if they are not aware of it, is the Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing (VOI/TIS) grant program. The VOI/TIS program established a $10 billion pool of grant money available from 1995 to 2001 to states that adopted policies that kept people convicted of violent crimes in prison longer. The more specific funding part required states to adopt \"truth in sentencing\" laws which held that people convicted of violent offenses had to serve at least 85 percent of their sentence before they would be parole-eligible.\n\nIt's easy to see why people imagine that this provision helped drive mass incarceration: Billions of dollars became available to states, but only if they forced people to stay in prison longer. It's a simple and compelling account of mass incarceration. It's also incorrect.\n\nTo start, the timing is off. The VOI/TIS grants did not start until 1996 , and prison populations had been growing since 1972. Between 1972 and 1994 , the U.S. prison population grew from 200,000 people to just a little over 1 million. From 1995 to 2001, when the VOI/TIS grants expired, it grew by less than 300,000; the prison population grew by another 200,000 by the time it peaked in 2009. In other words, about 60 percent of the growth in U.S. prisons between 1972 and 2009 took place before the VOI/TIS program.\n\nBut even that analysis oversells the impact of VOI/TIS. To start, a 1998 evaluation by the U.S. Government Accountability Office found that in 1997, only 27 states received VOI/TIS funding.  Of the 27 states, 12 said the grants had no impact on their decision to adopt qualifying truth-in-sentencing laws (most had adopted them before 1994), and 11 said the grants only played a partial role in passing TIS laws since most had been considering them before 1994. A post-program follow-up found that states only claimed $3 billion of the $10 billion offered by the bill. Meaning: They left 70 percent of the money on the table.\n\nNot that it was that much money anyway! Ten billion dollars sounds like a lot of money. But that was over six years, and possibly across 50 states, at a time when states were spending tens of billions per year on incarceration. All told, the grants from the Crime Bill amounted to about 2 to 3 percent of correctional spending.\n\nYet even this overstates the importance of the VOI/TIS grants. Over the duration of the program, state prison populations grew, but at an increasingly slower rate. As crime declined, the machinery of mass incarceration slowed down. A similar dynamic has played out in New York over the past 25 years: As crime declined, the number of incarcerated people decreased by 54.7 percent from 1999 to 2024.\n\nRemarkably, during 2001, the last year of VOI/TIS, state prison populations actually fell (from 1.249 million to 1.247 million ), although an increase in federal prison populations led to a net national increase. State prison populations rebounded in 2002, but likely for reasons that had little to nothing to do with the Crime Bill and far more to do with the fear-based politics in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks . Furthermore, if one compares states that qualified for the VOI/TIS grants to those that did not, there is almost no noticeable difference in prison growth rates.\n\nIt's also important to note that other provisions of the Crime Bill, like the increased funding for hiring more police officers under COPS, and its push for community-oriented policing, did not contribute to mass incarceration. The explanation is simple: Despite the increase in police officer staffing over 1994 to 2001 thanks in part to COPS, total arrests fell by more than 10 percent, from 13.5 million to just under 12 million during the same period. So, fewer people entered the system, even as the number of police officers rose.\n\nYet in 2019, this abiding belief that the Crime Bill in general, and the VOI/TIS grants in particular, caused mass incarceration led several Democratic representatives and senators to introduce a bill titled \" The Reverse Mass Incarceration Act .\" The legislation sought to create a decarceral version of the Crime Bill: It would offer roughly the same amount of money, updated for inflation, to states that cut their prison populations. Putting aside the fact that the bill had no chance of passing during the Trump era, its underlying premise was fatally flawed. If states refused federal money in the 1990s to do what was politically easy , why should we expect a similarly small-sized grant program aimed at doing what is politically hard to succeed? There were deeper problems with the proposal, such as the fact that the costs of decarceration fall on rural communities that house prisons while the grants were aimed at urban communities, creating a politically difficult disconnect between costs and benefits.\n\nBut if the only problems with the Crime Bill narrative were a few Democratic senators drawing up a doomed bill at a time when they were out of power, or that some people got mad at Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden for the wrong reasons, then there might not be much reason to complain about it. But there are two much more consequential costs to this bad narrative.\n\nFirst, it makes us overlook how the feds can move the needle when it comes to mass incarceration. It's not through the executive or legislative side, but the judicial.\n\nMalcolm Feeley, one of the most preeminent scholars of prisons and mass incarceration, said that, in many albeit complex ways, \"litigation has probably been the single most important source of change in prisons and jails during the past 40 years.\" Federal courts imposed population caps, consent decrees, and other interventions that significantly mitigated the cruelest and most inhumane aspects of our prison system. The judiciary got its wings clipped under Clinton too, but in that was in 1995, thanks to a bill Biden did not sponsor (although he somewhat supported) called the Prison Litigation Reform Act .\n\nThe Crime Bill provides an account easy to grasp and get excited about: Congress threw billions of dollars at the states, and the states greedily threw thousands of people in prison to get it! The PLRA does not do that. It's all about \"standing\" to sue about prison conditions in federal court, about the \"exhaustion\" of \"state remedies,\" and about the durability of consent decrees. These are topics that are very hard to get ordinary people excited about. But they matter. A lot.\n\nThe essence of the PLRA is that it makes it hard for people in prison to sue over the conditions in which they are held, which makes it a lot easier for states to cram more and more people into preexisting facilities instead of incurring the steep capital costs of building new prisons. California provides a striking lesson on how this plays out.\n\nIn 2009, a 20-year-long legal battle over conditions in California's overcrowded prisons culminated in the 9 th Circuit Court of Appeals ordering the state to reduce its prison population from 200 percent of its rated capacity to 137.5 percent. The agency that the 9 th Circuit put in charge of managing health care in California's prisons admitted that overcrowding was likely causing about 60 preventable deaths a year-more than the total number of people executed in death penalty cases across all 50 states in most of the years between 1990 and 2009. In 2010, California appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court and lost, 5-4, in 2011's Brown v. Plata decision . But the four dissenters-Scalia and Alito among them-held that despite the clear, fatal costs of overcrowding, the lawsuit should have been dismissed under the PLRA.\n\nUnable to escape the lawsuit, California responded later in 2011 by adopting a policy called \" Realignment ,\" one of the most sweeping pieces of prison reform legislation adopted in U.S. history. Since then, essentially one-third of the national decline in state prison populations has been due to the reduction just in California . Criminologists and others have discussed how U.S. prison populations started to decline in 2010-but it really was a decline in the California prison population, with several other states making small downward adjustments.\n\nBut California only adopted Realignment because it was narrowly unable to shield itself from litigation via the PLRA, and conditions in the state's prisons were among the worst nationwide. Which means that the PLRA likely shields other states from legitimate litigation that would lead them to cut their prison populations. Note, too, that California adopted Realignment grudgingly despite the Democrats having near supermajorities in both chambers of the Legislature. Which means that any sort of Realignment-like reform surely faces tougher political resistance too, on top of the barriers erected by the PLRA.\n\nYet there has been little to no effort to repeal or amend the PLRA. Perhaps it would be a futile gesture given the filibuster and other anti-majoritarian impediments. But in 2005, Democrats like Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton attempted to repeal yet another harsh Clinton-era tough-on-crime law, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, despite a Republican president and a Republican majority in the Senate. Inaction on the PLRA is not inevitable.\n\nSo, the focus on the fairly-dormant but easy-to-understand Crime Bill comes with a real cost: largely ignoring the technocratic and legalistic law that still holds real consequence-the PLRA.\n\nThe second harm that comes from focusing on the Crime Bill is that it displaces the real source of mass incarceration, away from a very local \"us\" and onto a more distant federal \"them.\" The only way that the Crime Bill could have caused mass incarceration is if the states would not have locked up more people but for the federal money. It's a story of a clear, single villain-which points to a clear, single institution to target.\n\nBut that is not the story of mass incarceration. Mass incarceration did not come about from a series of federal top-down decrees. We ended up with the world's largest prison population because thousands of local actors like sheriffs and district attorneys, supported by millions of voters from both parties and across all demographic groups, wanted it. Or at least they wanted something like it, even if they disagreed about the goals and designs. As James Forman and Michael Fortner have shown, tough-on-crime arrest and sentencing policies often had support from local Black leaders and communities-sometimes they even led the charge. Mass incarceration was not driven by federal funding, but came about from the orders given to local police by locally elected mayors, to the people elected as county prosecutors, to the state laws passed by locally elected state legislators. All elections and policy choices over which the feds had little to no say.\n\nThe feds did not even play a leadership role. It's worth noting that the two major sentencing policies the Crime Bill pushed for-a federal three-strikes law and state truth-in-sentencing laws-were both laws that several states had adopted years earlier. The Crime Bill was reactive, not proactive. So it's not even possible to argue that the Crime Bill's real impact was more through persuasion or suggestion than through its meager financial incentives.\n\nOur current sprawling archipelago of prisons, of harsh post-release restrictions, parole limitations , wide-spread arrests , overcrowded , deadly jails , inadequate prison training and health care : All of these are local decisions requiring local efforts to reverse. This, of course, poses a policy challenge. We cannot target one identifiable, high-profile, highly salient actor-the federal government-to pass a big, dramatic bill to roll any or all of this back.\n\nSuccesses have come from the people canvassing for local elections, protesting in front of city halls, and speaking up at public meetings. So, the work of rolling back mass incarceration has to be done in statehouses, down-ballot county elections, and local city budget hearings. Which requires a lot of people, unglamorous work in municipal office buildings, and often an inability to simply write a donation to a major national advocacy organization and hope they can lobby the right set of legislators in D.C.\n\nMass incarceration is a national phenomenon, but a local story. No federal villain got us here, and no federal hero will be able to sweep in to save us. And to the extent there is a federal office that can police the most extreme edges of abuse in our system, it's not Congress and its easy-to-vilify power to throw cash around, but the federal courts and their arcane doctrines limiting who can sue and how. These causes of mass incarceration are harder, more labor-intensive, sometimes more technocratic to fix, and they force us to confront our own roles in how we got here. But they are the causes, not the Crime Bill.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Both essays focused in part on the 1994 crime bill that Clinton championed during the first term of her husband's presidency-a bill that expanded the use of the death penalty, created new three-strikes rules, and offered funding for states that made it harder for people to get parole. In Murch's words, \"Bill Clinton and his allies embarked on a draconian punishment campaign to outflank the Republicans,\" while Hillary supported the effort and \"stood resolutely at her husband's side.\" Alexander, the author of the influential book The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness , argued that Clinton's past embrace of tough-on-crime policies is one of several reasons black voters shouldn't support her.\n\nFor Michael Fortner, a professor of urban studies at the City University of New York and the author of the 2015 book Black Silent Majority , the two essays are emblematic of a tendency on the left to gloss over an important fact about the 1994 crime bill. Like many tough-on-crime policies that have been passed in the U.S. since the late 1960s, Fortner argues, the law enjoyed the support of many black activists and political leaders, who saw it as an imperfect but necessary measure to combat pervasive violence in poor black urban neighborhoods.\n\nThat doesn't mean there wasn't ample debate about whether Clinton's law was too punitive and whether it would actually be effective at reducing crime. But Fortner's argument-which he also makes in his book in reference to the infamously harsh drug laws passed by Nelson Rockefeller in 1973-is that crime policy should not be seen as something that just happens to minority populations. \"Black folks have agency,\" as he put it to me. \"Their voices had a huge impact in changing the narrative around urban crime and drug addition and pushing it in a way that validated very punitive crime policies.\"\n\nI spoke to Fortner about the complex politics behind the '94 bill and why the coalition of black leaders who supported the Clintons in passing it should not be forgotten. Our conversation has been edited and condensed.\n\nI recently heard you say that undoing the disaster of mass incarceration requires a serious reckoning with the problem that triggered it: crime. What did you think of how these two essays handled that issue?\n\nIf you read these two pieces, you'd get the sense that crime policy was not developed to solve any problem, that these laws were created just to put away black folks. In many ways, I started my journey in this literature because I thought the dominant scholars were completely ignoring the effects of crime on people's lives. I grew up in Brownsville [a high-crime neighborhood in Brooklyn], and I remember what crime felt like. And these academic discussions, these ideological discussions about crime, completely ignore the terror in the streets. They completely ignore how crime shaped whether you went to church at night or how you felt coming home from work.\n\nOnce you add that to the picture, I think crime policy becomes less suspicious. That doesn't mean it becomes less problematic. These were dumb policies. But they begin to have a logic that is not strictly tied to racial or economic imperatives. It begins to have a logic that's tied to people wanting to live normal, safe lives in urban communities, and politicians who responded to those pleas for greater public safety in ways that also lined up with their own political interests.\n\n﻿How bad was crime in America when Clinton became president?\n\nWhen he came to power there was a sense that crime had reached insane levels. People in urban communities were afraid to go out. By this point a lot of middle-class African Americans who were able to leave these neighborhoods had left, so you had a lack of civic organization, the housing stock was miserable, and there was just sort of a lot of despair and fear. And the crack epidemic was coming to a head at that point. You had gang violence over the drug trade. It was just a desperate situation for many urban African Americans.\n\nIn her essay, Alexander argues that Bill Clinton embraced crime as an issue because it helped him win the votes of white people who were straying from the Democratic Party. What do you make of that argument?\n\nI think Alexander is right when it comes to this point: Clinton was shaped by the changing dynamics of party politics in the late '80s and early '90s. And it is true that Clinton and other Democrats were concerned about working-class whites who were leaving the Democratic Party, and they wanted to develop messages that would appeal to them. \"Tough on crime\" was one of those messages. So, it is true that Clinton pursued this in order to achieve those political objectives. But it's also true that he wanted to solve a real problem-one that disproportionately affected minority communities.\n\nIn hindsight, the law can be seen as a continuation of policies that, decades earlier, started the U.S. down the path of mass incarceration. To what extent did black political leaders see it that way at the time?\n\nWell, in 1973, in New York, many black activists pushed for drug laws, and in the '80s many black activists pushed for punitive crime policies and supported aspects of Ronald Reagan's war on drugs. When Reagan signed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 into law, the one that created the crack-cocaine disparity, Charlie Rangel was onstage with him. And at the time they pushed this because they thought previous policies were not doing the job and that they needed to get tougher on the drug problem in urban communities. And as the drug problem worsened, many of them continued to push for more punitive policies and more aggressive policing.\n\nWhy?\n\nI think they saw these things as inadequate but necessary solutions to very urgent problems. And I think they did not foresee the unintended consequences of those policies. ... They thought they would stop the violence. And they thought they needed some type of mechanism to create safe streets for people who were not committing crimes, who needed to go to work, who needed to take their kids to school. And this speaks to the urgency of the situation-yes, they realized there was a host of other structural issues going on and they wanted remedies for those things, but they also felt like life in the inner city was just untenable. People were unable to live normal lives.\n\nCan you say more about the coalition of black activists and leaders who supported the '94 crime bill? Who were they?\n\nThere were different levels. On one level, there was grassroots mobilization of the community, particularly by black pastors. There was a group of influential black pastors who signed a letter encouraging the Congressional Black Caucus to support the bill. And then later, on top of that, black elected officials, who portrayed themselves at various points as uncomfortable with some of these laws, went along anyway because of pressure coming from their communities, and because they also realized the problem was so bad. And sometimes their support or opposition was really related to party politics, whether or not the politician pursuing the law was a member of their party, or whether supporting the law would benefit their own political and electoral interests. So it's a complicated mix for them, in terms of their motivation.\n\nSome people have noted that Jesse Jackson, for instance, was against the '94 crime bill. How common was that point of view in black political circles? Was it widely believed that the '94 law would end up being worse for black communities than the crime it was supposed to remedy?\n\nThere were certainly liberals who opposed some elements of the bill, particularly the death penalty element and the three-strikes element. Jesse Jackson is interesting because he was throughout that year opposed to the bill-that's true. But many black leaders didn't agree with everything in the bill at first but made peace with it despite their misgivings. There's an interesting quote from the letter those pastors wrote to the Congressional Black Caucus: \"While we do not agree with every provision in the crime bill, we do believe and emphatically support the bill's goal to save our communities, and most importantly, our children.\" A group of 10 black city mayors also supported the bill. So while there was some opposition in the black community, there was also significant support. Many of the members of the Congressional Black Caucus did try to get rid of some of the more punitive elements in the bill, but in the end they decided to go with the president and support the final bill.\n\nWhat I can say is that comparing the reaction to the Rockefeller laws in 1973, to the war on drugs in the '80s, to the crime bill, there was a growing awareness that the community needed to be careful about running to police and prisons for solutions and that they were beginning to have devastating effects. In fact, Kweisi Mfume [a congressman from Maryland who served as chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus] suggested in 1994 that the crime bill might lead to the incarceration of large groups of African American men. But he still supported the bill. So even though there was this awareness among some, many of them-both for reasons related to crime and because of their own political relationships with the Clintons-decided to support the bill regardless.\n\nSo how should we think about the Clintons' record on criminal justice, in light of what you've said? How do you think people looking at Hillary Clinton as a presidential candidate right now should view her and her husband's legacy on this issue?\n\nFor me it's not a question of how I'd like people to view their legacy. It's more about how I think we should frame the questions about their legacy. Going back to something I said earlier, I think we should consider unintended consequences. There's a way of talking about these things where you argue that the Clintons meant to do this-\"this\" being mass incarceration of African American men. Now, there are a variety of moral and political implications to that claim. But if you believe that the Clintons-like many African American leaders-supported these policies for their own political interests, as well as to help the black community, and that they never intended the outcomes that occurred, that leads to different moral and political implications. We need to have a more complex understanding of the origins of these policies.\n\n* Correction, Feb. 25, 2016: Due to a production error, this piece's photo caption originally misstated that the photo was from 2005.

      "text": "The Messy, Very Human Politics of Bill Clinton's Crime Bill\n\nJeff Haynes/Getty Images\n\nTwenty-two years ago, President Bill Clinton shepherded a comprehensive crime bill through Congress in the midst-though we would later learn it was the tail end-of a yearslong violent crime wave that had claimed close to 25,000 lives the previous year. Many, if not most, of the lost were young and black, victims of drug violence or turf wars or petty theft or just innocent bystanders caught in the crossfire of criminal conflict in inner-city neighborhoods around the country.\n\nTorn apart by violence, these black communities-where churches and activists struggled to keep young people safe and where parents lived in terror of losing everything they had worked for-demanded action. And Clinton came to them, offering \"tough\" policies that might not bring jobs or repair their neighborhoods, but would keep dangerous people off the streets and offer a measure of safety to ordinary people. Backed by many of the most mainstream black lawmakers and community leaders, Clinton took their fears seriously, even as his proposed remedy divided these communities along class and ideological lines. But at a time when death claimed or threatened a whole generation of young people, it was something.\n\nLast week, while campaigning for his wife in Philadelphia before a predominantly black audience of several hundred people, he tried to defend that something against two black protesters. The protesters held signs. \"Clinton crime bill destroyed our communities,\" read one. \"Black people are not super predators,\" said another. Clinton was incensed.\n\n\"Because of that bill,\" he said, \"we had a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in the murder rate. ... Because of that and the background check law we had a 46-year low in the deaths of people by gun violence-and who do you think those lives were? That mattered? Whose lives were saved, that mattered?\"\n\nClinton, by this point visibly frustrated, wouldn't let up. \"This is what's the matter,\" he said, pointing at the signs. \"I don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-olds hopped up on crack and sent them out onto the street to murder other African-American children. Maybe you thought they were good citizens. She didn't! ... You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter! Tell the truth! You are defending the people who caused young people to go out and take guns.\n\n\"I talked to a lot of African-American groups. They thought black lives mattered,\" his voice rising as he took and repurposed the chant against him. \"They said, 'Take this bill, because our kids are being shot in the streets by gangs. We have 13-year-old kids planning their own funerals.' \" He pointed to one of the protesters. \"She doesn't want to hear about that.\"\n\nHere, it's hard not to psychoanalyze Clinton. Between Bernie's challenge from the left and Hillary's decision to move in kind, this presidential campaign is as much a repudiation of his administration as it is a look to the future-Bill Clinton is confronting that as much as anything. But in that confrontation, we vividly see the rapid shift in the politics of crime that has turned his rhetoric-which was once routine for all Democrats-into something that feels out of touch, if not offensive. It's a shift that obscures the degree to which black communities were active participants in the crime debate, both as critics and as supporters. Indeed, Clinton and the protesters are talking past each other and embodying the change in our politics, with the former blind to the new landscape and the latter profoundly informed by it.\n\nIt's worth saying, first, that Bill's defense of Hillary's \"superpredator\" comments doesn't hold up. When Hillary Clinton spoke about \"superpredators\"-referencing a now-debunked theory about crime that had gained currency in both academia and the media-she was talking about the children themselves, supposedly remorseless killers who couldn't be redeemed. They needed to be \"brought to heel.\" For today's activists, this language-which played to white fears of monstrous black youth-is emblematic of a Democratic Party and a political culture that locked away an entire generation of young black men. And while an increasingly brown and black Democratic Party has abandoned that language, it lives on in right-wing rhetoric like the kind that surfaced after the killing of Trayvon Martin.\n\nThe Clintons recognize the ground has shifted. Bill has acknowledged the failures of the crime bill, and Hillary Clinton has both renounced her \"superpredator\" comments and made criminal justice reform a central part of her campaign , lending credence to the idea that Bill's response was more an emotional outburst than a calculated decision.\n\nWhere Bill Clinton was correct (if self-serving) was in the reality of black political support for the bill. Michael Fortner, a professor of urban studies at the City University of New York, makes this point in a February interview with my colleague Leon Neyfakh:\n\n[T]here was grassroots mobilization of the community, particularly by black pastors. There was a group of influential black pastors who signed a letter encouraging the Congressional Black Caucus to support the bill. And then later, on top of that, black elected officials, who portrayed themselves at various points as uncomfortable with some of these laws, went along anyway because of pressure coming from their communities, and because they also realized the problem was so bad.\n\nSupporters saw the bill as a flawed but necessary tool in the fight to save their neighborhoods from drugs and violent crime, which, at that point, had claimed thousands of lives, largely young people. Critics in those same communities saw policies that could lead to greater incarceration and worse outcomes for black communities. Neither group, it turns out, was entirely correct . While the crime bill codified a whole suite of draconian policies into a new national status quo, it wasn't the prime driver of mass incarceration; states and localities, much more than the federal government, drove the explosion in America's prison population. (Today, those same states and localities are the focal point for efforts to shrink the prison population.) And while there's evidence that ties some crime-bill provisions to lower crime-like funds to hire more police officers-in the broad story, the federal government is a relatively minor actor in a complex and overdetermined phenomenon. To that point, researchers still don't know what exactly is responsible for the sustained drop in violent crime since the 1990s.\n\nAll of that is to say that in the 1994 crime bill we have a complicated story of fear, racism, good intentions, and cynical political maneuvering. Did centrist Democrats like Clinton back the bill as part of an effort to win working-class whites from Republicans? Yes. Did many black lawmakers vote for it despite serious reservations, pushed by frightened constituents, concerned by the prospect of a worse bill , ideologically hemmed in by national figures in both parties who wanted punishment, not rehabilitation? Absolutely. Their communities faced the brunt of the crime epidemic, and for them it was either something-a flawed bill-or nothing. It helped that their initial hesitation-and at a point, their outright opposition-brought concessions. The $30 billion omnibus proposal contained nearly $7 billion in programs for preventing crime, from drug courts to grants for low-income communities.\n\nAt the same time, neither Bill Clinton nor the Democratic Party he led is blameless or exonerated for the status quo. No, the crime bill isn't responsible for the rise of mass incarceration. But Clinton is responsible for pushing more humane policies out of the mainstream, with rhetoric that reflected the aggressive posture of local elites and enhanced it with presidential stature. No one forced Bill Clinton to fly back to Arkansas during the 1992 campaign to oversee the execution of Ricky Ray Rector to avoid looking \"soft on crime.\" No one forced other Democrats, like Joe Biden, to tout the death penalty offenses he had written into the crime bill as part of a political drive to \"win\" crime for his party.\n\nDemocrats hungrily followed a conservative consensus on crime, government, and punishment, rejecting less punitive options in favor of federalizing draconian state and local policies that drove the growth in incarceration, all in an (ultimately failed) effort to bring suburban white voters back into the Democratic Party. That these didn't cause the problem doesn't mean they weren't influential. Ordinary Americans demanded action on crime; Democrats helped ensure any action would happen within the narrow ideological band of the carceral state.\n\nBut crime was a serious and urgent problem. And lawmakers of all stripes faced demands to do something. Smart, thoughtful people backed the crime bill in an honest effort to do good. (Bernie Sanders, for instance, spoke out against the bill ... and then cast his vote for it , later calling for tougher penalties for drug possession ). And while Clinton was playing the issue for political gain, he also believed the law was ultimately there to protect Americans from the real and destabilizing threat of violent crime. If he can't quite keep himself from a full-throated defense of the crime bill, it's likely because he still sees it as an important measure that kept ordinary, working people safe, regardless of the reality.\n\nWe can't lose sight of the fact that the crime bill did real damage to countless communities, harming people it was supposed to help. But we also can't turn this into a simple morality play of good guys and bad ones. With the crime bill, there is a real gap between good intentions and actual consequences that is worth considering, not as an excuse or a defense, but as a lesson. A reminder that politics is full of the unintended, and that as a profoundly human endeavor, it's almost never a story of perfect heroes and simple villains.\n\nRead more Slate coverage of the Democratic primary.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Joe Biden Took Away Our Hope in Prison Overnight. He's Finally Given It Back.\n\nThis story is published in partnership with Open Campus , a nonprofit newsroom focused on higher education. Subscribe to College Inside , an Open Campus newsletter on the future of postsecondary education in prison.\n\nThree decades ago, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act-also known as the 1994 crime bill-took a sledgehammer to federal financial aid for incarcerated students. On July 1, though, people in prison were finally again eligible to receive Pell Grants for higher education for the first time in 29 years.\n\nWith the return of Pell , it will take colleges and corrections departments a while to figure out exactly what these new prison education programs will entail. But it's a significant step forward toward expanding college access for people in prison.\n\nEver since I started covering prison education in fall 2021, I've been asking everyone I meet who was incarcerated before 1994, \"What was that moment like when Pell Grants went away?\"\n\nI've talked to a dozen men and women-most of whom are lifers now in the 50s, 60s, or 70s (and at least one octogenarian )-about the ebb and flow of prison education over the past four decades.\n\nFor many people inside, education was \"here one day and gone the next,\" essentially stranding thousands of incarcerated students in the middle of their degrees. Sean Pica, now the executive director of Hudson Link , entered prison in 1987 as a 16-year-old with a ninth grade education.\n\nAfter a lot of false starts, he had finally earned 118 credits toward a bachelor's from Skidmore College when the 1994 crime bill passed. \"At this point, it's not getting taken away because I fucked up,\" he said. \"So, in some ways, you're a little resentful that I'm finally getting my shit together. And now I'm still not finishing .\"\n\nSkidmore came in and packed up their books and supplies with very little explanation, he said. \"And then it was just gone.\"\n\nAs the prison education pendulum has finally swayed back, we asked several lifers to share their experiences with Pell Grants before 1994, in their own words.\n\nThese stories have been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\n-An account from Ghostwrite Mike\n\nAs the old-school California Youth Authority van pulled into the infamous Youth Training School, I thought my life was over. It was, at the time, California's largest youth prison, known as \"gladiator school.\"\n\nIt was 1991. I'd spent the previous two years fighting and losing a juvenile court fitness hearing for a shooting I committed as a 16-year-old. I got transferred to adult court, refused a deal, lost a first-degree murder trial, and wound up sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. I was a classic case of what they today would call a \"youth offender.\" Back then, we were \"superpredators.\"\n\nThere was one redeemable thing about gladiator school-I discovered that the facility actually had a Pell-funded bachelor's program in sociology from the University of La Verne. For a kid who acquired his GED in juvenile hall at the age of 16, being able to perhaps parlay my woes into a college degree was the only inspiring thing in my life.\n\nI eagerly enrolled and quickly knocked down 39 units. But then, in fall 1992, a race riot landed me time in solitary confinement, a DA referral, and a gnarly shipout to an even more volatile youth facility. Over the next 15 years, during which time Congress killed our access to Pell Grants, I spent most of my time in and out of administrative segregation.\n\nIt wasn't until I was doing my last long-term stint in the hole that I started to contemplate a different mode of life on the inside. While in lockup, I'd received a reply letter from Thomas Aquinas College in Ojai, California, a renowned Jesuit school that taught the Great Books Series as its curriculum, responding to my request for donated paperback philosophy books. One of the professors there visited me regularly, became my friend, and caused me to contemplate universals, question my ethics, and deconstruct my malformed ideas about my purpose on the planet.\n\nI own my mistakes, going on the ride of being a follower trying to survive the idiotic politics I was too afraid to buck. My beef is with the obstacles placed in the way of the academic climb I've tried to make since then, after I changed my life, flipped my script, and started to explore my capacity to exist beyond the limiting confines of what I'd been indoctrinated to accept for myself.\n\nI've been on never-ending college program waitlists for nearly 10 years, while staying discipline-free, dropping custody points, and earning my way from maximum-security prisons to the medium-security facility I've been at since 2018. After every transfer, I had to start the waitlist climb again, from the bottom rung of a ladder that placed me last due to my life sentence.\n\nIt took me more than 30 years to get back on track. 1992 to 2023-do that math.\n\nGhostwrite Mike is a student at Coastline College, transferring to Merced College in the fall. He's a published poet, illustrator, producer, and journalist. His work has appeared in Exchange , a literary magazine published by Columbia University School of the Arts. He's the co-founder of Barz Behind Bars (B3), and managing editor of the BarzOnline literary blog for the Ben Free Project , and a consultant for the nonprofit Radical Reversal .\n\n-An account from Charmaine Pfender\n\nI arrived at Muncy in 1985 and college classes were already a mainstay. I took my GED, then enrolled at Bloomsburg College. We had two classes a semester and Pell paid it all. A couple years later, Bill Clinton ended Pell Grants for prisoners. A lot of people were pissed.\n\nI could no longer afford to go. I had to drop out of college. I hated to do that, because I was emotionally abused as a child and my father was illiterate. He always told me I'd never amount to anything and wasn't smart enough to do anything with my life. So, the fact that I had a life sentence made me feel he was right, until I discovered college.\n\nCollege changed everything. It made me feel like an adult for the first time. And I discovered my identity and intelligence. When it went away, I was dejected and sad I couldn't accomplish graduating. I would have been the first in my family.\n\nI focused all my attention on my apprenticeship-a multitrade program through the Pennsylvania Department of Labor. My certification is as a maintenance builder, repairer, servicer. It took six years to graduate. We had to build custom furniture for staff to fund the program.\n\nAfter I graduated, I went on to specialize in carpentry at the maintenance department for 15 years. I also went to school for computers, and then took a course in AutoCAD to use with carpentry. And then took Accounting I, II, and III. I planned a future in carpentry, to open my own business. I just need to find my way out of here to do it.\n\nCharmaine Pfender has served 35 years in the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. She is 1 of 3 original founders of the nonprofit Let's Get Free: The Women and Trans Prisoner Defense Committee .\n\n-An account from Mark Wilson\n\nMethamphetamine derailed my 1987 high school graduation. I was then locked in a small jail cell facing murder charges three weeks later. Soon thereafter, I was sentenced to life within the Oregon State Correctional Institution.\n\nI was relieved to find that prison was much more like a college than the violent war zone I feared, thanks to the education opportunities offered by Pell Grants. The prison offered two- and four-year college degrees, vocational training, and apprenticeships in numerous professions. Approximately 20 percent of the 1,000 prisoners at the prison were taking classes. New prisoners were constantly encouraged to join them, but I could not see a future for myself after being told I would die in a cage.\n\nThankfully, there were good people here who cared much more about me and my future than I did. I thought I was done with school after a woman in the education department helped me quickly earn my high school diploma. But she immediately encouraged me to enroll in college.\n\nTruthfully, I was afraid of enrolling because I still believed the lie that I had internalized for so many years: that I was not smart enough to ever have academic success. Fortunately, she refused to take no for an answer and finally convinced me to give it a try. I eventually earned a two-year degree on March 17, 1995.\n\nEarning a degree helped free me from a psychological prison that I had constructed for myself as a child. It made me finally believe that I could achieve and become so much more than I ever imagined possible. It is a sad irony that I discovered this freedom only in a cage, but prison education was an essential key to my personal freedom.\n\nFinally understanding the value of education, I wanted to continue, but my educational journey came to a screeching halt. Congress abolished prisoner Pell Grants just six months before I graduated, and I could not pursue a four-year degree because both colleges quickly left in 1995.\n\nSadly, my fellow prisoners and I witnessed guards gleefully celebrating as college classes ended.\n\nMark Wilson, 54, has been an Oregon prisoner since 1987. He earned a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Oregon in 2019. Since 2019, he has served as a member of a legislative working group seeking to improve prison educational opportunities.\n\n-An account from Craig Muhammad\n\nIn 1982, I started my incarceration in the Maryland State Penitentiary, where 90 percent of incarcerated persons were serving life sentences. The other 10 percent were serving virtual life sentences (50 years and above). College programs, such as Coppin State College (now Coppin State University, an HBCU), were one of the few tools available for an incarcerated person to improve himself and to stay positively focused away from destructive behavior. A few incarcerated people were also earning master's degrees.\n\nI can vividly recall the disappointed faces after the college coordinator, Ms. Yolanda Hendricks, informed incarcerated people that the undergraduate program was going to cease operations. Being part of that program was like a badge of honor. It also encouraged students to earn their GEDs so they could go to college.\n\nIt really felt like I was in a comfort zone when I earned my GED and then went to college. I was so proud of myself when I walked across that stage in 1989 and received my degree.\n\nThe most devastating effect of the Pell Grant removal was an increase in hopelessness. With hopelessness comes an array of destructive and self-destructive behavior.\n\nNinety percent of all programs in the penitentiary were created by incarcerated people that had earned a degree or were in pursuit of a degree. When the Pell Grants ceased, many of those programs eventually stopped functioning. The programs that remained were taken over by prison officials and were only a fragment of what they once were.\n\nCraig Muhammad has used education to reach back and help his incarcerated peers to become better human beings. He is a writing tutor for the University of Baltimore Second Chance College Program, a trained peer support specialist, and a facilitator for the Georgetown University Law Center Legal Writing Program.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "It's Time for a New Crime Bill\n\nIt's time for Democrats to propose a new crime bill.\n\nNo, not one like the original 1994 crime bill, famously spearheaded by President Joe Biden when he was a senator. While the role that piece of legislation played in fueling mass incarceration has often been exaggerated , its emphasis on building new prisons and nudging states to adopt harsher criminal penalties effectively doubled down on America's unnecessarily punitive approach to justice and public safety.\n\nDemocrats don't want to-and shouldn't-do that. Instead, the party should cue up a more enlightened sequel full of popular ideas that will make communities safer without resorting to simply locking more Americans up. Think summer jobs for teens. Think funding for drug rehab centers. And yes, maybe think about more money for better-trained police.\n\nThe reasons why Democrats ought to act should be obvious to anybody who has been reading the news lately. After spiking to a height not seen in decades during 2020, America's murder rate has continued to rise . The problem should not be exaggerated: While homicides are up, overall crime is not , and the pace of killings is still far below the crisis levels of the 1980s and early 1990s. It's also possible we are living through the unruly aftereffects of the coronavirus crisis that will fade as the country gets back to normal. But lives are being lost while violence traumatizes families and whole communities where the sense of public safety is collapsing, especially poorer Black and Hispanic neighborhoods, where shootings are concentrated. In some cities, like Washington, the uptick is an acceleration of trends that began before COVID, suggesting the new climate of violence might linger. It makes moral sense to take federal action.\n\nAnd it makes political sense, since there are signs that voters are becoming worried about the issue. For instance, the share of adults who believe that crime is a \"very serious\" problem is now at a 20-year high, according to a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll . This isn't simply a panic among Trump-voting conservatives: This week in New York City, Brooklyn Borough President and former police officer Eric Adams sewed up the Democratic nomination for mayor after campaigning hard on public safety, which residents said was their No. 1 issue .\n\nIt is unclear exactly how much of a political liability the homicide wave presents for national Democrats. The Washington Post-ABC poll found that Biden's approval rating on crime was underwater, with 38 percent approving and 48 percent disapproving. But according to Gallup, only 3 percent of Americans believe that crime is the most important issue facing the country. While there have been endless debates about whether activists' calls to \"defund the police\" after the George Floyd protests hurt Democrats in 2020, Republican attempts to bludgeon them over the slogan don't seem to have worked well in a recent special election for the House. What's more, given a choice between Democrats and Republicans, voters seem just about equally divided over which party would handle crime better, in line with the country's overall level of polarization .\n\nBut while crime might not be an immediate threat for the Democrats, it could become more of a problem if homicides continue to drift up. As New York's Eric Levitz wrote in a great recent piece , such a rise would not just be a danger for the White House or congressional Democrats, but progressives and leftists as a whole, \"since frightened electorates are often reactionary ones.\"\n\nSo far, Biden's response has been a bit underwhelming. His philosophy is very clear and sensible given the politics of the moment: Instead of diverting money away from law enforcement and toward social programs that address the root causes of crime, as many progressives have advocated, he thinks we should just spend more money on both. But the execution hasn't left much of an impression. Last month, the president announced a new anti-crime strategy , and aside from steps by law enforcement agencies aimed at cracking down on illegal gun sales, it mostly consisted of voluntary proposals for states to use some of their COVID relief funds to cover things like summer jobs for teens and more police, or small pots of administrative spending like, for instance, $89 million for \"youth workforce development.\"\n\nAgain, many of Biden's ideas are good on the merits but lack oomph because they're essentially suggestions. An actual crime bill that crystalized the Democratic approach to this issue and explicitly funded it would be more effective both substantively and in terms of messaging. People know infrastructure is a top priority for Joe Biden, because he's actually trying to pass a bill paying for more of it. Crime? At the moment, not so much.\n\nIf the only way to appease voters on this issue was to resort back to the old \"tough on crime\" framework, there would be good reason to be wary of tackling it. But as my colleague Ben Mathis-Lilley pointed out Wednesday, Americans actually seem to agree with progressives that the best way to deal with crime right now is to address many of the underlying social problems that fuel it. According to the Washington Post-ABC poll, 75 percent Americans believe that \"increasing funding for economic opportunities in poor areas\" would reduce violence, compared with 55 percent who say the same about increasing police funding. This seems like an excellent opportunity to give voters what they want-especially since there is strong empirical evidence that many of the supposedly touchy-feely anti-crime ideas that progressives advocate like youth jobs and urban infrastructure improvements can actually have an immediate impact on crime rates.\n\nWhat exactly would the bill look like? Unfortunately, regulatory gun control measures are probably out, because the Senate is still cursed with the filibuster. But in keeping with Biden's \"why not both?\" approach, Democrats could put together a spending bill, passable on a party-line vote as part of a budget reconciliation package, that combines nonpolice violence-reductions methods that progressives love-John Jay's College of Criminal Justice produced a long list of approaches last year-with some more traditional law enforcement spending favored by moderates who want nothing more than to show they aren't interested in defunding the police. Here are a few things it could contain. Most of them would be worthwhile even if they didn't cut crime, but the evidence also suggests they are potentially powerful public safety tools.\n\nYoung men in their late teens are especially prone to committing violent felonies, so it's common sense that providing them with summer jobs that keep them out of trouble, help them support their families, and perhaps teach some life skills would help reduce crime. What's startling is just how dramatic some studies have suggested the impact can be. In 2012, a group of researchers led by the University of Pennsylvania's Sara Heller conducted an experiment in which they randomly assigned more than 1,600 disadvantaged Chicago teenagers to summer job programs. Within a year, it led to a 45 percent decline in violent arrests among those offered a spot. An observational study of New York's summer youth employment program found that, for those who took part, it reduced the chance of being arrested for a felony that summer by 23 percent .\n\nDrug addiction and crime are tightly connected in the United States, and improving treatment for the former would also certainly help combat the latter. Decades of research suggest that substance users who receive treatment are substantially less likely to engage in criminal activity. But as Texas A&M University economist Jennifer Doleac explained a couple of years back, more recent studies have finally shown that \"increasing access to treatment makes the entire community better off\" by reducing overall levels of violence and property crime.\n\nA 2016 paper found that opening additional drug treatment facilities was an incredibly cost-effective way to reduce local crime, including homicides: It calculated that for every $1 in new spending, counties saved around $4 in crime-related expenses. Meanwhile, at least two papers have found that expanding Medicaid, which pays for both drug and mental health treatment, to more low-income adults reduced reports of crimes ranging from murder to assault to robbery.\n\nCan infrastructure spending combat crime? The experts say yes. Politicians and urban planners have long assumed that keeping streets well lit was an easy way to reduce crime and keep residents safe. And while studies by criminologists have sometimes disagreed , a landmark experiment conducted in New York City during 2016 concluded that the conventional wisdom was in fact right . The researchers-from the University of Chicago Crime Lab, the University of Oregon, and University of Pennsylvania-placed lighting towers at or around 40 randomly assigned public housing projects. They found that, after taking into account illegal activity that simply moved elsewhere, the nighttime brights cut index crimes by at least 36 percent. Spending money to illuminate dimly lit urban streets and alleys might well save lives.\n\nEver since the George Floyd protests last year, sending social workers instead of police to deal with 911 calls for mental health emergencies and other distress situations that don't involve crime has become one of the more popular ideas among criminal justice reformers. Eugene, Oregon, has run a version of such a program for decades , called CAHOOTS, and other cities have been adopting the concept. (Denver has been giving it a well-received trial run ). The idea is to try and give people in distress the mental health help or whatever other assistance they need in situations where a police officer without the proper training might otherwise escalate with deadly results, or needlessly arrest someone in crisis. On its face, this doesn't strictly seem like a crime reduction strategy. But the public seems to think it is. According to the Washington Post-ABC poll, 65 percent Americans also seem to think it would reduce violence. So why not throw funding into a crime bill? Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen and California Rep. Karen Bass have even written up a piece of legislation that would work.\n\nSpeaking of alternatives to traditional policing, Congress could also provide more funding specifically for violence interruptor programs, made famous by a 2011 documentary, where nonprofit workers, often including ex-gang members, act as mediators to diffuse disputes before they turn deadly. The efforts have been shown to reduce shootings and homicides in cities including New York , Chicago , and Baltimore . As part of its crime-prevention plan, the Biden administration is already working with 15 cities that have pledged to spend some money on so-called community violence interventions along these lines, but earmarking more federal cash for the initiatives could give them a longer runway to grow.\n\nCongress is not going to pass new gun control measures. But it could at least properly fund the agency responsible for implementing what meager regulations we have. Thanks to years of aggressive lobbying by the National Rifle Association, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives has been rendered into a financially crippled shell that is literally banned from digitizing gun records, forcing its staff to track guns by combing through paper records. More money would help ATF do its job properly. Biden has asked for the funding. Congress should provide it.\n\nObviously, this last suggestion will rub some progressives the wrong way. But the bottom line is that very few Americans actually favor the idea of literally defunding the police, or scaling back their presence in communities. And contra the claims of activists, the up-to-date academic evidence consistently shows that policing does reduce crime, not necessarily because they are brilliant at solving it, but because people are less likely to commit a shooting or car jacking if there's an officer 20 feet away. As the progressive Princeton sociologist Patrick Sharkey has written , \"One of the most robust, most uncomfortable findings in criminology is that putting more officers on the street leads to less violent crime.\"\n\nAside from being a potentially effective way to reduce crime, police spending is also obviously very popular with mainstream Democrats. That group includes Joe Biden, who during the presidential campaign proposed increasing funding for the old Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS, grant program, which was created as part of the 1994 crime bill to help put 100,000 new officers on the street. But progressives don't necessarily have to treat police funding as a sacrifice if they attach strict requirements that require departments to update some of their wildly insufficient and outdated training that turns police into hair-trigger gunmen. We could hire more officers, and fewer warriors .\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Clintons Aren't to Blame for Mass Incarceration\n\nRobert Giroux/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHillary Clinton's record on criminal justice has dogged her throughout the 2016 campaign, thanks in large part to a federal crime bill that she vocally supported when her husband signed it into law in 1994. The law contained many separate provisions, but its overall thrust was to make criminal penalties harsher and to make the justice system less forgiving. Although Clinton has said on the trail that the law went too far and that she now wants to make the criminal justice system less punitive, critics have pointed to her support for the '94 law as evidence that she is, at heart, a believer in tough-on-crime policies that disproportionately affect minorities.\n\nThis week, an essay in the Nation written by Michelle Alexander stated that Bill and Hillary Clinton should be held responsible for what we now call our mass incarceration problem, with an astonishing 1.56 million people currently serving time in state and federal prisons. As champions of a law that resulted in billions being spent on \"constructing a ﻿vast new penal system\" that has ravaged black communities, Alexander argued, the Clintons are not deserving of votes from black Americans. The message carries a great deal of weight coming from Alexander, whose 2010 book The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness has proved enormously influential in shaping the national conversation around the need for prison reform. Alexander's essay reverberated widely, and it would be surprising if Clinton and Bernie Sanders were not asked about it at Thursday night's Democratic debate.\n\nBut how much did Clinton-era policies on criminal justice actually contribute to mass incarceration? Some experts say their impact has been massively overstated-and that the 1994 bill in particular had much less of an effect on the prison population than Clinton's detractors would have it. One expert who is skeptical of the 1994 bill's influence is John Pfaff, a professor at Fordham University School of Law who studies prison policy from an empirical perspective. I called Pfaff to discuss the Alexander article, and the degree to which Hillary Clinton can be held to account for mass incarceration. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nNeyfakh: According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics , the combined state and federal prison population in the U.S. went from 882,500 at the end of 1992, when Bill Clinton was elected, to 1,394,231 at the end of 2000, when he left office. Referring to these numbers, Michelle Alexander opens her argument by saying Bill Clinton \"presided over the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history.\" Is that true?\n\nPfaff: It's technically true, in that it's true that during Clinton's years in office, more total people were added to U.S. prisons than during any other president's administration. But the U.S. prison population had been growing steadily for almost 20 years before Clinton came into office, and it didn't seem to grow any faster during his presidency.\n\nIt didn't?\n\nNo. In fact, what you see in the prison population is a steady upward trend from 1974 till around 2000, at which point prison growth starts to plateau a bit.\n\nWhat about the drug war? In her Nation essay, Alexander argues that Clinton \"﻿escalated it beyond what many conservatives had imagined possible.\"\n\nI have a hard time seeing it. The percent of people in prison on drug charges nationwide peaked in 1991. And since 1991, it has more or less steadily declined. Now, it's true that the total number of people in prison on drug charges went up, but the whole prison population was going up along with it. The rate of growth for drug offenders in prison actually slowed down during the Clinton years; it didn't speed up. Between 1980 and 1990, a third of all state prison growth was due to more drug offenders being sent to prison. During that period, the total number of state drug offenders rose from 19,000 to 149,000. Between 1990 and 2009-so, two decades, rather than just one decade-the number went from 149,000 to 242,000.\n\nCourtesy of John Pfaff\n\nThose are all state prison numbers. What about the federal system?\n\nThe number of federal drug prisoners did go up: Between 1992 and 2000, the number of federal drug inmates rose from around 43,000 to just under 75,000. To put that in perspective, the total U.S. prison population grew by over 511,000 during that time. The increase in federal drug inmates was less than 6 percent of that total.\n\nBut that leads to my other problem with saying Clinton \"presided over\" the prison growth: I think it gives him too much agency. It's true that Clinton had some control over the federal system, but he had almost none over the states, and almost all the growth in prison populations during his two terms occurred in the states-87 percent of the increase, if only because most prisoners are held in state prisons.\n\nSo as a strictly chronological matter, yes, it is true that the Clinton years saw the single greatest increase in the number of U.S. prison inmates compared to any other presidency. What that implies about his centrality to that growth-that's where I have a much harder time. You could also argue that by the end of the Clinton administration, I was older than I was when he began, but no one would say that Clinton \"presided over\" my getting older.\n\nBut what about the 1994 crime bill that Bill Clinton signed and Hillary Clinton championed? That was a huge and consequential law, wasn't it?\n\nThe key provisions were that it created a lot more federal crimes, it expanded the scope of the federal death penalty, and it expanded the scope of the federal three strikes laws. Those get a lot of attention, but again, it's important to realize they only apply to the federal system, and that's a very narrow slice of the overall prison population. Very few things fall under the category of \"federal crime.\" Outside of guns and drugs it's very hard to get sent to federal prison.\n\nYou make it sound like a pretty dinky law.\n\nWell, no, it did other things too. One big part of it was the Violence Against Women Act, which expanded the scope of laws against domestic violence. Another was the COPS program, which was designed to try to get state and local governments to hire an extra 100,000 police officers nationwide. It also abolished Pell Grants for prisoners. And then in terms of state prisons, the most potentially important aspect of the law was the truth-in-sentencing grants, which authorized something on the order of $10 billion to give to states that adopted very restrictive parole rules, though less than $3 billion was awarded in the end.\n\nHow did the truth-in-sentencing provisions work?\n\nThey said that for certain violent felonies, you had to serve at least 85 percent of your sentence before you could get parole. The feds basically offered states millions of dollars if they were willing to making it harder for people to get parole or early release. And the money was to be spent on expanding prison capacity for the expected increase in incarcerated offenders.\n\nIn many ways, I think the truth-in-sentencing part of the 1994 law highlights the weakness of federal criminal policy. The feds can never tell the states what to do-all they can do is either offer them cash or threaten to withhold cash they're already giving them to try to induce them to take certain actions. It's very hard for the federal government to tell the states, \"You must change your sentencing laws.\" They can only try to sort of bribe them. And states regularly ignore these incentives.\n\nOK. So if we're trying to determine how much blame the Clintons deserve for mass incarceration, it seems like the central question should be about the actual impact of the 1994 law. Intuitively, it sounds like it would result in more people going to prison for longer periods of time. But let's break it down into component parts. Did the number of people convicted of felonies every year go up?\n\nI wish I could tell you the trend in conviction rates, but we have incredibly limited data on prosecutorial outcomes. We don't have a good national data set at all on conviction, which is a pretty shocking and unacceptable gap in our data on criminal justice. What we do have is some data on how many felony cases were filed in state courts. And the number of felony cases filed in state courts rose by about 10 to 20 percent between 1994 and 2000, and by about 40 percent between 1994 and 2008.\n\nWhat about the number of people being sent to prison every year?\n\nAdmissions to prison go up during that time as well: From 1994 to 2000, annual state admissions rise from about 514,000 to about 618,000. And in the federal system it goes from about 27,000 to around 48,000.\n\nDid the average length of a prison stay go up as a result of the '94 law?\n\nWell, contrary to what we frequently hear, once people are admitted to state prison, they don't really spend that much time there-the median time to release is between one and three years, and that doesn't seem to have really changed that much during this period of 1994 and 2000.\n\nThat's surprising. Why didn't the truth-in-sentencing grants that the federal government was offering to the states result in fewer people getting parole and early release?\n\nYeah, it is a little surprising, because you'd think states that were adopting these tougher sentencing laws and these tougher parole standards would result in a change in time served. And you'd expect that effect to come a couple of years after the '94 bill goes into effect, which means that as you enter the 2000s, you'd expect the rate of prison growth to increase as you enter the 2000s. But it actually slows down.\n\nI want to go back to your first point about the growth in the prison population not speeding up under Clinton. Wasn't there a huge crime decline that began in 1991 and shouldn't we factor that in?\n\nYes. Between 1994 and 2000, the violent crime rate drops by almost 30 percent, and the property crime rate drops by over 20 percent. The total number of arrests drops too. In 1994 there were a total of 14.7 million arrests, and in 2000, Clinton's last year in office, there were 13.99 million arrests. And if we just look at serious crimes, arrests drop from 754,000 to 625,000 for violent crimes and from 2.1 million to 1.6 million for property crimes.\n\nWhat about drug arrests?\n\nDrug sale and manufacturing arrests-which are the drug arrests most likely to result in prison time-basically stay flat at about 330,000. Possession arrests do rise, from 750,000 to 1.25 million, but drug possession charges almost never result in prison time.\n\nSo is there an argument to be made that, were it not for Clinton's policies, the crime decline would have caused felony charges and annual prison admissions to go down during his presidency? Were his efforts to make the system more punitive just offset by the fact that fewer people were getting arrested?\n\nI'm skeptical of that. Given that prison sentences didn't get any longer following the '94 law, the growth in the prison population is explained primarily by a rise in admissions, and admissions are really controlled by local DAs, because they're the ones who decide which arrestees should face felony charges. And local DAs are basically accountable to nobody, except perhaps the county electorate.\n\nIs there any reason to think that DAs started charging more aggressively because of Clinton's crime bill?\n\nI can't say it's impossible, but I would be surprised. I don't see why this bill would have changed their behavior in any real way. Other than the incentives for states to pass truth-in-sentencing laws, none of what was in the bill would have affected the states all that much. And the fact of the matter is, there's evidence that local DAs ignore state laws too. My favorite example is that Nelson Rockefeller, when he was governor of New York, passed the Rockefeller drug laws in 1973-but the number of drug felons in New York state court didn't move until 1984. So for 10 years you had this draconian drug law on the books, and the local DAs just ignored it. Then crack hit, and New York started sending all these people to prison on drug charges. So, if New York state DAs are more or less ignoring what Albany is doing, I can't imagine they're being driven that much by what D.C. is doing.\n\nSome people argue that the rhetoric around criminal justice under the Clintons created a climate in which being tough on crime was seen as normal, which contributed indirectly to the growth of the prison system.\n\nRight, so, if the Clintons had any real effect, it would have had to be more rhetorical than legal. And it's true that Hillary Clinton's rhetoric when it came to crime-she said that young \"superpredators\" had to be \"brought to heel\"-is profoundly troubling. It's hard not to see a problematic racial overtone to a statement like that. But I think the question is, did the rhetoric around the '94 act cause greater toughness at the local level, or was that rhetoric a reflection of what people were already thinking at the local level?\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nToo often we look at what the national politicians say, and we think they're shaping local attitudes. I wonder if it runs the other direction-that the politicians are very good at reading local attitudes and responding to them. There is some new political science evidence suggesting that congressional attitudes toward crime reflect underlying fears of crime more than they drive them. And in the early '90s, there was still a lot of political pressure to respond to crime.\n\nBut crime started going down in 1991. Shouldn't the Clintons have resisted political pressure to make the system more punitive, if only just on that basis?\n\nWell, so, the crime bill was enacted in 1994, right? In terms of the available data, they had maybe '92 and '93 to look at, so that's only one or two years into the crime decline. And the thing to remember is that violent crime had dropped from '80 to '84, as well, and then when crack hit, it spiked again. So, yes, crime had started to drop, and in hindsight we know it was the onset of a dramatic, long-term decline. But at the time it just looked like the same kind of lull we had between '80 and '84. It would have required profound foresight for the Clintons to have realized in 1994 that crime was actually going down.\n\nOK. So, from everything you're saying, it sounds like the '94 crime bill didn't contribute to mass incarceration in the way some people think. But when it comes to evaluating the Clintons' record on criminal justice, isn't it fair to hold the spirit of the law-and the rhetoric they talked used to talk about it-against them?\n\nI think that's completely fair. And even at the time people said that doubling down on longer sentences and even more draconian punishment was not the way to address the crime problem. The federal three strikes laws, the expanded federal death penalty, the truth in sentencing grants-even at the time you could have said, \"This is not great policy, and it's not going to do what you want it to do.\" But that's different from saying that those policies actually caused mass incarceration to happen. The truth is we were well on our way to mass incarceration by that point. The trend was already set and nothing changed before or after 1994 in terms of how that trend was moving.\n\nThe reason I push so hard against this idea that the 1994 act caused mass incarceration is not just a desire for historical accuracy, although I think that's important. It's that saying that the 1994 act caused mass incarceration seems to imply that the federal government can get us out of the problem too. If Clinton passed a law that caused this to happen, then conceivably D.C. should be able to pass a law that reverses this problem. And that's just not right. This is not a federal issue. And to stress that the feds didn't cause it is important because it drives home the fact that if you really want to fix it, you have to go state by state, county by county, and change state criminal codes, change DA charging practices, and change how the plea bargaining system works. Nothing can come out of D.C. that can fix this because it's not really a fed-created problem. And that's what really bothers me about this '94 act narrative. By saying the Clintons caused it, it suggests whoever is president next can fix it. And that's just not true.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

      "text": "The Reverse Mass Incarceration Act Won't Reverse Mass Incarceration\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nOn Wednesday, Sens. Cory Booker and Richard Blumenthal introduced a bill with an ambitious goal . The Reverse Mass Incarceration Act is a proposal to amend the 1994 omnibus crime bill passed under President Clinton, which earmarked $12.5 billion in federal grants for states that passed harsher criminal sentencing laws. The new bill aims to do the opposite, by offering $20 billion in federal grant money over 10 years to states that decrease their prison populations by at least 7 percent over three years.\n\nThe proposal holds obvious appeal for criminal justice reformers who are disturbed by the return to staunch law-and-order policies under the Trump administration. As attorney general, Jeff Sessions has already directed prosecutors to seek maximum penalties in criminal cases, undoing the modest reforms made by the Obama Justice Department.\n\n\"The bill will encourage state and local governments to continue reform efforts despite what Sessions is doing,\" says Inimai Chettiar, justice program director at the Brennan Center for Justice, which helped write the legislation and conducted the research it's based on. The initiative has attracted support across the civil rights community-from the NAACP's Washington bureau to the National Urban League and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. The bill's backers say the incentives embedded in the law could reduce imprisonment rates by 20 percent nationwide over the next 10 years.\n\nDespite this wide-ranging support, the bill thus far lacks a Republican sponsor. Sources on Capitol Hill say the absence of GOP interest, along with the attorney general's overt hostility to criminal justice reform, means the chances of it moving forward any time soon are slim to none. Legislation with broad bipartisan support such as the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act has struggled to move forward in this Congress, much less efforts led by the minority party. Although Trump senior advisor Jared Kushner met with conservative Sens. Chuck Grassley and Mike Lee in March, reportedly to discuss criminal justice reform , it remains unclear whether the meeting produced any forward movement on reform efforts. Chettiar, who is aware of the uphill battle the bill faces, says the goal is \"to build more support over time.\"\n\nIn a statement, Booker said his aim is to \"encourage states to reduce their prison populations and invest money in evidence-based practices proven to reduce crime and recidivism.\" There are many successful examples of justice reinvestment initiatives like this one, in which money saved by reducing incarceration is reinvested in communities. It's a principle that has a proven track record of helping cash-strapped states reduce incarceration rates and save money, and conservative groups like Right on Crime have expressed support for changing federal criminal justice grant incentives . But some criminal justice experts are skeptical that these relatively small grants are the best way forward.\n\n\"There's tremendous political risk to cutting back [on incarceration], so I'm not sure you can just incentivize your way out of growth,\" says John Pfaff, a Fordham law professor and the author of the book Locked In: The True Causes of Mass Incarceration-and How to Achieve Real Reform . Of the $12.5 billion in federal funds earmarked by the 1994 crime bill for states that introduced tougher sentencing laws, Pfaff says only $2.7 billion was claimed, an indication \"that these federal grants are kind of ignored.\"\n\nThe Booker-Blumenthal bill also mandates that a state is eligible for grant money only if its overall prison population drops by at least 7 percent and its crime rate increases by no more than 3 percent. Chettiar says this requirement is a way \"to make the point that incarceration and crime are not inherently linked.\"\n\nThis makes very little sense as a matter of policy. As the Brennan Center itself has illustrated in a series of in-depth reports , crime rates can increase or decrease for myriad reasons: unemployment rates, changes in drug markets, economic stability, lead exposure. When crime rates in the U.S. peaked in 1990 and began to steadily drop , researchers struggled-and continue to struggle-to identify the main drivers of the decline. Social, environmental, and economic factors proved far more influential in reducing crime than incarceration rates, according to the Brennan Center's 2015 study. That's not to suggest incarceration has no effect on crime: A 2005 study from the Sentencing Project found 25 percent of the decrease in violent crime rates during the 1990s could be attributed to increased imprisonment. Still, that leaves 75 percent of the reduction outside the realm of incarceration.\n\nThe gains in reducing crime that may be attributed to incarceration also come at a heavy price. The neighborhoods hit hardest by high incarceration rates are low-income areas that lack social services that are easily attained in more affluent communities. People of color are disproportionately represented in these communities, and in the prison system. In spite of a heavy police presence, these are also the same neighborhoods that are most heavily victimized by violent crime. Yet because of limited social resources and political capital, those most affected by crime aren't often engaged in policy discussions about how to stamp it out.\n\nWhat's more, this bill is unlikely to motivate some of the most important stakeholders in the fight to reduce incarceration rates: local prosecutors. Prosecutors' associations are some of the most powerful institutions speaking out for tough sentencing. (Recent setbacks to reform in Louisiana, for example, came largely thanks to opposition from prosecutors.) Even if states fund crime reduction programs with federal grants, that won't change the power, autonomy, and immunity enjoyed by most prosecutors, who ultimately decide who will be charged and how harshly.\n\nPfaff acknowledges that the bill could encourage states to think creatively about how to rein in prison growth but thinks it's \"not enough money to encourage them to do that aggressively.\" Without considering what motivates key players like prosecutors who consistently oppose reform, a well-intentioned law with a meager budget is unlikely to bring about the change it promises.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Why Joe Biden Gets Away With It\n\nJoe Biden, the Democratic front-runner, has had a peculiar couple of weeks: The points on which he's been historically weak-women's rights, mass incarceration, and plagiarism-have surfaced again, as weak points are bound to do, but if his responses on all three fronts have muddied his record, they haven't done much damage to his vaunted \"electability.\" He's reiterated his support (before retracting it) of the Hyde Amendment, which prevents federal funds like Medicaid from paying for abortions. He's defended his 1994 crime bill , which contributed (many believe) to America's mass incarceration problem. Asked at a recent event whether he'd \"commit to reducing the prison population by half,\" Biden claimed that the woman asking-whom he addressed as \"kiddo\"-had been \"conditioned\" to say it was a bad bill. But \"we should not be putting people in prison for drug offenses,\" he added, omitting that he was one of the architects of the war on drugs and had specifically criticized then-President Bush's plan because it didn't \"hold every drug user accountable.\" Finally, his campaign was found to have plagiarized some policy language.\n\nOf the aforementioned items, the plagiarism might be both the least concerning and the most instructive. While Biden's campaign seems to have copied some language from the BlueGreen Alliance and the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, this, as Politico points out , is far from exceptional. Plenty of other campaigns have done much the same thing. The issue for Biden is that the incident hooks up with a reputation problem: an earlier instance of plagiarism that caused him to pull out of the 1988 presidential race.\n\nWhat remains concerning about that history is Biden's tendency to enthusiastically claim life experiences that aren't his own, whether because it's politically advantageous or rhetorically exciting to do so. He didn't just use hefty chunks from a published law review for a 15-page paper in law school. He didn't just lift some phrases from Bobby Kennedy . In 1987, Biden started borrowing not just language but biographical details from U.K. Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock, citing nonexistent coal-mining ancestors and wondering aloud why he was the first in his family to go to college (he wasn't). Biden also lied-repeatedly, and despite being repeatedly corrected-about marching for civil rights . He has (correctly!) said that he helped in other ways, but he did not march; that didn't stop him from claiming he did and inviting people to \"remember\" those brave actions with him. Why would someone do this?\n\nOne answer might help explain Biden's appeal today. In certain environments, and contemporary politics has become one of them, lies and mistakes become love tests: If you mess up enough for long enough, while convincing people you're on their side, plenty of folks will come to find your mistakes not just negligible but charming. They're proof of your humanity.\n\nThe plagiarism cost Biden in his 1988 run, back when he was still closer to his wunderkind origins (the lying about marching didn't seem to hurt him, though). But neither the plagiarism nor his other statements seem likely to cost him much now. For one, it will take a lot to undo Biden's decade-old recasting as a wacky, spontaneous, white-haired foil to Obama's professionalism, youth, and polish. He became a principle of not just levity but messiness that people found personally appealing. For another, Trump is so boorish and dishonest that many voters struggle with what standards, if any, are even worth maintaining anymore. It disturbed people in 2007 when Biden described his then-rival Barack Obama as \"the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,\" but the incumbent is a champion of birtherism. Voters don't seem to have arrived at anything like a clear consensus on what compromises to make.\n\nIt's always a challenge figuring out which parts of a politician's history are worth attending to when they've been around for as long as Biden has. His positions have evolved on a number of issues, and voters are inclined to credit candidates for apparent progress. Biden went from voting for the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 to defending gay rights in 2012. He supported the invasion in Iraq, then called it a mistake. He initially (in 1973) said he believed Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided-and repeatedly (in 1977 and again in 1981) voted against allowing federal funds to pay for abortions for women in cases of rape or incest, bragging to supporters in 1994 that he'd done so \"on no fewer than 50 occasions.\" But far from leading the fight, his progress has been grudging and reluctant. Those hoping Biden's present position on women's rights would put more distance between Biden then and Biden now might be less disappointed than confused: Biden told an ACLU member in early May that he supported repealing the Hyde Amendment . Then his campaign said he'd \"misheard.\" Last Wednesday his campaign confirmed that in fact he still supported the Hyde Amendment. This Thursday, he said he no longer did .\n\nAny politician with a record as long as Biden's has to tell this \"evolution\" story convincingly and well. Biden's success on this score is spotty. His appeal despite that makes it interesting. In a weird way, his frankness about his self-contradictions-\"I make no apologies for my last position. I make no apologies for what I'm about to say,\" he said Thursday as he reversed himself on the Hyde Amendment-bestows upon him a kind of flexibility that allows him to claim (for example) that he won't accept donations from corporate lobbyists , and then kick off his campaign with a fundraiser held at the home of the head of lobbying for Comcast .\n\nPeople support Biden for a lot of reasons (a desire to beat Trump counts). But a significant part of his success has been getting much of the public to see his flaws and lies as lovable, well-meaning, and proof of his honesty (which these days means something more like \"authenticity\"). This is prime political terrain very few figures manage to carve out. In the authoritative book about the 1988 campaign, What It Takes , for instance, Richard Ben Cramer gives a remarkably positive spin to Biden's lies about marching for civil rights while his advisers (who had warned him to stop) look on. \"Still, this was also the reason they were working for Biden,\" he writes, \"for the abandon with which he stretched himself (and not just by exaggeration) to touch a thousand lives a day ... for the talent, extravagant effort, the generosity of spirit that made every event with Biden a festival of inclusion.\"\n\nIt is not \"generosity of spirit\" to lie about your past and your service and your bravery so a crowd will like you. Some might call that narcissistic and self-serving. I'd argue, then, that the generosity here lies more with the audience (Cramer included), who seems willing to interpret Biden's stretching the truth as Biden stretching himself. To hear Cramer tell it, lying to make yourself look better is proof of graciousness and warmth toward those whose admiration you crave (and whose votes you need). A selfish act becomes a noble accommodation.\n\nBut there's no denying that this is the kind of generous reading Biden inspires. People really, truly like Biden. They believe he means well, however many times he messes up. They want to give him the benefit of the doubt- that's just Joe! -and many think being a \"gut politician\" (as he calls himself) is the only real strategic counterweight to Trump. This is a real and impressive power. If the erratic and famously \"electable\" front-runner has one enduring advantage, it's a long history of branding himself as undisciplined and constantly evolving (but not too quickly). The latter makes him hard to pin down. The former lowers expectations. The combo makes him more immune to scandal than most. (And it tantalizes his more progressive supporters with the hope that he might be \"better\" on whatever issue they care about than he used to be.) It also means, of course, that he can give a sober statement about respecting the personal space of women and then turn it into a punchline at every campaign stop.\n\nIt's also not just possible but proven that America holds powerful men with established patterns of misbehavior to lower standards. There is a certain kind of person who acclimates those around him to his defects (or tantrums, or improprieties). The extreme version of this is sometimes described with the \"missing stair\" theory-the idea being that there are people who present as clear and obvious a challenge as a missing stair in a house. Instead of fixing it, everyone adjusts. People step over it until the missing stair becomes less an obvious problem than something each individual feels responsibility to work around. After enough time, the people who object to the missing stair are the odd ones. This is just the way he is, and confronting it won't do any good. When his Kennedy remarks were called out, Biden said they'd been typed for him. Questioned about what he meant by calling Obama \"bright,\" \"clean,\" and \"articulate,\" Biden said others knew perfectly well what he meant. Asked to apologize to Anita Hill, Biden passively regretted what had happened to her. In his younger days, once challenged on his academic history, he attacked his interlocutor by saying, \"I probably have a much higher IQ than you do, I suspect.\"\n\nThose tactics may sound familiar . Joe had an unfortunate week, but his \"gaffes\" are so firmly a part of his identity now that the absence of mistakes gets reported on in the New York Times . These errors aren't likely to do him much harm-gaffes never do-and so Biden's supporters are probably right: Given this skill set, he may indeed be the person best equipped to run against the man who has almost perfectly programmed his public to preemptively overlook lies and mistakes while arguing he deserves the most powerful position on earth.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "What's Inside the Controversial 1994 Crime Bill That's Plaguing Hillary Clinton on the Campaign Trail\n\nFormer President Clinton signed the multi-pronged bill into law.\n\n&#151; -- One of the latest flash points in the Democratic presidential race is a crime bill signed into law more than two decades ago.\n\nThe Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, passed by then-President Bill Clinton in 1994, has caused outbursts from protesters and is bringing his time in the White House under scrutiny. Last week, Clinton clashed with protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement, defending the tough law.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the controversial law and why it's the subject of criticism now:\n\nThe Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act was passed with bi-partisan support in April 1994 and was originally written by another familiar politician: then-Sen. Joe Biden .\n\nThe crime bill was one of the largest in the country's history, with multiple initiatives to fight crime, and it came at a time when violent crime was at staggering heights. According to the the FBI , there were more than 713 violent crimes per 100,000 people in 1994. In context, that is the second-highest annual crime rate from 1993 until 2012, with 1993 having the highest violent crime rate of 747 per 100,000 residents.\n\nNotably, the law helped pay for new federal prisons if states agreed to force offenders to serve 85 percent of their sentence as opposed to allowing them out early on parole.\n\n\"It looked on the books as if this was going to more than double the prison sentence lengths of offenders nationwide if the individual states would go for it,\" Professor Candace McCoy from John Jay College's Doctoral Program in Criminal Justice told ABC News.\n\n\"In actual impact, that law was considerably less severe than it appeared and that's because many states didn't go for it. The ones that did, such as New Jersey ... they applied it only to violent offenders. Well, most of those people were going to prison for very long times anyway so it increased the sentence lengths sometimes, but not much. They virtually abolished parole,\" she added.\n\nOne of the other more visible initiatives was the hiring of 100,000 more police officers across the country by paying for two-thirds of the new officers' salaries in participating cities.\n\n\"The idea behind this whole thing is it enabled the police to do their job more effectively,\" said former NYPD Sgt. Joe Giacalone, who joined the force in 1992.\n\nThere were many other facets to the law, but some of the most notable others are the creation of the federal \"three strikes\" rule, which mandated life in prison for people who had committed three violent felonies; the assault weapons ban, which stopped the manufacture of 19 semi-automatic firearms; and the removal of education grants for inmates.\n\nThe law is largely criticized for causing incarceration rates to spike, particularly for minorities. But experts differ on the direct impact the crime bill had on mass incarceration.\n\nGiacalone said that since so much focus was being paid to the crack epidemic at the time, one of polices' biggest targets were crack dealers, who were hit with longer sentences and higher fines. He conceded that the bill did cause prison rates to \"balloon,\" noting \"for every action of course there's a reaction.\"\n\nBut McCoy disagreed that the jump in mass incarceration was caused by the crime bill.\n\n\"It is not directly responsible for the worst excesses of mass incarceration or police militarization. It's simply not,\" McCoy said. \"The mass incarceration came from the states, and Bill Clinton got on their bandwagon.\"\n\nThe impacts of the 1994 bill have been discussed at different points during the 2016 race, and Hillary Clinton told the New York Daily News editorial board last week that she believes mass incarceration was an unintended consequence.\n\n\"That was not as apparent at the time, but part of being a responsible decision maker is to keep track of what's happening.... And now I think it's clear there were some consequences that we do have to address,\" she told the paper's editorial board.\n\nLast summer, former President Clinton made a similar statement, noting that he \"signed a bill that made the problem worse.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Biden's key role in 1994 crime bill attacked by both Trump and Democrats\n\nThe former vice president argues it didn't result in \"mass incarcerations.\"\n\nEarlier this month, standing in the rain before a crowd of Granite State voters at a house party in Nashua, New Hampshire, former Vice President Joe Biden defended his role in a signature piece of legislation he shepherded through Congress more than two decades ago -- a sweeping, bipartisan 1994 crime bill that has turned into a looming hurdle in his presidential bid -- and a target for President Donald Trump.\n\nThe key complaint Trump has seized on -- voiced by African American critics and some of Biden's 2020 Democratic rivals -- is that the measure led to mass incarceration of blacks, especially young men.\n\nIn fact, across the country the incarceration rates in the years leading up to the passage of the 1994 crime bill had already begun to see a steep rise beginning in the early 1980s, according to the Sentencing Project and data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nStill, it's a claim Biden has already attempted to debunk on the campaign trail.\n\n\"Folks, let's get something straight,\" he told the crowd in Nashua on May 14. \"This idea that the crime bill generated mass incarceration, it did not generate mass incarceration.\"\n\nThis latest flash point in the Democratic presidential race, formally known as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, was signed by President Bill Clinton in 1994 and was a comprehensive response to the country's rising violent crime rate.\n\nProvisions in the law included paying for new federal prisons if states agreed to force offenders to serve 85% of their sentence as opposed to allowing them out early on parole; providing tens of billions of dollars to put 100,000 more police officers on the streets by paying for two-thirds of the new officers' salaries in participating cities; instituting a federal \"three strikes\" rule, which mandated harsher sentences up to life in prison for defendants who had committed a third felony after being convicted in state or federal court of two previous felonies -- at least one of which was serious or violent; and funding crime prevention programs. Other notable components included: an assault weapons ban, the removal of education grants for inmates, and the Violence Against Women Act.\n\nThe \"three strikes\" rule -- implemented in varying degrees by states as well, California being the harshest -- was among the most controversial aspects of the law because it mandated lengthy prison terms even for less serious crimes if the defendant was a repeat offender.\n\nThe former Delaware senator has said that while he \"had to accept\" President Clinton's \"three strikes\" rule, mass incarceration was a result of \"states setting mandatory sentences.\"\n\nBut Biden's pivotal role in getting the bill passed, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, is facing new scrutiny.\n\n\"Anyone associated with the 1994 crime bill will not have a chance of being elected,\" Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. \"In particular, African Americans will not be able to vote for you. I, on the other hand, was responsible for Criminal Justice Reform, which had tremendous support, and helped fix the bad 1994 Bill!\"\n\n\"Super Predator was the term associated with the 1994 Crime Bill that Sleepy Joe Biden was so heavily involved in passing. That was a dark period in American History, but has Sleepy Joe apologized? No,\" he said in another tweet, although it was then-first lady Hillary Clinton in 1994, not Biden, who used the term \"superpredator\" in support of the law.\n\nDespite his tweets, Trump himself has used similar language. In his 2000 book \"The America We Deserve,\" the then-New York real estate magnate referred to perpetrators as \"predators.\"\n\nTrump appears to be hoping to drive a wedge between Biden and African American voters, whom the former vice president needs to clinch the Democratic nomination and take on the incumbent president.\n\nBut with more than 500 days until Election Day and months of campaigning in the early voting states ahead, a more immediate concern for Biden would seem to be the broader potential disapproval of his past record by voters from within his own party -- after a slate of other Democratic presidential candidates openly disparaged the 1994 crime bill in recent weeks.\n\n\"That 1994 crime bill, it did contribute to mass incarceration in our country,\" California Sen. Kamala Harris said earlier this month at a campaign stop in New Hampshire, contradicting Biden's New Hampshire comments, according to the Associated Press . \"It encouraged and was the first time that we had a federal three strikes law,\" Harris said. \"It funded the building of more prisons in the states. So, I disagree, sadly.\"\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio, on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday, also blamed the bill for the upswing.\n\n\"That crime bill was one of the foundations of mass incarceration in a very painful era in our nation's history,\" he said.\n\n\"The (former) vice president and anyone else has to be accountable for every vote they take and what's on their record, and I think that was a huge mistake,\" he added.\n\n\"I think the incarceration did so much harm that I would think that even those who were behind the '94 crime bill - or at least many of them - would do it differently if they had a chance to do it again,\" Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, told the Washington Post on May 23.\n\n\"As President of the United States, your job is to pursue justice and what we see right now is so many folks suffering,\" New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said during a CNN town hall on March 27. \"I passed a comprehensive criminal justice reform bill, with other senators on both sides of the aisle, the first time since those horrible crime bills back in the 1990s, passed this legislation working across the aisle to move forward.\"\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, another 2020 competitor who sits in second place in most polls of the Democratic primary so far, also voted for the 1994 bill. He is the only other candidate among the current filed of Democratic hopefuls who was serving in Congress at the time.\n\nThe crime bill was the highest-profile piece of legislation confronting violence during the tough on crime era.\n\nIn the years since the bill became law, the incarceration rate in the United States has reached new record-breaking highs: from 1991 to 1998, the rate of incarceration rose from 313 to 461, per 100,000 population, an increase of 47% despite a decreasing crime rate, according to a report by the Sentencing Project.\n\nThe law, criminal justice reformers now say, perpetuated a false narrative that \"locking up and throwing away the key\" would undercut crime. It instead, continued an upward trajectory of incarceration.\n\n\"Mass incarceration did not start with a '94 crime bill, the country was on an upward trajectory,\" Kara Gotsch, Director of Strategic Initiatives at the Sentencing Project told ABC News. \"Criminal Justice reformers, point to it, in particular, because of the incentives it provided to states through financial incentives to build more prisons if they implemented truth and sentencing policies.\"\n\n\"Certainly the crime bill, both symbolically and practically, did contribute to mass incarceration and I absolutely agree that Joe Biden had a big role in the passage of that bill,\" she continued. \"He articulated very much the rhetoric, the tough on crime rhetoric of the day, and he is responsible for perpetuating that false narrative of why that locking up and throwing away the key was somehow going to save, you know, stop drug use and, and prevent crime.\"\n\nDespite Biden appearing to suggest that states held most of the responsibility for mass incarceration in New Hampshire, since the 1994 crime bill he helped author only applied to federal law and not at the state level, the tough on crime rhetoric espoused by top leaders of government at the time trickled down to the states and influenced their policymaking with federal funding.\n\n\"There's blame to go around to everyone. The federal government, in the 1990s, certainly, under the Clinton administration, really prioritized the message of tough on crime,\" Gotsch said. \"We had many years, many presidential administrations calling for tough on crime ... all our money went into police, putting more police on the ground, increasing the number of arrests, putting more communities of color, in jeopardy and putting them behind bars ... They have a much louder microphone than the people who are at and the state local level so they do share in the blame for mass incarceration.\"\n\n\"Federal policymakers helped contribute to the growth of mass incarceration, using funding to encourage states to increase arrests, prosecution, and imprisonment. The 1994 Crime Bill, for example, incentivized states to lengthen prison sentences and build prisons,\" Inimai Chettiar and Priya Raghavan, both at the Brennan Center for Justice, wrote in a report published earlier this month .\n\nABC News' Molly Nagle, Meghan Keneally, Chris Donovan and Meridith McGraw contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Mayor Bill de Blasio criticizes Joe Biden on 1994 crime bill\n\nBill de Blasio called 1994 crime bill \"a mistake.\"\n\nNEW YORK -- New York Mayor and Democratic presidential hopeful Bill de Blasio is joining the chorus of voices calling out and criticizing the primary's current front-runner, former Vice President Joe Biden , over his continued defense of the 1994 crime bill.\n\n\"We need a nominee in the Democratic Party that understands the crime bill was a mistake -- and is ready to get away from the era of mass incarceration and go in an entirely different direction,\" de Blasio told ABC News in an interview at Gracie Mansion.\n\nThe Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, often dubbed \"the 1994 crime bill,\" was signed into law by President Bill Clinton and aimed to curb spiking crime rates around the country. Biden voted for it, and, as the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman at the time, played a significant role in passing it.\n\nNow, many Democratic 2020 candidates and even President Donald Trump are taking aim at the former vice president, pointing to the bill as a cause for the mass incarceration of young black men.\n\n\"It clearly ultimately led to disparate treatment between white people and people of color right there. That's not American. That's not fair,\" said de Blasio. \"Anyone who voted for that bill has to own up to it and has to acknowledge that we need to go an entirely different direction.\"\n\nAcross the country, the incarceration rates in the years leading up to the passage of the 1994 crime bill had already begun to see a steep rise, beginning in the early 1980s, according to the Sentencing Project and data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics.\n\nWhen asked about that data, the mayor said, \"The crime bill kept it going and made it worse.\"\n\nDe Blasio attributed a drop in crime rates since the 1990s to smarter policing that involved communities, not methods instituted by the crime bill.\n\nProvisions in the 1994 crime bill included paying for new federal prisons if states agreed to force offenders to serve 85% of their sentence as opposed to allowing them out early on parole; providing tens of billions of dollars to put 100,000 more police officers on the streets by paying for two-thirds of the new officers' salaries in participating cities; instituting a federal \"three strikes\" rule, which mandated harsher sentences of up to life in prison for defendants who had committed a third felony after being convicted in state or federal court of two previous felonies, at least one of which was serious or violent; and funding crime prevention programs. Other notable components included an assault weapons ban, the removal of education grants for inmates and the Violence Against Women Act.\n\nThe \"three strikes\" rule -- implemented in varying degrees by states, with California being the harshest -- was among the most controversial aspects of the law because it mandated lengthy prison terms for less serious crimes if the defendant was a repeat offender.\n\nThe former Delaware senator has said that while he \"had to accept\" Clinton's \"three strikes\" rule, mass incarceration was a result of \"states setting mandatory sentences.\"\n\nDe Blasio's criticism comes after a New York Times column claimed Biden should be proud of his support for the 1994 bill. The column called \"disproportionate consequences for racial minorities\" a side effect of the bill but said it made cities, like New York safer -- an idea de Blasio rails against.\n\nBiden has defended his support of the bill on the 2020 campaign trail.\n\n\"Folks, let's get something straight,\" Biden said at a Nashua, New Hampshire, campaign stop on May 14. \"This idea that the crime bill generated mass incarceration, it did not generate mass incarceration.\"\n\nDe Blasio wants to take his case to voters but hasn't met the Democratic National Convention's qualifications to claim a spot on the debate stages.\n\n\"I've got a lot to say ... about what has been achieved here in the biggest, toughest city in the country and all the things that we could do to address the needs of working people,\" de Blasio said. \"My concern is, we'd better not cut off real debate and real competition and undercut the diversity of the field of options that we have right now.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Biden defends about face on crime law he helped create\n\nCritics say his crime bill helped lay the groundwork for mass incarceration.\n\nOn the heels of his appearance before the NAACP Convention in Detroit former Vice President Joe Biden hit back at criticism of his criminal justice plan -- proposals that, in some ways, would reverse measures he helped put in place -- by attacking the record of one of his most dogged critics, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey.\n\n\"Look at the mayor's record in Newark,\" Biden challenged reporters, pointing to a federal investigation over the Newark Police Department's use of stop-and-frisk during Booker's time as mayor of the city.\n\nEarlier in the day, Booker had taken his criticisms of Biden's plan a step further and called the former vice president \"an architect of mass incarceration.\"\n\nThe report, which Biden brought up when asked about Booker's earlier comments, found 75% of stops by the police in Newark lacked legal basis, among other issues. Booker and the Newark Police Department cooperated with the investigation and agreed to reforms, according to the Justice Department.\n\nBooker and Biden's back-and-forth centers on Biden's support of the 1994 crime bill, which critics say helped lay the groundwork for mass incarceration.\n\nTheir comments have also set the stage for the Democratic debates next week, when Booker and Biden will appear on the same night and are likely to address their differences head on. In a preview of that confrontation, Biden's team has sought to undermine Booker's legacy as mayor of Newark while Booker's team continues to criticize Biden for efforts in the U.S. during his 40-year career that they say ultimately led to mass incarceration.\n\n\"I'm anxious to have a debate with Senator Booker,\" Biden told reporters Wednesday at a campaign stop in Dearborn, Mich., after the NAACP forum, adding that the two candidates will have \"time to talk about it\" then.\n\nBiden's plan focuses on preventing crime, eliminating racial disparities and providing second chances for those who have had contact with the criminal justice system. But his pivotal role in getting the 1994 crime bill passed while Senate Judiciary chairman complicates his vision for the future.\n\nAnd while Biden joins fellow presidential hopefuls like Booker, South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and others in releasing criminal justice plans, his calls for the end of mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug crimes -- including some he helped put in place -- will continue to face heightened scrutiny.\n\nThe 1994 crime bill gets a lot of attention because \"it was the largest crime bill ever passed,\" said Lauren-Brooke Eisen, a senior fellow in the Brennan Center's Justice Program, and the program's acting director. \"There's a lot of focus on the sentencing aspect of the bill\" because it \"earmarked funds for states that adopted punitive sentencing laws which required individuals convicted of certain crimes to serve at least 85% of their sentences.\"\n\nEisen noted, that in 2019, a number of lawmakers and candidates are focused on \"addressing the need to significantly reduce the number of people behind bars.\"\n\nThe Biden plan calls for treatment for those who suffer from addiction rather than incarceration, increase federal funding for drug courts, and an elimination of the disparity in how crack users and cocaine users are charged and sentenced -- also enacted while Biden served on the Judiciary Committee.\n\nBiden has expressed regret over supporting the past policy, calling it a \"mistake\" earlier this year, and said in remarks during a National Action Committee Martin Luther King Jr. breakfast in January. that while he hasn't always gotten it right, he's always tried.\n\nOn marijuana, Biden - like many other candidates - will decriminalize the drug. The former vice president will also automatically expunge records for those who have been convicted of marijuana-related offenses . Unlike some of his presidential opponents, he does not call for the federal legalization of the drug, but rather for it to be made a schedule II drug so more research can be done on its effects.\n\nBiden's plan calls for an end to private prisons, which Eisen says has become a big issue in the 2020 election. According to the Brennan Center, Biden becomes at least the 11th candidate to call for the end of private prisons.\n\nHis plan's focus on juvenile criminal justice reform includes investing $1 billion annually to keep minors from being placed in adult prisons, and expanding after-school programs, community centers and summer jobs funding . The plan provides $20 billion in grants for states that find methods to reduce crime and incarceration, citing a proposal from the Brennan Center.\n\nBiden, like other candidates, would also direct the Department of Housing and Urban Development to only contract with entities open to housing people who who were once incarcerated and are looking for a second chance.\n\nSome of Biden's fellow 2020 Democratic challengers say his plan is too little, too late.\n\n\"Joe Biden had more than 40 years to get this right,\" Booker said in a statement on Tuesday. \"The proud architect of a failed system is not the right person to fix it. The 1994 crime bill accelerated mass incarceration and inflicted immeasurable harm on black, brown and low-income communities. While it's encouraging to see Vice President Biden finally come around to supporting many of the ideas I and others have proposed, his plan falls short of the transforrmative change our broken criminal justice system needs.\"\n\n\"We need a nominee in the Democratic Party that understands the crime bill was a mistake,\" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio told ABC News in May.\n\nAnd, that same month, President Donald Trump tweeted \"Anyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected. In particular, African Americans will not be able to vote for you.\"\n\nBiden has disputed the idea that the crime bill created mass incarceration, saying at a stop on the campaign trail in Nashua, New Hampshire, on May 14: \"Folks, let's get something straight. ... This idea that the crime bill generated mass incarceration, it did not generate mass incarceration.\"\n\nStill, senior Biden campaign officials say the former vice president expects continued attacks from his opponents on his record including at this week's NAACP gathering, Urban League forum in Indianapolis and the upcoming second presidential debate.\n\n\"I have a great deal of respect for Vice President Joe Biden, but I disagree with him,\" Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., told reporters in May in Nashua in response to Biden's claims. \"That crime bill - that 1994 crime bill - it did contribute to mass incarceration in our country. It encouraged and was the first time that we had a federal three-strikes law. It funded the building of more prisons in the states.\"\n\nBiden is not the only 2020 candidate to come under fire for their past record with criminal justice. Harris, who has been critical about the nation's high incarceration rates, has also been criticized for her past work as a prosecutor and California's attorney general -- especially for her campaign against truancy as district attorney. Some have criticized the policy as an attempt to criminalize parents whose children missed more than 30 days of schools.\n\nBiden first unveiled some of his criminal justice reform proposals in late June at the South Carolina Democratic Party Convention.\n\nBiden campaign national co-chair Rep. Cedric Richmond said in an interview on CNN Tuesday that \"it's very clear\" that Sen.s Harris and Booker will target crime in the next debate and that Biden will get attacked by his opponents because he is leading the race.\n\nThe next debate takes place on July 30 and 31.\n\nABC News' Averi Harper, Adam Kelsey, Armando Garcia and Justin Gomez contributed to this report\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "The gun legislation Congress has passed and rejected amid mass shootings: Timeline\n\nA bipartisan compromise last year broke a three-decade stalemate.\n\nAfter the latest mass shooting in America -- this time at an outdoor mall in Allen, Texas, on Saturday , in which eight people were killed along with the suspected gunman -- President Joe Biden repeated his call for a ban on assault-style weapons, despite Republican opponents arguing such regulations are misguided and usually unconstitutional.\n\nWashington's current divide on the issue is deeply rooted, tracing back to the mid-1990s, and has been shaped by electoral politics including the Democratic rout in the 1994 midterms that saw them lose the House for the first time in 40 years.\n\nThe last major action from Congress on gun laws was in June 2022 , about a month after the Robb Elementary School massacre in Uvalde, Texas, that killed 19 students and two teachers .\n\nThat compromise, the $13.2 billion Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, was backed by Democrats as well as 15 Senate Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and 14 House Republicans.\n\nBut a weapons ban like the one pushed by Biden has little to no chance of being approved on Capitol Hill, where Republicans have rejected it.\n\nWhile Democratic lawmakers have at various times urged more federal gun reforms -- mostly focused on assault-style or military-grade weapons and munitions and expanding the screening process for who can and cannot have a gun -- Republicans more recently say the focus should be elsewhere, on increasing public security and awareness of mental health and social issues.\n\nStill the shootings continue, with new rounds of legislation often proposed in the wake of the worst killings: in Uvalde and in a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school a decade earlier; and at Columbine High School 13 years before that, among other examples.\n\nHere is a look back at notable pieces of federal gun legislation that either passed or were defeated in Congress.\n\nThe timeline reflects in part how the politics around guns, and the coalitions of politicians focusing on it, have shifted over time -- from anxieties about crime in the '90s that drew across-the-aisle endorsements to major support for gun manufacturers in the early 2000s to outcry about reducing school killings, and beyond.\n\n2022: The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act breaks a nearly 30-year stalemate on Capitol Hill over federal gun laws when it is signed into law in June 2022. \"At a time when it seems impossible to get anything done in Washington, we are doing something consequential,\" Biden says then. The law includes $750 million to help states implement so-called \"red flag\" laws to remove firearms from people deemed to be a danger to themselves or others as well as other violence prevention programs. It also provides funding for a variety of programs aimed at shoring up the nation's mental health apparatus and securing schools. It enhances background checks for gun buyers under the age of 21 and closes what is known as the \"boyfriend loophole\" so individuals in \"serious\" \"dating relationships\" who are convicted of domestic abuse will be prevented from purchasing a gun. But other, tougher restrictions are taken off the table as part of negotiations with conservatives, including raising the minimum age to buy assault-type weapons, mandatory waiting periods for all gun sales and universal background checks.\n\n2021: The House Democratic majority passes two lightly bipartisan measures expanding background checks, despite Republicans reiterating objections on Second Amendment grounds. One bill increases the window for review on a sale from three to 10 business days; the other bill essentially requires background checks on all transactions by barring the sale or transfer of firearms by non-federally licensed entities (closing so-called private loopholes). House Democrats vote to approve the first bill along with two Republicans (and two Democrats voting no). All Democrats except for one along with eight Republicans vote yes on the second bill, which previously passed the House in 2019, also under Democratic control.\n\n2018: Congress passes and President Donald Trump signs into law an incremental boost to the federal background check system for potential gun owners. (The legislation is included as part of a necessary government spending package approved by wide bipartisan margins.)\n\n2017: Trump signs into law a congressional reversal of an Obama-era rule which would have added an estimated 75,000 people to the federal background check system who were receiving Social Security mental disability benefits through a representative. Republican majorities in the House and Senate are joined by a few Democrats -- four in the Senate and and six in the House -- in blocking the impending regulation, which is opposed by both civil liberties and gun rights advocates.\n\n2017: The House Republican majority is joined by six Democrats -- with 14 Republicans opposing, arguing federal overreach -- in backing a measure expanding concealed carry permits across the country via a reciprocity law requiring states to honor permits issued elsewhere. The bill dies in the Senate.\n\n2013-2016: Partially prompted by the Sandy Hook Elementary School and Pulse nightclub killings, Congress takes up and then votes down various measures to expand background checks for sales online and at gun shows and to block people on no-fly and terrorism watch lists from being able to buy firearms. In one representative set of votes, in 2016, Democratic and Republican senators (with Republicans in the majority) each advance two proposals that are blocked along party lines. While some of those measures garner a majority, none get the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster as a potential winning compromise is frayed by differences over tactics and approach. Still, Susan Collins, R-Maine, reiterates hope -- somewhere down the line -- citing \"tremendous interest from both sides of the aisle.\"\n\n2013: A bipartisan group in the Senate fails to approve their own expansion of concealed carry permits across the country, similar to what the House later takes up in 2017 and earlier tries to pass in 2011. Republicans, then in the minority, are joined by 12 Democrats -- many of whom later say they oppose the expansion as the party and its base recommits to messaging around reducing guns and shootings.\n\n2005: Congress' Republican majority is joined by dozens of Democrats in passing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms, signed into law by President George W. Bush. The legislation shields gun manufacturers from legal liability in almost all instances where their firearms are criminally used -- with exceptions for defects in gun design, breach of contract and negligence. (PLCAA has since become a major target of Democratic ire, singled out by President Biden, though such protections are not unheard of for other industries.)\n\n2004: The assault weapons ban signed into law 10 years earlier -- and detailed below -- ends in September 2004 according to a predetermined \"sunset\" date. Ahead of the expiration, congressional Democrats seek either to extend the ban another decade or to broaden it. Then-President George W. Bush also says he supports renewing the restrictions, in what is seen as an unusual break of his White House from the National Rifle Association. The ban, though outlawing 19 kinds of firearms, has some key exceptions that make it controversial among gun control advocates.\n\n1999: Previewing failed efforts to come, Congress votes down legislation to institute background checks and waiting periods for purchases at gun shows.\n\n1994: In what would become the last major piece of federal gun legislation enacted by Congress, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban bars the manufacture and possession of a broad swath of semiautomatic weapons. The provision is included as part of the sweeping 1994 crime bill, shepherded by then-Sen. Biden and signed into law by President Bill Clinton. Gun legislation in this era is politically intertwined with federal efforts to curb crime. While the House narrowly passes the assault ban on its own and then later, successfully, via the overall crime legislation -- in the first case, with most of the Democratic majority being joined by 38 Republicans; later, along with 46 Republicans -- the crime bill is approved overwhelmingly in the Senate, with only two Democrats and two Republicans voting against and one Democrat, North Dakota's Byron L. Dorgan, abstaining. The Senate approves with slimmer margins a reconciled version with the House in late 1994, with seven Republicans joining the Democratic majority. Clinton signs it shortly after. The assault ban includes some exemptions on the outlawed weapons along with a sunset date after 10 years, in what were seen as necessary concessions. Subsequent efforts to reauthorize the ban have failed.\n\n1993: A year before the assault weapon ban, and amid sharp public concern about street-level crime, the House and Senate back the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (named for President Ronald Reagan's press secretary James Brady, who was gravely wounded in Reagan's attempted assassination in 1981). Commonly known as the Brady bill, it institutes background checks for federally licensed sellers and initially imposes a five-day waiting period on sales -- a provision that is later sunset with the launch of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Two-thirds of House Democrats are joined by a third of House Republicans in voting yes on the legislation. Although eight Democratic senators vote no (and one abstains), 16 Senate Republicans approve its passage along with the Democratic majority. President Clinton signs it into law.\n\nABC News' Ben Gittleson, Alexandra Hutzler, Allison Pecorin, Rachel Scott and Trish Turner contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Joe Biden once pushed for more police. Now, he confronts the challenge of police reform\n\nBiden is calling for more funding for community-based policing.\n\nIn 2002, then-Senator Joe Biden wrote an op-ed for the Delaware State News, reacting to an FBI report that the national crime rate was on the rise for the first time in 10 years. Biden cautioned while crime was down in his home state, the country needed to stay alert to the rising rate.\n\n\"What works in the fight against crime? It's simple -- more police on the streets,\" Biden wrote.\n\n\"Put a cop on three of four corners and guess where the crime is going to be committed? On the fourth corner, where the cop isn't. More cops clearly means less crime,\" Biden went on in the op-ed.\n\nEighteen years later, Biden is now the presumptive Democratic nominee, mounting his third run for the presidency in the midst of a nationwide discussion on systemic racism, and urgent calls for extensive reforms to policing following the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis.\n\nWhile Biden has called this \"one of those great inflection points in American history,\" his record on criminal justice, and more than two decades of calls for increasing the number of police on the street are getting a second look, putting his past positions at odds with the conclusions of even some allies.\n\n\"We really do have to get to a point where we agree that the status quo way of thinking about achieving safety is really wrong when it assumes that the best way to achieve more safety is to put more police on the streets,\" Sen. Kamala Harris, a vice presidential contender and former California attorney general said on Good Morning America Tuesday.\n\nBiden's campaign declined to say if the former vice president still believes that increasing the number of police in communities is the way to ensure less crime, instead pointing to his support for a community-based policing approach.\n\nRecently, Biden has also expressed his support for several measures proposed in legislation introduced by congressional Democrats, including a federal ban on police use of chokeholds, requiring racial and religious bias training for officers, and collecting data on police use of force.\n\nThese measures are in addition to Biden's current plan for criminal justice reform, unveiled in July of 2019, which calls for $300 million in funding for the community-oriented policing, including funding for the Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS, program, conditioning grants given through the program on the requirement departments hire police officers that mirror the racial diversity of the community they serve.\n\n\"I've long been a firm believer in the power of community policing - getting cops out of their cruisers and building relationships with the people and the communities they are there to serve and protect,\" Biden wrote in an USA Today op-ed published Wednesday on his plan to address systemic racism in policing, which includes reforms like buying body cameras and adopting a national use of force standard.\n\nAccording to Biden's campaign, at least a portion of the funding that flows to the COPS program would go to hiring new police, but did not provide specifics on how much of the funding would be allocated for that purpose.\n\n\"Those details would have to be worked out in the legislative process, but the funding would likely be used for purposes such as hiring new officers, standing up recruitment programs to ensure officers reflect the diversity of the communities they serve, and training on community-policing strategies,\" Stef Feldman, Biden's Policy Director told ABC News.\n\nBiden's most recent proposal takes a markedly different tone than his 2008 campaign policy, where he proudly touted his work on the \"Biden Crime Bill.\"\n\n\"In the 1990s, the Biden Crime Bill added 100,000 cops to America's streets,\" Biden's 2008 campaign website read, accessed through an internet archive.\n\n\"George Bush's cuts to the program have put America at risk and crime rates are back on the rise...Joe Biden wants to put 50,000 more cops on the street and add 1,000 more FBI agents to address the rise in crime and threats of terrorism,\" Biden's crime policy continued.\n\nBiden has been plagued with questions throughout his third run for the presidency on that measure-- better known as the 1994 crime bill. Despite being proudly touted in his policy proposal in 2008, no mention of the \"Biden\" bill appears on his current website\n\nThe bill, which Biden had a leading role in crafting, encompassed the Violence Against Women Act and a federal assault weapons ban--two largely popular policies with Democrats today.\n\nHowever, Biden and the legislation have faced intense scrutiny from critics who say it had a disproportionate impact on minorities, and contributed to mass incarceration in the United States. While Biden has defended the bill throughout his campaign, he has also acknowledged portions of the bill were a mistake.\n\nThe 1994 bill also created the COPS Program, which initially helped provide grants for hiring new police officers to engage in community policing, and to help train law enforcement officers in \"crime prevention and community policing techniques or developing technologies that support crime prevention strategies,\" according to a summary from the Congressional Research center.\n\nBiden's campaign insists that federal funding will not be provided to police departments that do not enact the needed reforms or a community-based model, but some advocates for changes to the criminal justice system still worry that the threat will not deter localities from ultimately using the resources to simply add more cops to the street.\n\n\"I don't have any confidence, regardless of what Joe Biden suggests he wants to use the money for, that it will be used in that way. Communities, at the end of the day, they're going to make their own decision about how they want to invest those resources. The thought process in a lot of communities is 'We believe in more cops and we want to build more jails.' And that's really troubling,\" Kara Gotsch, the director of strategic initiatives at the Sentencing Project, told ABC News.\n\nSome experts also warn that money that has flowed into the program in recent years, especially during the Trump administration, has not gone towards its purported purpose of promoting community policing in law enforcement.\n\n\"Since the program started, billions of dollars have gone to encourage more policing, and far, far less has gone to more community-minded policing,\" Rachel Harmon the director of the Center for Criminal Justice at the University of Virginia School of Law told ABC News.\n\n\"Any new money to the COPS program should focus on promoting community-based solutions to public safety, and ensuring that departments protect civil rights, minimize harm, hold officers accountable, and allow community input into policing. Otherwise, the money could do more harm than good,\" Harmon argued.\n\nOther experts agree that there has been, and needs to continue to be a shift in the way funding for police departments nationwide is allocated and spent, arguing the funding should emphasize meeting the needs of a community and preparing officers for the myriad of challenges they face on a daily basis, and deemphasize the belief that higher incarceration rates will automatically result in better outcomes.\n\n\"Funding needs to support efforts to reimagine public safety and how to get there by supporting programs that sometimes divert people away from the criminal justice system. But in order for the police to engage in those more productive public safety-oriented outcomes they need strategies on the ground and resources on the ground to utilize,\" said Taryn Merkl, the senior counsel in the Brennan Center's Justice Program and its Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration initiative, and a former Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York.\n\nBiden's continued focus on community policing has coincided with new calls for defunding police departments from some progressive Democrats in favor of shifting funds away from law enforcement budgets to other priorities to promote public safety.\n\n\"No, I don't support defunding the police. I support conditioning federal aid to police based on whether or not they meet certain basic standards of decency and honorableness. And, in fact, are able to demonstrate they can protect the community and everybody in the community,\" Biden told CBS News in an interview earlier this week.\n\nThe former vice president's current policy calls for increases in funding to create partnerships between police departments and social workers, disability advocates and mental health and substance use disorder experts, to give police training to de-escalate situations with individuals without turning violent, which could include having social service providers respond to calls with police officers.\n\nBiden also supports \"funding for public schools, summer programs, and mental health and substance abuse treatment separate from funding for policing,\" according to a Monday statement from campaign spokesperson, Andrew Bates.\n\n\"There, I think, is a move to narrow the scope of what police officers should be focused on and really narrow it to focus really on pure law enforcement, when people are committing acts of violence and things of that nature,\" Jason C. Johnson, the president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund, and former deputy commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department from 2016-2018 told ABC News.\n\n\"I think that actually kind of works pretty well in community policing because [that's] what the community really wants. They want a social worker to respond to the problem of homelessness or addiction, not necessarily a police officer.\"\n\nThe reform conversation is also taking place amid a tectonic shift in the public's attitude on race and policing, borne out in recent polling that has been conducted in the weeks following Floyd's death.\n\nAn ABC News/Ipsos poll conducted last week showed a more than 30-point increase in the belief that recent events reflect a broader issue over racial injustice compared to an ABC News/Washington Post poll from December 2014 that was conducted four months after the shooting of Michael Brown , an 18-year black man, by a white cop, and five months after the death of Eric Garner , a black man, who died after being put in a chokehold by a white officer.\n\nSimilarly, a Washington Post poll conducted with the Schar School of Public Policy and Government at George Mason University showed a 26-point increase among American adults in the attitude that police killings of black Americans are part of a broder problem as opposed to isolated incidents, compared to the same 2014 polling.\n\nIn the wake of the deaths of Garner and Brown, Biden touted the community-based policing he still supports today as a way to ease tensions between police and minority communities, and advocates, even those who still remain skeptical of his dedication to major criminal justice reform, do credit Biden with a slow but steady evolution of his thinking on the issue.\n\n\"He has certainly evolved on criminal justice issues, and started evolving a long time ago. I don't want to suggest that he is sort of the champion for criminal justice reform, but I think he understood. He worked on crack reform. He had the first senate bill to equalize crack and powder sentences,\" Gotsch said, crediting Biden for leveraging his relationships with the law enforcement community in 2010 to pass sentencing reform for certain drug-related offenses.\n\n\"It was because of him, at the end of the day, that the Fair Sentencing Act passed, which was crack reform. Because he called in his favors with law enforcement and he said, 'I need you not to oppose this. We're getting this done. It's really important.' They didn't oppose it, and law enforcement traditionally is our biggest obstacle to advancing criminal justice reform.\"\n\nDuring Biden's time as vice president, the White House also placed a strong emphasis on Department of Justice pattern-or-practice investigations to look into systemic police misconduct in local law enforcement agencies and build trust between communities and police -- a tool that has been largely abandoned by the Trump administration, and one Biden's policy vows to resume.\n\nThe broader arc in the conversation around criminal justice and police reform in the country is one the Democratic Party writ large is grappling with.\n\nThe 1994 bill that has been the center of considerable criticism was passed with bipartisan support, and had the backing of several Democrats that now occupy the highest echelons of party leadership like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., House Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C., Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D, N.Y., and progressive icon Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., all of whom voted yes on the legislation.\n\nThe change in the willingness on the part of some Democrats to embrace efforts to reform the nation's criminal justice system is the result of a confluence of technological, electoral and generational factors, experts say.\n\n\"One thing that's apparent is the ubiquity of video cameras. Cell phone cameras have been recording things that prior to the revolution in video recording and cell phones would have been just a 'he said, he said,' assuming that one of the persons is still alive to testify as to what happened,\" Darrell Miller, a professor at the Duke University School of Law, told ABC News.\n\nThe overall decrease in violent crime, which has fallen 51% between 1993 and 2018 according to data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), has also likely lessened the worry for some Democrats in being labeled as \"soft on crime\" Miller said.\n\nLastly, the rise of a younger generation, more engaged on social issues and largely at the forefront of recent protests, has pushed Democrats, and Biden, to a place where embracing certain criminal justice reform policies is no longer seen as a significant political liability.\n\n\"The fact that people in the Millennial generation and Gen Z are really plugged in to social issues...has really changed the nature of the conversation about criminal justice reform and actually made it possible for Democrats to embrace reform without being frightened away, that their suggestions are going to be labeled as soft on crime as opposed to really wanting genuine, equitable reform of our criminal justice system,\" Miller said.\n\n\"The socio-economic and criminal justice environment is different in 2020 than it was in 1994. Like a good politician, but also like a good policy thinker, [Biden] knows that when times change, policy needs to change.\"\n\nBut while Biden may be shifting his own policy prescriptions, proponents of more fundamental reforms say he still must address his long record on criminal justice in a way that reflects a true understanding of the new political dynamics.\n\nDuring a town hall with NAACP Wednesday night, Biden said that questions about his record, and involvement with the 1994 crime bill are \"legitimate,\" but a tense exchange surrounding the suggestion that Biden may struggle to win over young voters due to that record put a fine point on the concern.\n\n\"The vice president has to, at some point, address his own record. And he's going to have to address it with some new thinking in terms of remedies to what the largest criticism of him has been, which is the role that he played in the Crime Bill of '94. He has to address that, and leaning on folks who can help him to arrive at a set of policy solutions that correct the major problems of that ill, and also get us to a very different place in terms of police reform,\" Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, a political organization that aims to boost black candidates seeking public office, told ABC News.\n\nBiden's campaign insists that the former vice president hears the concerns and shares the goal of addressing the systemic racism that exists within law enforcement.\n\n\"While they do not agree on all of the same strategies, Vice President Biden and these activists share the same goal: reduce incarceration - especially the fact that too many African American and Latino people are incarcerated - while also improving public safety,\" Feldman said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Bernie Sanders of \"airbrushing history\" by criticizing the 1994 crime bill, legislation enacted by former President Bill Clinton , who engaged in a heated exchange with protesters over its impact on the African-American community last week.\n\nSanders called on the former president to apologize after the incident, which took place earlier this week at a Clinton campaign event in Philadelphia.

I voted for the '94 crime bill,\" Podesta said on ABC's \"This Week With George Stephanopoulos .\" \"I think he's airbrushing history.\"\n\nThe protesters who confronted President Clinton this week were holding signs that read, \"Black youth are not super predators,\" referring to Hillary Clinton's use of the term to describe gang members in a 1996 speech. Clinton reacted by defending his wife's choice of words.\n\n\"I don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack, sent them out onto the street to murder other African-American children,\" he said to the protesters. \"Maybe you thought they were good citizens. She didn't.\"\n\n\"You are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter,\" he continued. \"Tell the truth. You are defending the people who cause young people to go out and take guns.\"\n\nFollowing the exchange, Sanders said President Clinton should apologize to the protesters -- something he reiterated during his own interview Sunday on \"This Week.\"\n\n\"I think we all knew back then what that language meant,\" Sanders said. \"That was referring to young blacks, and I don't think in this country elected officials or leaders should be using that type of terminology.\"\n\nBill Clinton has not apologized, but addressed the confrontation at a campaign event the following day.\n\n\"I did something yesterday in Philadelphia. I almost want to apologize for it,\" he said. \"I want to use it as an example of the danger threatening our country because the founders set this country up so that we could keep growing and being bigger and including more people.\"\n\nWhen pressed on whether President Clinton should apologize, Podesta added, \"I think the president got a little hot, but I think that the charges are misled. I think what the president has done is said there were unintended consequences of the crime bill, that he regrets that, that we need to move on, we need criminal justice reform.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Fact-checking Biden's claim the '94 crime bill didn't cause mass incarceration\n\nDuring a campaign event in Nashua, New Hampshire on Tuesday, Democratic presidential frontrunner Joe Biden was asked about the 1994 crime bill he helped write as a Senator from Delaware. The question posed to Biden concerned the impact the bill had on mass incarceration rates, particularly among minority communities living in poverty, and what he might do to alleviate those effects.\n\n\"Folks, let's get something straight,\" Biden replied before defending the 1994 crime bill. \"This idea that the crime bill generated mass incarceration-it did not generate mass incarceration.\"\n\nFacts first: Following passage of the 1994 crime bill, incarceration rates in the US continued to rise for more than a decade. Experts however say it's hard to determine how much of this increase came as a result of the 1994 bill, since incarceration rates had been steadily rising since the early 1970s.\n\nFrom 1973 to 2009, the incarceration rate in the US more than quadrupled, from 161 people to 767 per 100,000 nationwide, according to a study by the National Research Council. It's hard to pin that trend on one particular piece of legislation.\n\n\"No one bill created mass incarceration,\" Wanda Bertram, communications strategist at the Prison Policy Initiative said Tuesday, noting that the 1994 crime bill was one part of the overall \"tough on crime\" movement that contributed to the four decade rise in the US prison population.\n\nOne of the largest crime bills ever passed, 1994's Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act strengthened law enforcement across the country, providing federal money for new cops and prisons, as well as tightening up federal sentencing guidelines. It included a federal \"three strike\" provision mandating life imprisonment for certain felons convicted of violent crimes, and expanded the death penalty to include 60 additional crimes. The bill also included a ban on 18 different types of semiautomatic assault weapons for the next decade.\n\nAt the Nashua event on Tuesday, Biden argued that federal prisoners make up a small share of the total prison population in the US - which is true. Federal prisoners account for roughly 10% of the total number of people incarcerated in the US.\n\nThe point Biden appeared to be making was that the 1994 bill couldn't have created or greatly attributed to mass incarceration, since it only applied to violations of federal law, not state crimes.\n\nBut that misses the broader impact that federal policy can have on the way that states incarcerate, including the influence of federal money. As a report from the Brennan Center notes, the 1994 crime bill \"provided funding for 100,000 new police officers and $14 billion in grants for community-oriented policing, for example.\"\n\n\"It is fair to say that the trajectory of increased incarceration had already begun before the 1994 crime bill,\" Kara Gotsch, director of strategic initiatives at the Sentencing Project, told CNN Tuesday before noting that the way Congress and the President \"influence state policy is through money.\"\n\nThe 1994 crime bill tried to do just that in offering grants for new prisons to states who imposed truth-in-sentencing (TIS) policies, which impose mandatory minimums for time served.\n\nInitially, the crime bill required states to pass laws mandating violent offenders serve at least 85% of their sentence before those states could receive TIS grant funds.\n\nEven still, the influence of these federal funds shouldn't be overstated. The data is murky on how much the federal grants influenced how states make decisions on sentencing policy.\n\nFor example, a study from the Urban Institute found that out of the 16 states that changed their TIS laws following the 1994 crime bill and that qualified for federal TIS funding, \"the changes were often influenced more by ongoing state reform processes rather than the federal incentive grant program.\"\n\nThe study says that states were already imposing their own minimum sentencing laws before the 1994 crime bill, and at most the bill \"may have contributed to modest changes in sentencing structure\" for a small number of states.\n\n\"The impact was as much rhetorical,\" said Bertram \"as it was a bill that increased the number of people in prison.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Biden defends crime bill amid criticism from Democratic foes and Trump\n\nJoe Biden is defending what many Democrats see as all but indefensible: the 1994 crime bill .\n\nAt virtually every campaign stop, the former vice president fields questions about the consequences of the measure, which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton 25 years ago and is now a potential weight around Biden's 2020 presidential bid. It's the starkest example of how a signature piece of his legislation, which most Democrats supported at the time, is viewed in a far different light today.\n\nInside Biden's camp, some aides believe he must do more to accept the consequences of the law, as Clinton and many supporters of the bill have done. But Biden has been insistent on defending what he believes were good portions of the bill that led to a drop in crime across the country.\n\nRelated article Fact-checking Biden's claim the '94 crime bill didn't cause mass incarceration\n\nAsked about prison reform this week in New Hampshire, Biden brought up the crime bill. He told the audience member who asked about prison reform \"you've been conditioned to say\" that the 1994 legislation \"is a bad bill.\"\n\nHe said there is \"only one provision in there that had to do with mandatory sentences that I opposed. And that was a thing called the 'three strikes and you're out,' which I thought was a mistake. But had a lot of the good things in the bill.\"\n\nAs he takes questions from voters, it often takes Biden several minutes to explain the provisions in the bill, insisting it did not lead to mass incarceration.\n\n\"This idea that the crime bill generated mass incarceration - it did not generate mass incarceration,\" Biden said in an earlier swing through New Hampshire in May.\n\nSeveral of his rivals have rushed to disagree, teeing up a likely conflict at the first Democratic debate in just three weeks.\n\n\"That 1994 crime bill - it did contribute to mass incarceration in our country,\" California Sen. Kamala Harris said recently. \"It encouraged and was the first time that we had a federal three-strikes law. It funded the building of more prisons in the states.\"\n\n\"That bill was awful,\" New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said last week in an interview with the Huffington Post - after saying, \"I love Joe Biden.\"\n\n\"Good people signed on to that bill. People make mistakes,\" Booker said. \"But let's hold them to that. That crime bill was shameful, what it did to black and brown communities like mine (and) low-income communities from Appalachia to rural Iowa. It was a bad bill.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump is also using the issue to mount an attack against Biden that appears more likely to prove damaging in the Democratic primary than in the general election.\n\n\"Anyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected. In particular, African Americans will not be able to vote for you. I, on the other hand, was responsible for Criminal Justice Reform, which had tremendous support, & helped fix the bad 1994 Bill!\" Trump tweeted in late May.\n\nThe President is unlikely to win significant support from black voters in 2020 given his own past actions - including leading the false birtherism conspiracy theory against former President Barack Obama and taking out a full-page newspaper ad in 1989 calling for the execution of the \"Central Park Five,\" black teenagers who were wrongfully convicted of a brutal rape but later exonerated.\n\nBut his focus on the crime bill could increase attention on an issue with the potential to drive a wedge between Biden and black voters; polls have shown that bloc is his most significant base of support in the 2020 Democratic nominating contest - particularly in South Carolina, an early-voting state where the majority of the Democratic electorate is African American.\n\nRelated article CNN Poll: Biden continues to lead crowded Democratic field\n\nThe bill, formally known as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, is now roundly criticized by nearly all Democrats and some Republicans and blamed for locking up a generation of non-violent offenders.\n\nBut it passed in 1994 as a compromise. It gained support from most members of the Congressional Black Caucus as well as several big-city black mayors and clergy leaders who were alarmed at the soaring crime rates.\n\nBiden, then the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, took ownership of the measure at the time.\n\n\"A guy named Biden wrote that bill and he wrote that bill by going down and sitting down with the president of the United States of America,\" he said during a 1993 floor debate.\n\nThe measure was a sweeping $30 billion package, which put 100,000 new police officers on the streets, created the Violence Against Women Act and an assault weapons ban.\n\nIt also expanded the federal death penalty and created dramatically harsher sentencing laws, including three strikes: mandatory life terms for people with at least three federal violent crime or drug convictions. One of the most controversial aspects of the crime bill: granting states billions to build prisons if they passed their own tough sentencing laws with mandatory minimums.\n\nBut those state laws - incentivized by the federal government - are what critics say helped contribute to mass incarceration.\n\n\"In that bill, there were longer sentences. And most of these people are in prison under state law, but the federal law set a trend,\" Bill Clinton said in 2015. \"And that was overdone. We were wrong about that. That percentage of it, we were wrong about.\"\n\n\"The good news is we had the biggest drop in crime in history. The bad news is we had a lot of people who were locked up, who were minor actors, for way too long,\" Clinton said.\n\nMichael Waldman, president of the non-partisan policy institute Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, said the debate is notable considering it is coming a quarter-century after the bill was signed into law.\n\n\"It's striking to have a debate in 2019 be about the 1994 crime bill,\" said Waldman, who worked as a speechwriter to Clinton during the period. \"Explaining the past to the present is never easy and not where you want to spend your time.\"\n\nWaldman, who is watching the debate with interest, said he wondered why Biden has fiercely defended the bill. Clinton, for example, apologized for the fallout four years ago in the middle of Hillary Clinton's campaign, saying at a 2015 NAACP convention in Philadelphia he \"signed a bill that made the problem worse, and I want to admit it.\"\n\n\"I would encourage him to take a more textured response to it,\" Waldman said of Biden. \"Some things that the bill did were good and some had lasting bad consequences.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Biden in 1993 speech pushing crime bill warned of 'predators on our streets' who were 'beyond the pale'\n\nJoe Biden in a 1993 speech warned of \"predators on our streets\" who were \"beyond the pale\" and said they must be cordoned off from the rest of society because the justice system did not know how to rehabilitate them.\n\nBiden, then chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made the comments on the Senate floor a day before a vote was scheduled on the Senate's version of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act.\n\nHis central role in shaping and shepherding the tough-on-crime bill will likely face scrutiny in a Democratic primary should he run for president in 2020. His 1993 comments, which were in line with the broad political consensus to tackling crime at the time, are at odds with a new bipartisan coalition of activists and lawmakers who are trying to undo what they say is a legacy of mass incarceration fostered by that era.\n\nBiden's word choice could also pose a problem with a new generation of Democrats who view the rhetoric at the time as perpetuating harmful myths about the black community.\n\nCNN's KFile came across the 1993 speech during a review of the former vice president's record.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton in 1994 signed the crime bill into law with broad bipartisan support as violent crime rates peaked in the US in the early 1990s. Included in the law was the federal \"three strikes\" provision, mandating life sentences for criminals convicted of a violent felony after two or more prior convictions, including drug crimes.\n\n\"We have predators on our streets that society has in fact, in part because of its neglect, created,\" said Biden, then a fourth-term senator from Delaware so committed to the bill that he has referred to it over the years as \"the Biden bill.\"\n\n\"They are beyond the pale many of those people, beyond the pale,\" Biden continued. \"And it's a sad commentary on society. We have no choice but to take them out of society.\"\n\nIn the speech, Biden described a \"cadre of young people, tens of thousands of them, born out of wedlock, without parents, without supervision, without any structure, without any conscience developing because they literally ... because they literally have not been socialized, they literally have not had an opportunity.\" He said, \"we should focus on them now\" because \"if we don't, they will, or a portion of them, will become the predators 15 years from now.\"\n\nBiden added that he didn't care \"why someone is a malefactor in society\" and that criminals needed to be \"away from my mother, your husband, our families.\"\n\nBill Russo, a spokesman for Biden, said high violent crime rates at the time was key context to understanding the bill and that, \"Senator-Biden's strong rhetoric\" was in response to Republican critiques that past efforts had been too soft on crime.\n\n\"Then-Senator Biden was referring specifically to violent crimes in the selected quotes. He was not talking about a kid stealing a candy bar, but someone who committed sexual assault, manslaughter, or murder,\" Russo told CNN in an email. \"In contrast, he says in the same speech that we need a different approach for nonviolent crimes. Specifically, he says we 'need to keep people who are first time offenders, non-violent offenders, or potential first-time offenders who in fact are people getting themselves into the crime stream from the first time - that they should be diverted from the system.'\"\n\nBiden's spokesman added the 1994 crime bill included funding \"to keep individuals who committed first-time offenses and non-violent crimes out of prison and instead in treatment and supervision,\" and that Biden advocated for prevention funding. Russo also pointed to two provisions of the bill that led to Biden's strong support of its passage: bans on high-capacity magazines and assault weapons and the Violence Against Women Act.\n\nRelated article Biden: 'I haven't always been right' on criminal justice\n\nBiden's 1993 \"predator\" remarks are similar to comments made by then-first lady Hillary Clinton in 1996, where she warned of \"superpredators\" who had \"no conscience, no empathy\" and who need to be brought \"to heel.\" During the 2016 Democratic primary, Clinton was confronted by Black Lives Matter activists over her use of the term. Clinton later told the Washington Post: \"Looking back, I shouldn't have used those words, and I wouldn't use them today.\n\nBiden defended the 1994 crime law as a whole in a 2016 interview with CNBC , saying, \"By and large, what it really did, it restored American cities.\"\n\nBut more recently, at an event talking about criminal justice in January, Biden said , \"I haven't always been right. I know we haven't always gotten things right, but I've always tried.\"\n\nHe highlighted his later work with President Barack Obama to address the sentencing disparity for crack versus powder cocaine, saying,  \"It was a big mistake when it was made,\" he said at the National Action Network's Martin Luther King Jr. breakfast in Washington. \"We thought, we were told by the experts, that crack you never go back, it was somehow fundamentally different. It's not different. But it's trapped an entire generation.\"\n\nIn the decades since it passed, portions of the act have been singled out by critics as contributing to the expansion of mass incarceration, particularly of African Americans. Speaking about mass incarceration in 2015, Bill Clinton said he \"signed a bill that made the problem worse, and I want to admit it.\"\n\nIn 1993, Biden spoke to the broad political consensus that had formed around tackling violent crime.\n\n\"The consensus is A), we must take back the streets,\" Biden said, \"It doesn't matter whether or not the person that is accosting your son or daughter or my son or daughter, my wife, your husband, my mother, your parents, it doesn't matter whether or not they were deprived as a youth. It doesn't matter whether or not they had no background that enabled them to become socialized into the fabric of society. It doesn't matter whether or not they're the victims of society. The end result is they're about to knock my mother on the head with a lead pipe, shoot my sister, beat up my wife, take on my sons.\"\n\nBiden added in his speech that rehabilitation could not be a condition for release or sentencing, because the United States criminal justice system didn't know how to rehabilitate offenders.\n\n\"I'm the guy that said rehabilitation, when it occurs, we don't understand it and notice it and even when we notice it and we know it occurs, we don't know why,\" he said. \"So you cannot make rehabilitation a condition for release.\"\n\nThe consensus, Biden again said, was the need to make streets safer. With an impassioned plea, Biden said he did not care what led someone to commit crimes.\n\n\"I don't care why someone is a malefactor in society. I don't care why someone is antisocial. I don't care why they've become a sociopath,\" Biden said. \"We have an obligation to cordon them off from the rest of society, try to help them, try to change the behavior. That's what we do in this bill. We have drug treatment and we have other treatments to try to deal with it, but they are in jail.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

      "text": "Bernie Sanders said country needed more jails and 'tougher' penalties in certain cases in 1994 remarks backing crime bill\n\nBernie Sanders said in 1994 that he agreed the country needed \"some more jails\" and that it must be \"tougher in certain instances\" on crime.\n\nThe then-congressman from Vermont made the comments during a news conference in which he explained his support for the now-controversial 1994 crime bill. His remarks, video of which was obtained by CNN's KFile from CCTV-Center for Media & Democracy , a Vermont public access station, sheds light on Sanders' support of the now more controversial elements of the bill, and his reservations about other aspects.\n\nSanders more recently has described the bill as \"terrible\" and says he is sorry he voted for it, but his view at the time was that although the bill \"isn't perfect,\" he viewed it as \"a major step forward in controlling and preventing crime.\"\n\n\"If you look at the issue of prevention versus punishment, if you like, I would've put more effort on prevention,\" said Sanders in 1994.\n\n\"If you keep kids in school, if you get jobs for young people, in the long run, not only do you prevent crime, but you save the taxpayers substantial sums of money,\" Sanders said, \"Would I rather invest in education and keeping kids in school and making college opportunity a realistic goal for millions of young people rather than necessarily building one more jail. Yeah. I think I would have gone the other way.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, do I think we need some more jails? Yup. Do I think we have to get tougher in certain instances? Yes, I do,\" Sanders said. \"So what you have is a balance here. You have more money going to law enforcement, more money going into jails. You have, on the other hand, significant sums of money going into prevention, beginning to allow us to deal with violence against women, child abuse and other very serious problems,\" Sanders said.\n\nMike Casca, the campaign communications director for Sanders, on Sunday attacked Biden for his role in the tough-on-crime legislation.\n\n\"Bernie Sanders was consistently advocating that the Biden approach was coming at the expense of jobs and education needed to keep an entire generation of kids out of jail,\" Casca told CNN.\n\nThough widely supported at the time, the 1994 law has since faced criticism from criminal justice activists for contributing to an era of mass incarceration that disproportionately affected communities of color.\n\nMost of that criticism has been directed at fellow presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden , a major architect of the legislation, while Sanders' support hasn't been nearly as scrutinized in the 2020 Democratic presidential race.\n\nUnlike Biden, Sanders was not a major architect of the bill. In the House, Sanders voted to mitigate some of the tough-on-crime provisions, including voting against a provision creating mandatory minimum sentencing for use of a gun in violent crimes or drug offenses, which ultimately passed, and repeatedly against the death penalty provisions.\n\nAnd even though he would vote in support of the final passage of the bill, Sanders said that \"more and more people will be in jail unless we begin to deal with the causes of crime.\" He also expressed reluctance to vote for a bill if it was stripped of prevention programs.\n\nThe bill passed the House with 188 Democrats voting in favor and 64 voting against.\n\nAsked about his vote by CNN's Jake Tapper last July, Sanders said he was \"not happy I voted for a terrible bill, but I am happy that I was honest with the people of my state,\" noting that he campaigned in Vermont for banning assault weapons, which was included in the bill.\n\nIn 2016, Sanders' campaign defended his record on the bill saying he opposed \"the mass incarceration and death penalty provisions in the bill.\"\n\nThe campaign pointed to a floor speech in April 1994 where he said \"all the jails in the world\" would not solve the what he implied were the root causes of crime, poverty and lack of education. His campaign said he supported the bill because of its ban on assault weapons and the Violence Against Women Act. Something Sanders himself told CNN's Brooke Baldwin in April of 2019 .\n\nYet in August 1994, Sanders, while noting the bill was not perfect, offered a broader defense of the bill and said it was a bill that \"should be supported\" with a two-pronged approach of \"increased law enforcement\" and increased prevention.\n\n\"The approach that this bill takes, in general, which I believe can work well, is based on a two pronged approach to crime,\" Sanders said. \"When I was mayor, we significantly expanded our police force and we provided stronger law enforcement, and at the same time, we developed a number of crime prevention programs. Programs designed to give young people especially ...  the opportunity to do something else with their lives rather than turn to drugs and self-destruction and crime.\"\n\n\"This legislation is not perfect. Let's be clear about it,\" he added. \"But at a time when the citizens of this country are crying out for the government to begin addressing the crisis of crime, there is no question in my mind that this bill, in a dozen different ways, is a major step forward in controlling and preventing crime. It is a bill that should be supported.\"\n\nSanders called the bill \"a step forward\" in providing \"more enforcement, more police officers, more prevention program.\" He said that providing more policing and \"stiffening penalties\" against violent criminals was \"equally important\" to putting money toward preventing crime\n\n\"Number one, simply and straightforwardly, we need more cops on the beat,\" Sanders said, adding that the bill would provide Vermont $43 million to hire new police officers. \"The state of Vermont needs more police officers. We need more community policing. We need more police protection in our most rural areas, and this legislation will play a significant role in allowing that to happen.\"\n\n\"Number two, equally importantly,\" Sanders said. \"While this legislation is very strong on increasing police protection - on stiffening penalties against criminals so that violent offenders remain behind bars where they should be - it also provides a significant sum of money to prevent crime.\"\n\n\"To keep our young people off of drugs, to stop the tragedy of violence against women before it happens, to provide alternatives so that young people do not have to turn to gangs to turn to crime,\" he continued. \"In other words, there is a significant sum of money which says let us try to get to the root causes of crime rather than just put people behind bars.\"\n\nLater, Sanders also noted, though he thought it was appropriate for the federal government to ban certain times of semi-automatic weapons, he did not think it would have a large impact on violent crime.\n\n\"I do not believe that this action is going to have some magical and profound impact on violent crime. It is not,\" he added. \"May it have some impact in taking away some very, very dangerous weapons from drug dealers and people who are outgunning our police officers right now. It may have some impact, and that's my view.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved. CNN Sans TM & © 2016 Cable News Network."

Bernie Sanders and then-Rep. Jay Inslee. But Biden, who was then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, played the largest role in the bill.\n\nThen-President Bill Clinton signed into law an omnibus crime bill in 1994 that included the federal \"three strikes\" provision, mandating life sentences for criminals convicted of a violent felony after two or more prior convictions, including drug crimes.\n\nRelated article Fact-checking Biden's claim the '94 crime bill didn't cause mass incarceration\n\nBilll Clinton said in 2015 that he regretted the bill, admitting that it worsened the nation's criminal justice system by increasing prison sentences. His comments came amid Hillary Clinton's presidential run, during which her husband's support of the bill became a political issue for the former secretary of state.\n\nDebate over the crime bill's lasting implications have already begun playing out on the 2020 campaign trail and it is expected to loom over the Democratic race in the coming months.\n\nAfter Biden defended the bill - \"This idea that the crime bill created mass incarceration, it did not create mass incarceration,\" Biden said earlier this month in New Hampshire - California Sen. Kamala Harris took issue with the former vice president's view.\n\nAfter noting that she had a \"great deal of respect\" for Biden, Harris told reporters, \"That 1994 crime bill, it did contribute to mass incarceration in our country.

He linked crime in South Bend to mass incarceration.\n\n\"If someone gets shot in a neighborhood in South Bend today, statistically it is almost always a young man of color and so, statistically often is the shooter, who was born... somewhere between 1994 and 2000,\" he said. \"And when you look at the circumstances that lead to violence and other harms, you look at the kind of adverse childhood experiences that can set somebody back in life: exposure to violence is one, exposure to drug use is one, incarceration of a parent is one.\"\n\nHe continued: \"So, the mass incarceration that may have felt in a knee-jerk way as a way to be tough on crime in the '90s is now one generation later being visited upon communities today through the absence of parents.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Biden admitted that has made mistakes when it comes to criminal justice issues.\n\n\"I haven't always been right. I know we haven't always gotten things right, but I've always tried,\" Biden said at the National Action Network's Martin Luther King Jr. breakfast in Washington in January, months before he launched his campaign.\n\nThe other candidates who supported the bill have also had to explain their votes.\n\nInslee, during a CNN town hall in April, said he regrets his prior support.\n\n\"Listen, that was a situation where many Democrats, including myself, believed we needed some response to the epidemic of crime at the time,\" Inslee said. \"But I will tell you this, if I knew then what I know now I would not have cast that vote. It has resulted in racial disparities in our system.\"\n\nSanders, unlike the others, has cautiously defended the vote , noting that he publicly spoke about his issues with the bill when it was being debated in 1994.\n\n\"I voted for that bill because it included the Violence Against Women's Act and it included a ban on assault weapon,\" Sanders told CNN in April. \"Sometimes you have legislation which includes very good stuff and very bad stuff. ...

Kamala Harris , D-Calif., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., have condemned the legislation, signed into law by President Bill Clinton, as having contributed to mass incarceration. And over the Memorial Day weekend, President Donald Trump attacked Biden for his involvement in it.\n\nHere's what was in the bill, who supported it, and what is known about the law's effects.\n\nThe Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 , or the 1994 crime bill as it became known, earmarked billions in funding for states to build new prisons, train and hire additional police, expanded the federal death penalty and instituted a federal \"three-strikes\" life sentence mandate.\n\nThe legislation also included the original Violence Against Women Act, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban and more than $6 billion in funding for crime prevention programs.\n\nThe bill was intended to combat and deter violent crime, which peaked nationally in the early 1990s. On a political level, Clinton and Democrats hoped that passage of a tough law would help them blunt or reverse long-running GOP charges that their party was soft on crime.\n\nViolent crime started to fall before the bill was passed, though it dropped much more dramatically from 1994 to 2000, according to the Brennan Center for Justice , a progressive law and policy institute.\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans supported the bill, though there were detractors in both parties.\n\nDemocrats, including most of the Congressional Black Caucus , Republicans and substantial numbers of African American pastors and mayors backed the legislation, according to reports at the time.\n\nMost supporters saw it as a way to respond to the peak in violent crime in the early 1990s that came on the heels of a decades-long increase, a trend that would soon begin to reverse.\n\n\"The American people have been looking forward to this day for a long time,\" Clinton said at a bill-signing ceremony in 1994. \"In the last 25 years, half a million Americans have been killed by other Americans. For 25 years, crime has been a hot political issue used too often to divide us while the system makes excuses for not punishing criminals and doing the job.\"\n\nBiden had been working with Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, including Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., on similar legislation even before Clinton took office.\n\nWhen the Senate passed its version of the bill in November 1993, on a 95-4 roll call, former Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, boasted about it.\n\n\"I believe the American people are starting to see that we mean business about crime, and that this bill is going to make a difference,\" he said then. \"As in all bills, there may be some things that I do not particularly like. But, overall, this bill is a tremendous addition to the fight against crime. It is, I think, the finest anti-crime bill in the history of this country.\"\n\nCurrent Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was among those who voted for it.\n\nBut there was a war brewing in the House, in which Republicans were concerned over whether the bill was tough enough on offenders, whether it spent too much on crime-prevention programs rather than punishment - the \"midnight basketball\" program became a talking point for conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh - and whether it should include a ban on certain semiautomatic weapons. Some centrist Democrats shared these objections.\n\nA House-Senate conference committee had to write two different \"final\" versions of the legislation before it could pass muster, and an unlikely coalition of Republican and Democratic opponents temporarily killed it in the House by winning on a procedural vote. Clinton agreed to demands to trim back spending for prevention programs and tweak the weapons ban to secure the votes he needed in the House.\n\nIn the end, 235 House members, including 46 Republicans, voted for it. (Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, then an independent representative from Vermont, was among the \"yes\" votes.)\n\nBut with the National Rifle Association actively engaged against the bill, and focusing its arguments on aspects other than gun control, it suddenly became a much tougher vote for GOP senators. Biden and his allies needed 60 votes in the Senate to overcome a procedural block, which meant they had to get at least six Republicans on board. They got seven and the bill went to Clinton for his signature. McConnell voted against it the second time around.\n\nDetractors at the time warned that the bill co-written by Biden was far too punitive and did not put enough of an emphasis on dealing with broader structural issues that led to the increase in violent crime. Though there was money allocated for preventative programs, the bill was focused on cracking down on crime and throwing the book at criminals.\n\nThere were alternative legislative efforts. Then-Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., said that providing billions for prison expansion was a \"simplistic approach to the crime problem.\" Conyers offered up a bill that focused on job opportunities, drug treatment and additional crime prevention programs.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Bobby Scott, D-Va., one of the Congressional Black Caucus members who voted against the crime bill, said, \"You wouldn't ask an opponent of abortion to look at a bill with the greatest expansion of abortion in the history of the United States, and argue that he ought to vote for it because it's got some highway funding in it.\"\n\nBiden has faced questions and criticism about the legislation this year, before and after announcing his bid to challenge Trump in 2020. He's mostly defended the law and taken credit for some of its successes.\n\n\"You know I've been in this fight for a long time,\" Biden said in January at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast in Washington , without explicitly remarking on the 1994 bill. \"I haven't always been right, I know we haven't always done things the right way. But I've always tried.\"\n\nAt a New Hampshire campaign stop in May, Biden talked up several specific components of the bill.\n\n\"There's a whole lot of talk about, you know,\" Biden said. \"It had three big things in it,\" he continued, listing off the funding that was allocated toward crime prevention programs, as well as the Violence Against Women Act and the ban on assault weapons, both of which are now expired.\n\nSanders also has defended his vote in favor of the bill in a similar fashion, telling CNN that if he hadn't, he would be getting asked today about why he \"did not vote for a ban on assault weapons.\"\n\nDuring that same New Hampshire event, Biden claimed that the 1994 bill did not lead to mass incarceration.\n\n\"Folks, let's get something straight, 92 out of every 100 prisoners who end up behind bars are in a state prison, not a federal prison,\" he said. \"This idea that the crime bill generated mass incarceration, it did not generate mass incarceration.\"\n\nThough the bill was not the root cause of \"mass incarceration,\" it was \"the most high-profile legislation to increase the number of people behind bars,\" according to a Brennan Center analysis in 2016.\n\nThe crime bill granted states billions to build prisons if they passed laws requiring inmates to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences, the Brennan Center said, noting that 30 states introduced or amended laws between 1995 and 1999 so that they would be in compliance and receive the money. By 1999, 42 states had \"truth-in-sentencing\" laws on the books, which contributed to an increase in imprisonment.\n\n\"By dangling bonus dollars, the crime bill encouraged states to remain on their tough-on-crime course,\" the Brennan Center wrote.\n\nAllan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

During his presidency, advocates expect change.\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nAs President-elect Joe Biden prepares his transition into the White House , he is facing mounting expectations to bring about sweeping change on criminal justice reform.\n\nAs the author of the 1994 crime bill , which was credited in part with ushering in a wave of mass incarceration of mostly Black men, and a vocal proponent of harsh policies during the \"war on drugs\" era, Biden has a long and often-criticized record on the issue.\n\nHe is also coming into power after his predecessor, President Donald Trump, signed into law one of the most significant changes to the federal criminal justice system in the 21st century. The First Step Act was the result of a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, civil rights groups and grassroots activists. Experts said it was a monumental step forward after years of criminal justice reform and \"tough on crime\" policies being used as a political cudgel in Washington.\n\nBut the legislation has flaws , as some activists have noted , and Biden will be expected to continue moving the needle. Experts told NBC News that now, as both political parties appear to have common ground on the issue and significant steps have been made over the past decade, a Biden administration needs to make criminal justice reform more than a talking point.\n\n\"The chief cornerstone has already been laid, the groundwork has already been done, the foundation has already been built. The only thing that he has to go in and do is continue to capitalize off of the momentum,\" said Louis L. Reed, the director of organizing and partnerships at #Cut50, a bipartisan criminal justice reform nonprofit. \"Biden needs to hit the ground running on legislation and executive action.\"\n\nThe Biden transition team did not respond to a request for comment on its plans. But as a presidential candidate, he proposed sweeping reforms, including ending private prisons, cash bail and mandatory-minimum sentencing. He has also been a vocal opponent of the death penalty and police reform. He has floated, for example, tying federal funds given to police departments to diversity initiatives and community policing, among other areas - rebuffing calls from progressive activists to defund police departments.\n\nThe president-elect also recently told NBC News' Lester Holt in an interview that once he is in the White House, he wants to convene a meeting with activists, police chiefs and civil rights advocates \"to determine how we move forward.\"\n\nReed, who is also a former federal inmate, said that thinking is the right way forward.\n\n\"Those closest to the problem are also closest to the solution, but often furthest from resources and power. And we think that this administration can think beyond the box, we can re-imagine justice with this current administration,\" he said. \"They need to essentially have a very tangible say over policy.\"\n\nBiden's legislative hopes also hinge on the Democrats winning the majority in the Senate in January.\n\nHe has promised a flurry of executive orders on day one in the White House to unwind a number of Trump administration policies and may opt to continue doing so if Republicans obstruct his legislative efforts . But the effectiveness of executive orders can be limited when it comes tocriminal justice reform , which would not affect state and local prisons.\n\nTackling police reform will be an especially delicate issue after a year in which the deaths of Black Americans at the hands of law enforcement prompted worldwide protests and national reckoning.\n\nBalancing the concerns of police officers and progressive activists looking to slash their budgets and re-imagine policing is one illustration, experts say, of the hurdles he could face. Biden during the campaign rejected calls to defund the police, angering some progressive activists. At the same time, he also lost support from police unions, who largely supported Trump.\n\nAdam Gelb, the founder of the Council on Criminal Justice, a bipartisan criminal justice nonprofit, is a former Senate Judiciary staffer who worked with Biden on the 1994 crime bill. He said he believes Biden's promise to be a coalition-builder is genuine, but he may not be fully prepared to restructure the nation's sprawling criminal justice system.\n\n\"I don't think he sees crime control and justice as a zero-sum game, but will focus on policies that can produce win-wins,\" he said, adding that Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris recognize that \"many of the policies of the '80s and '90s overshot the mark and are now way out of step with public sentiment, as well as research about what actually works.\"\n\nIn a sweeping Thanksgiving address on Wednesday, Biden said he believed America would \"find the root of systemic racism in this country.\"\n\nGelb said he believes Biden understands there are social inequalities but does not fully grasp the extent to which the system itself is the root of the problem.\n\n\"My sense is that he understands that the criminal justice system is deeply flawed and needs to be fixed, but that he sees the system as a source of solutions, not a fundamental cause of the problems,\" he said. \"And that means a balanced strengthening of the systems of enforcement, and prevention, and treatment, and corrections, and the courts.\"\n\nReed, however, said that from a grassroots organizing standpoint, the political winds have shifted and organizations like his and others will hold Biden accountable, particularly over restructuring policing practices, sentencing and the prison system, among other issues.\n\n\"I'm not anticipating that crime is going to go up. I'm not anticipating that unemployment is going to be at record highs,\" he said. \"But what I am saying is that, if those things do happen, then we have to have an administration that is not going to balk in the face of that level of adversity.\"\n\nDartunorro Clark covered national politics, including the Covid-19 recovery, for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Their support of punitive measures actually paved the way for Clinton. It began with the man Ebony Magazine called the \"front-line general in the war on drugs.\"\n\nOn tapes secretly recorded by former president Richard Nixon, Congressman Charles Rangel can be heard in closed door meetings urging Nixon to be more aggressive on the \"War on Drugs.\"\n\nRELATED: Analysis: Did Nancy Reagan's War on Drugs Backfire?\n\n\"Public enemy number one in the United States is drug abuse. In order to fight and defeat this enemy, it is necessary to wage a new, all-out offensive,\" the Harlem Democrat can be heard saying in words that Nixon would later mimic.\n\nRangel opposed drug legalization and embraced police militarization. He stood proudly by Nancy as President Ronald Reagan signed another drug-war law.\n\nBut if Bill and Hillary Clinton were the pot, black politicians, activists, and pastors were the kettle.\n\nCuriously, Rangel was among the 11 Congressional Black Caucus members who voted against Clinton's Crime Bill, which did not lack of black support. In addition to the dozens of pastors who signed a letter in support of the bill, it also had the support of black mayors. Kurt Schmoke, the first elected black mayor of Baltimore, was a vigorous supporter.\n\nEven then U.S. Representative Kweisi Mfume, then chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) who understood the bill was a means to \"find better ways to incarcerate people\" eventually buckled, not only supporting the bill, but was ultimately responsible for its passage by rallying a majority of CBC members to vote for it after the bill was nearly derailed on a procedural issue.\n\nThe Clintons quite likely were motivated by political expediency -- appealing to white voters with \"tough on crime\" measures; however it is clear black leaders were simply desperate to rid communities of the gang violence terrorizing their communities. The crime wave was real with rapes, assaults, and murders at never before seen levels, especially in inner-cities.\n\nThey didn't have the benefit of knowing what we do now: that the death penalty would be disproportionately administered to black defendants; that many imprisoned didn't pose a serious threat; that many of the \"criminals\" had actually been victims of childhood lead poisoning which studies show link to \"impulsivity, behavioral problems, hyperactivity, and impaired cognition, all of which are associated with crime.\"\n\nFollow NBCBLK on Facebook , Twitter and Instagram .\n\nYolanda Young is a columnist and the founder of Lawyers of Color.

      "text": "Analysis: How the media created a 'superpredator' myth that harmed a generation of Black youth\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nThis article was published in partnership with The Marshall Project , a nonprofit news organization covering the U.S. criminal justice system. Sign up for The Marshall Project's newsletter or follow it on Facebook or Twitter .\n\nThe epithet is a quarter-century old, but it still has sting: \"He called them superpredators,\" Donald Trump insisted in his final debate with Joe Biden. \"He said that, he said it. Superpredators.\"\n\n\"I never, ever said what he accused me of saying,\" Biden protested. While there is no record of Biden using the phrase, much of the harsh anti-crime legislation embraced by both parties in the 1990s continues to be a hot-button issue to this day. From the moment the term was born, 25 years ago this month, \"superpredator\" had a game-changing potency, derived in part from the avalanche of media coverage that began almost immediately.\n\n\"It was a word that was constantly in my orbit,\" said Steve Drizin, a Chicago lawyer who defended teenagers in the 1990s. \"It had a profound effect on the way in which judges and prosecutors viewed my clients.\"\n\nAn academic named John J. DiIulio Jr. coined the term for a November 1995 cover story in The Weekly Standard, a brand-new magazine of conservative political opinion that hit pay dirt with the provocative coverline, \" The Coming of the Super-Predators .\"\n\nThen a young professor at Princeton University, DiIulio was extrapolating from a study of Philadelphia boys that calculated that 6 percent of them accounted for more than half the serious crimes committed by the whole cohort. He blamed these chronic offenders on \"moral poverty ... the poverty of being without loving, capable, responsible adults who teach you right from wrong.\"\n\nDiIulio warned that by the year 2000 an additional 30,000 young \"murderers, rapists, and muggers\" would be roaming America's streets, sowing mayhem. \"They place zero value on the lives of their victims, whom they reflexively dehumanize as just so much worthless 'white trash,'\" he wrote.\n\nBut who was doing the dehumanizing? Just a few years before, the news media had introduced the terms \"wilding\" and \"wolf pack\" to the national vocabulary, to describe five teenagers - four Black and one Hispanic - who were convicted and later exonerated of the rape of a woman in New York's Central Park.\n\n\"This kind of animal imagery was already in the conversation,\" said Kim Taylor-Thompson, a law professor at New York University. \"The superpredator language began a process of allowing us to suspend our feelings of empathy towards young people of color.\"\n\nThe \"superpredator\" theory, besides being a racist trope, was not borne out in crime statistics. Juvenile arrests for murder - and juvenile crime generally - had already started falling when DiIulio's article was published. By 2000, when tens of thousands more children were supposed to be out there mugging and killing, juvenile murder arrests had fallen by two-thirds.\n\nThough it failed as a theory, as fodder for editorials, columns and magazine features, the term \"superpredator\" was a tragic success - with an enormous, and lasting, human toll.\n\nTerrance Lewis was 19 and returning from work in 1997 when Philadelphia police trapped him on a bridge, guns drawn, and arrested him for a murder that he spent 21 years in prison trying to prove he did not commit. Only last year did the judge finally throw out his homicide conviction, citing faulty eyewitness testimony.\n\n\"I'm a recipient of the backlash of that superpredator rhetoric,\" said Lewis, now 42. \"The media believed in the rhetoric. All the coverage from back in that era was to amplify that rhetoric.\"\n\nDiIulio's big idea wasn't original. His mentor as a graduate student at Harvard, the influential political scientist James Q. Wilson, had been warning for years about a new breed of conscience-less teen killers. (\"I didn't go to Harvard,\" DiIulio told one interviewer. \"I went to Wilson.\")\n\nBut DiIulio was a clever popularizer who quickly became a darling of the think-tank circuit - and of the media. The Marshall Project's review of 40 major news outlets in the five years after his Weekly Standard article shows the neologism popping up nearly 300 times, and that is an undercount.\n\nThere was the Philadelphia Inquirer's fawning magazine profile of DiIulio, who grew up there. (Until recently, Pennsylvania had the country's largest population of people still serving life sentences without parole - for crimes they committed as children.) There was also a lengthy, mostly gentle New Yorker profile; a spot on The New York Times' op-ed page; and an appearance on the CBS Evening News .\n\nThe media exposure led to conference invitations, which led to more media exposure. The word \"superpredator\" became so much a part of the national vocabulary that journalists and talk show hosts used it without reference to DiIulio - including even Oprah Winfrey, in a segment on \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nThe Weekly Standard's founding editor, Bill Kristol, now downplays the blockbuster cover story of his defunct magazine. But he admits: \"It struck a nerve. And it caught on.\"\n\nThe notion of an impending wave of teenage savagery caught on among criminologists, too.\n\n\"How did these ideas get supported and weaponized throughout the decades? Academics also played a role,\" says Jeremy Travis, then at the National Institute of Justice, the research arm of the Justice Department, and now at Arnold Ventures, a charitable foundation from which The Marshall Project receives funding.\n\nJames Alan Fox, a professor of criminology at Northeastern University, says he never used the term \"superpredator,\" but he warned in numerous media appearances about the coming teen crime wave, and makes no apologies. \"One of the things about forecasts is that they're sometimes wrong,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, having sparked the media's feeding frenzy, DiIulio soon started sounding doubtful. \"The term 'superpredator' has become, I guess, part of the lexicon,\" he told NPR in the summer of 1996. The word had \"sort of gotten out and gotten away from me.\"\n\nOf the 281 media mentions of \"superpredators\" we found from 1995 to 2000, more than three in five used the term without questioning its validity. The remainder included writers who contested DiIulio's thesis in op-ed articles of their own, readers writing outraged letters, or journalists quoting a number of dissenters in their articles.\n\nAlthough it made the news pages, the term \"superpredator\" appeared most often in commentaries and editorials, and in newsmagazines. An emerging \"journalism of ideas\" would gather force through the 1990s as cable television and the internet took hold. News outlets that once focused on telling their readers the basic facts now felt they had to explain, in the words of one of Newsweek's advertising slogans, \"Why it happened. What it means.\"\n\nIn January 1996, the magazine asked in a headline, \"'Superpredators' Arrive: Should we cage the new breed of vicious kids?\" (Full disclosure: We both worked at Newsweek in the 1990s, and regret not protesting its crime coverage at the time.)\n\nIt's commonplace to blame local news media for exaggerated crime fears, especially local TV with its famous dictum, \"if it bleeds, it leads.\" But crime coverage went national in the 1990s. According to one study , at the beginning of the decade, the three national news networks ran fewer than 100 crime stories a year on their nightly news broadcasts. By the end of the '90s, they were running more than 500. On NBC News, a February 1993 segment on \"Nightly News\" focused on teen killers in the suburbs and rural areas, while one in December 1994 warned of a crime wave as America's teen population swelled.\n\nThe record doesn't show then-President Bill Clinton using the word \"superpredator,\" but Hillary Clinton did as first lady. And he certainly helped amplify crime as a national story. Political reporters were dazzled by his legerdemain in stealing a traditionally Republican issue, promising more law enforcement on the streets and tougher penalties for juvenile offenders.\n\nThe 1994 Crime Bill, a package of mostly draconian federal laws, was national news. And Sen. Robert Dole, the Kansas Republican running against Clinton in 1996, with the economy humming and the Cold War over, needed an issue to hammer. When he talked about \"superpredators,\" that made national news , too.\n\nAs some criminologists explained at the time, what drove juvenile homicides in the 1990s wasn't a new breed of violent teens. It was probably the greater availability of guns, making fights and gang rivalries among kids more lethal than before, said Franklin Zimring, a Berkeley law school professor. But to paraphrase Mark Twain, the truth was still putting on its shoes while the \"superpredators\" ran out the door.\n\nState legislatures were already busy dismantling a century's worth of protections for juveniles when the fear of \"superpredators\" gave them a new push. New York had started the trend in 1978 after 15-year-old Willie Bosket killed two people on the subway. The media led that charge, too: Gov. Hugh Carey read a sensationalized story about Bosket in the New York Daily News (\"He's 15 and He Likes to Kill - Because It's Fun\"), and immediately called a special session of the legislature that stripped children of many protections of juvenile court.\n\nIllinois followed suit, starting in 1982. At the end of Denver's media-driven \" summer of violence \" panic in 1993, Gov. Roy Romer pushed through an \"iron-fist\" overhaul of Colorado's juvenile justice system. By the end of the 1990s, virtually every state had toughened its laws on juveniles: sending them more readily into adult prisons; gutting and sidelining family courts; and imposing mandatory sentences, including life sentences without parole.\n\nReaders who had already been subjected to a steady stream of horrific stories about child killers were primed for the \"superpredator\" theory. In Chicago, gruesome murders by children rocked the city in the early 1990s, including the case of Robert Sandifer, an 11-year-old whose love for cookies earned him the nickname \"Yummy.\" He was being sought for the murder of a 14-year-old girl in late summer 1994, when he was himself murdered by brothers Cragg and Derrick Hardaway, ages 16 and 14.\n\nThe local crime became a national story. Time magazine put Yummy's picture on the cover : \"So Young To Kill. So Young To Die.\" By the time Derrick Hardaway was sentenced in adult court in 1996, at the height of the \"superpredator\" frenzy, he got 45 years in prison for Yummy's murder. Not for pulling the trigger, but for driving his brother's getaway car.\n\n\"I hate the media,\" said Hardaway, who was released in 2016, in an interview last month. \"I feel like I was convicted through the media.\"\n\n\"The reaction was, the way to stop this crime problem is to hit 'em hard,\" said Don Wycliff, then the editor of the Chicago Tribune editorial pages. \"I don't recall a lot of persuasive dissenting voices at that time.\"\n\nWhen the \"superpredator\" concept was born a year after Yummy's death, the Trib was all in. Just 10 days after DiIulio's piece, the editorial board cited him in its argument for bringing back orphanages. A prominent and widely syndicated columnist for the Tribune, Bob Greene, advised readers to \"stop thinking of the superpredators as merely some projected future phenomenon [but] something based on current fact.\" The Tribune even devoted its entire op-ed page to reprinting DiIulio's Weekly Standard piece.\n\n\"What can I say?\" Wycliff said. \"It seemed to explain a lot of things.\"\n\nThe Chicago Tribune would later publish exceptional work uncovering years of police abuse and misconduct by local prosecutors. But reporter Maurice Possley said his sources sometimes asked, \"Where was the Tribune when all this bad stuff was going on in these courtrooms?\"\n\nJournalists of color say that a lack of diversity in American newsrooms influenced criminal justice coverage. Black reporters at the Tribune were so dismayed by their white editors' narrow outlook that in the early 1990s, one of them, Dahleen Glanton, organized a minivan ride to the city's Black neighborhoods.\n\n\"There were top editors who had never been to the South Side of Chicago,\" she remembers. (The editors most directly responsible for the Chicago Tribune's op-ed page when it reprinted DiIulio's piece, Wycliff and Marcia Lythcott, are both Black. Neither one remembers making the decision to run it. \"I hated that term,\" Lythcott says now.)\n\nBy the late 1990s, the \"superpredator\" mania was dying down. \"Young killers remain well-publicized rarity,\" a Tribune headline said in February 1998. \"'Superpredators' fail to grow into forecast proportions.\"\n\nIn 2001, DiIulio admitted his theory had been mistaken, saying ''I'm sorry for any unintended consequences.\" In 2012, he even signed on to a brief filed with the U.S. Supreme Court supporting a successful effort to limit life sentences without parole for juveniles. (DiIulio's wife said he was not available for comment for this article due to ill health.)\n\nAs the Biden-Trump debates showed, politicians now feel the need to backpedal from the term. When she was running for president in 2016, Hillary Clinton was pressed to apologize for using \"superpredators\" 20 years before.\n\nFew media outlets have apologized for \"superpredators.\" The Los Angeles Times conceded in September that \"an insidious problem ... has marred the work of the Los Angeles Times for much of its history ... a blind spot, at worst an outright hostility, for the city's nonwhite population.\" Indeed, our analysis shows that the L.A. Times used \"superpredator\" more than any other major newspaper. But it was hardly alone in branding a generation of young men of color as animals and paving the way for harsher juvenile justice.\n\n\"If we don't acknowledge the impact of what past stories did,\" said law professor Taylor-Thompson, \"I'm not sure the media's behavior will change.\"\n\nThe research for this article was sponsored in part by a grant from the Brown Institute for Media Innovation.\n\nSource: Non-scientific review of all mentions of \"superpredator\" and its variations in 40 major U.S. news outlets from 1995 to 2000.\n\nCarroll Bogert is president of The Marshall Project.\n\nLynNell Hancock is professor emerita at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who attended the event, and Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., who did not, released a joint statement praising Trump's position following his remarks.\n\n\"President Trump's endorsement of the bipartisan criminal justice reform compromise is an important step in our shared effort to promote safe communities and improve justice,\" they said. \"By preparing inmates bound for release to become productive citizens, we can reduce crime and the social and economic cost of incarceration. And by ensuring that punishments fit the crimes, we can better balance the scales of justice.\"\n\nThe House passed a piece of the proposal earlier this year with 360 votes - including 226 Republicans and 134 Democrats.\n\nThe deal emerging in the Senate would include a retroactive application of a 2010 law designed to create greater parity in sentencing for crack and powder cocaine convictions.\n\nTrump thanked his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has been the White House point person on its delayed criminal justice reform efforts .\n\n\"He feels very deeply about it,\" Trump said.\n\nKushner wanted to push the effort forward in September, according to a White House official, who said the senior Trump adviser met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell then to try to see if the Senate could \"jam this in\" before the election.\n\nMcConnell, per this official, essentially asked the White House to \"let this go until after the election,\" and in return promised to whip the vote. He suggested Kushner \"finalize your language, shore up support\" and then McConnell would check on the vote count and try to take it to the floor if it had enough backing.\n\nDespite the fact that former attorney general Jeff Sessions had opposed many of the suggested sentencing reforms, this official said it was \"coincidental\" that they had happened so soon after his departure, and \"no correlation\" between his exit and the announcement; before his exit, they said, Sessions had appeared to be on board with most of the elements involved.\n\nAnd despite the president's repeated nods Wednesday to the bipartisan nature of the push, there were no Democratic lawmakers appeared at Wednesday's event. And despite the president's endorsement, it's still not clear how involved he plans to be in working the phones to try to sway votes.\n\nStill, the White House official pointed to behind-the-scenes talks between administration aides and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, predicting the package would \"way more than clear 60 votes\" in the Senate.\n\nJonathan Allen is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News.\n\nHallie Jackson is senior Washington correspondent for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Donald Trump used to brag about the First Step Act. Not any more.\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe First Step Act, Donald Trumpâs marquee criminal justice reform package, became a centerpiece of his 2020 campaign â exhibit A of him doing what no other politician could do. Itâs getting a different treatment from Republicans now.\n\nRon DeSantis has pledged to repeal the law. Mike Pence has said itâs time to ârethinkâ it. Trump himself rarely talks about it; when asked about sentencing reform by Fox News today, he touted his new proposal to give drug dealers the death penalty.\n\nWith little pushback, and to the amazement of the bipartisan coalition that passed it, the ex-presidentâs rivals now characterize what was arguably his biggest bipartisan victory as a well-intentioned mistake.\n\nâItâs campaign rhetoric, and they know they canât deliver on it,â said Jason Pye , who lobbied for the law with the libertarian group FreedomWorks, and now runs ârule of law initiativesâ at the Due Process Institute. âAnd itâs fascinating, because the impact of the law is exactly what we wanted it to be.â\n\nDeSantis has led the pack on repeal, calling the bipartisan legislation a âjailbreak bill,â blaming it for higher crime, and denouncing the release of a terrorism financier who benefited from its sentencing reduction.\n\nâTheyâre releasing people who have not been rehabilitated early, so that they can prey on people in our society,â DeSantis said on The Ben Shapiro Show last month, echoing some of the lawâs original critics, like Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton.\n\nDeSantis, who signed a number of tough sentencing laws before launching his campaign, hasnât detailed his specific problems with the law, which reduced mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, expanded education and vocational programs in prisons, and moved thousands of prisoners into home confinement or halfway houses. The Department of Justice recently found that just 12.4% of prisoners released under it had committed new offenses, compared to the recent average of 43% for all federal ex-prisoners.\n\nBut Trump hasnât defended the First Step Act, either. His campaign only hit back at DeSantis for criticizing the law after voting for an earlier, less-comprehensive version in the House. (His campaign did not respond to a request to comment for this article). His former vice president said at a CNN town hall this month that âwe need to take a step back from the approach of the First Step Actâ to get âserious and toughâ on crime.\n\nâWeâve got a crime wave in our major cities,â Pence said. âNow more than ever, we ought to be thinking about how we make penalties tougher on people that are victimizing families in this country.â\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who voted for the law and earned bipartisan credit for getting it over the finish line, appears to be the one 2024 challenger willing to defend it.\n\nâThe legislation is working the way it was intended to,â Scott told Fox News host Lawrence Jones . âAttacking President Trump is just a terrible idea, especially on legislation where, the more you look at it, the better it gets.â But Scott himself hasnât talked much about First Step on the trail; a section of his website devoted to his ârecordâ on crime-fighting mentions two pro-police and tougher sentencing bills that havenât passed, but not the historic 2018 law.\n\nIn this article:\n\nYou canât overstate how much the First Step Act mattered to Trumpâs 2020 run, especially after he realized that Joe Biden, who helped author the 1994 crime bill loathed by criminal justice reform advocates, would win the Democratic nomination. The law featured prominently in an effort to win over Black voters, which bumped his share of that electorate from 8% in 2016 to 12% against Joe Biden.\n\nThe Trump re-elect spent millions to run a clemency and First Step-focused ad during the 2020 Super Bowl, focused on the moment that a non-violent drug trafficking convict named Alice Marie Johnson was released from federal prison. The message: âPoliticians talk about criminal justice reform. President Trump got it done.â\n\nJohnson would repeat that message at the Republican National Convention, as the Trump campaign ran swing-state ads about Bidenâs role in the sentencing laws that First Step partially rolled back. When he faced then-California Sen. Kamala Harris in their only debate, Pence attacked her from the left on criminal justice reform.\n\nâYou increased the disproportionate incarceration of Blacks in California,â Pence told Harris. âYou did nothing on criminal justice reform in California. You didnât lift a finger to pass the First Step Act on Capitol Hill.â\n\nBut Trump (and Pence) lost, Biden won. A Democratic administration started administering the law. Crime went up, and Republicans ran midterm campaigns against the progressive reforms (softer sentencing, more prosecutorial discretion, bail reform) that grew out of 2020âs George Floyd protests.\n\nThat quickly changed the conversation around First Step, to Johnsonâs dismay; in an interview with Politico last week, she worried that DeSantis and other critics were âdehumanizing the peopleâ for craven political reasons. The Next Step Act, introduced by New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker to build on the new consensus and his unexpected win with Trump, never picked up momentum. But he hasnât been approached by Republicans seeking to seriously revisit the First Step Act, either.\n\nThe coalition of left-wing and libertarian criminal justice reformers that backed First Step is weaker than it was in 2018; the Koch political network, which worked on passage for years, is now running ads to beat Trump. But advocates said that they were more disappointed by the political rhetoric than worried about opponents getting 60 senators to scrap the law.\n\nâWeâre 3-plus years into implementation, and youâre still looking at a 12% recidivism rate,â said Timothy Head, the executive director of the Faith & Freedom Coalition, which is hosting 11 presidential candidates in D.C. this week. âIf you offered any state corrections officer in any state in America a 12% recidivism rate, theyâd be celebrating.â\n\nAmes Grawert, a senior counsel at the left-leaning Brennan Center, said that the linkage DeSantis and Pence made between reform and rising crime didnât make any sense. âThese are people from across the country,â he said of people being freed under First Step. âTo think that this small group of people could somehow translate to a nationwide increase in murder rates â red state, blue state, urban, rural, etc. â just doesnât hold water.â\n\nThe walk-back from criminal justice reform has also come at a somewhat strange moment in the campaign. The murder rate, in most cities, appears to have fallen since last year, with no change to how Republicans running for president talk about it. Rather, the candidates continue to highlight gruesome local crime stories to portray a country falling apart under Joe Biden.\n\nAt least one of this yearâs presidential candidates is attempting to attack the First Step Act without laying blame on Trump for its purported shortcomings â which may be a dual sign of just how toxic criminal justice reform has become in GOP circles even as the former president remains popular. Vivek Ramaswamy told Semafor that criticisms of the statute had already âdevolved into a tired talking pointâ for other contenders, and blamed Biden for implementing the law too laxly\n\nâThe U.S. Sentencing Commission under Biden loosened provisions to make the First Step Act more lenient to criminals than was initially intended,â he said. âBased on this abuse of the statute by the Biden administration, I would repeal it.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Americana\n\nTHE SCENE\n\nPresident Joe Bidenâs handling of the Israel-Gaza war has angered and alienated Democrats. In polling before last weekâs temporary truce â which collapsed on Friday morning â up to 70% of them were unhappy with the administrationâs course.\n\nSome of those disgruntled 2020 Biden voters are threatening not to vote at all, a problem that Democrats think they can fix. But those voters are also being pitched by third party candidates â a non-factor in the 2020 election but an emerging one ahead of 2024.\n\nAt campaign stops and in interviews, both independent Cornel West and two-time Green Party nominee Jill Stein have called for a âpermanent ceasefire,â wooing unhappy Democrats and independents who wonât hear that from their president.\n\nâI was already considering a run,â said Stein, who entered the race a month after the start of the war. âIt felt much more urgent once I saw the overwhelming support from the two war parties for the Netanyahu regimeâs campaign of mass slaughter, collective punishment, ethnic cleansing, and blatant war crimes.â\n\nDAVIDâS VIEW\n\nDemocrats arenât terribly worried right now about Stein or West, for the simple reason that each candidate will need to put time and money into swing state ballot access. Westâs candidacy starts with none; the Greens have automatic access in 19 states, including Michigan, but have failed to make the ballot in other swing states in close races.\n\nThe third-party candidate with the most resources right now doesnât offer much to those who oppose Bidenâs approach to Gaza. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., whose criticism of Ukraine war funding intrigued some Biden critics, is less critical of Israel than the president.\n\nâIsrael is doing more right now to protect human life, and has done more over the past 16 years to avoid this outcome, than we would expect of any nation in the world,â Kennedy told NewsNationâs Chris Cuomo this week.\n\nStill, Biden simply didnât have a problem on his far-left flank in 2020 â and now, he does.\n\nSteinâs 2016 run followed the usual pattern for modern third-party candidates. That summer, after Hillary Clinton had defeated Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination, she polled as high as 5% in national surveys; Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Partyâs nominee, hit double-digits. Their support contracted on Election Day, but in swing states, their combined vote was larger than the gap between Clinton and Donald Trump.\n\nDemocrats fixed that problem in 2020, as millions of anti-Trump voters whoâd rejected Clinton cast a strategic ballot for Biden. But the president is far less popular than he was then, and polls that include a range of third-party candidates â West, Stein, and Kennedy â have found Bidenâs support slipping below 40% in key states.\n\nâTheyâre taking votes out of the Biden column, and thatâs going to help Republicans,â said Jason Roe, a Michigan GOP strategist. âThe natural back-and-forth between the parties is going to force some of these Democrats to say things that will alienate pro-Palestinian voters. They will not be able to help themselves; they are damned if they do, and damned if they donât.â\n\nTHE VIEW FROM MICHIGAN\n\nMuslim and Arab-American political activists have been working through those concerns. Emgage, a group that turns out and educates Muslim voters, conducted polling after the start of the war that found a massive drop-off in support for Biden and a surge of interest in supporting an alternative to Trump or Biden. Itâs too early, said Emgage CEO Waâel Alzayat, to say what could happen with those voters.\n\nâOur assessment is that third party candidates are not viable,â Alzayat told Semafor. âGiven the elections and the reality of American politics, we assess that a vote for a third-party candidate is a vote for Trump.â\n\nThe issue may be most acute for Biden in Michigan, where there are an estimated 200,000 registered Muslim voters in the state, and more than 300,000 voters with roots in the Arab world. âThe majority of Americans support a ceasefire,â Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib said outside the White House on Wednesday evening, joining a hunger strike and vigil that commemorated the Palestinians killed since the start of the war. âSeventy-one percent of Michigan Democrats, in my district, support a ceasefire.â\n\nDemocrats in the state tell Semafor that theyâve been working proactively, with âinternal discussions and outreach,â to calm those groups. Meanwhile, some influencers on the anti-Biden left are already looking to head off accusations that third parties are threatening to play the role of spoilers.\n\nâThird party voters are mostly people who were never going to vote for Biden,â said Briahna Joy Gray, the national press secretary for the 2020 Sanders campaign, and the co-host of The Hillâs talk show âRising.â âBut to the extent that Bidenâs support among key Biden voting groups, like Arab-Americans in Michigan, is way down, thatâs because of his own policies â not the appeal of third-party candidates.â\n\nNOTABLE\n\nAmericans for Prosperity Action, âWe Have a Country to Save.â The Koch networkâs endorsement of Nikki Haley came with three benefits: A grassroots campaign network, access to potential new donors, and tens of millions of dollars in direct spending. This 60-second spot is its first flex, telling early-state voters that Donald Trump and Biden âhad their chance,â but only Haley can turn the country around, reducing the national debt by taking on âreckless spending from both parties.â\n\nNikki Haley for President, âMoral Clarity.â Haleyâs own early-state ad â the first from her campaign, after months of spending by her SFA Fund super PAC â is entirely narrated by the candidate herself. Neither Biden nor Trump is mentioned by name. Instead, she portrays a country in danger, with âchaos on our streets and college campuses,â that canât be fixed by some unnamed alternative candidate whoâd maintain âthe chaos and drama of the past.â\n\nDemocratic National Committee, âYour Family.â The presidentâs campaign spent the week hammering Trump over a free-flowing Truth Social post that promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act â a goal no other GOP candidate discusses anymore. But this swing state ad doesnât mention Trump at all. A pediatric nurse from Nevada refers instead to âthe last administrationâ and how she doesnât âwant to go backâ to a time before Biden lowered healthcare costs.\n\nA little more than one month ago, the House voted in a landslide to support Israelâs war in Gaza â 412 members for, and just 10 against. Public opinion isnât that lopsided. Nearly three-quarters of Republicans support the actions taken by Israel, but independents are split down the middle, and 63% of Democrats oppose it. Just 30% of adults born after 1988 back Israel, and just 30% of all non-white adults, and that explains the swoon in support for Biden since Oct. 7.\n\nWeeks after they voted to put Democrats in control of Virginiaâs legislature, most adults in the commonwealth still approve of GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin, disapprove of Biden, and highly disapprove of Trump. Just 23% of adults say the country is âgoing in the right direction,â but 50% say Virginia is, and that numberâs been fairly stable for the last seven years, through multiple changes in local government.\n\nWhite House . Ron DeSantis debated California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday night â a âGreat Red State vs. Blue Stateâ showdown, hosted by Fox News, that the Democrat used to mock DeSantis for his stalled-out poll numbers.\n\nâWhen are you going to drop out and give Nikki Haley a shot to win?â Newsom asked, after pointing out that the Florida governor trailed Trump âin your home state.â\n\nAcross three televised primary debates against Republicans, DeSantis never spent so much time attacking or fending off attacks. And on Thursday, hadnât shaken his habit of telling long-winded anecdotes; pressed on Floridaâs six-week abortion ban, which polls terribly in swing states, he mused that âsome states have done later and obviously they have a right to do that.â But he got and took multiple attempts to attack Democrats over the cost of living â especially when Newsom said that Biden was âdoing fantasticallyâ and would serve another term.\n\nâHow great is it when youâre going to the grocery store now?â DeSantis asked the TV audience. âHow great is it when youâre trying to afford a home? How are those interest rates doing? What about affording a new car?â\n\nIn Florida, the three Democrats challenging Biden cried foul after the party canceled its March 2024 primary. The reason? As Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried previously told Americana, all presidential candidates had to notify the state party that they will be on the primary ballot before its convention â an event that was held the last weekend of October, as Rep. Dean Phillips entered the race.\n\nNeither Phillips nor Marianne Williamson or Cenk Uygur checked off that box. On Nov. 1 , Florida Democrats told the state that Biden was the only candidate whoâd qualified for the ballot; under Florida law, if only one candidate files for a primary, the primary isnât held at all. Phillips threatened to sue, and Uygur and Williamson scheduled a Friday press conference on their own plans to protest the move.\n\nâThe Democratic Party elite seem to think thereâs no reason to open this up and listen to our base since they in their infinite paternalistic wisdom simply know whatâs best,â Williamson told Semafor. âOne of the reasons they will have a spoiler problem is how disgusted people are by Democratic efforts to block any candidacies except Biden, their suppression of democracy in the name of saving our democracy.â\n\nHouse. Now-former New York Rep. George Santos was expelled from the House on Friday, setting up a wintry special election on Long Island, which under state law will have to take place within 90 days.There wonât be a primary â the Democratic and Republican parties in Queens and Nassau County, which encompass the vacant 3rd District, will select the nominees.\n\nEight Republicans were already running in the regular 2024 primary to replace Santos; ex-police officer Mike Sapraicone and Afghanistan War veteran Kellen Curry had built the most robust early operations. Six Democrats, including ex-Rep. Tom Suozzi, had entered their primary. Biden carried the seat by 8 points in 2020, but ex-Rep. Lee Zeldin carried it in his 2022 run against Gov. Kathy Hochul.\n\nIn his new book, the Republican strategist Patrick Ruffini makes a confession: He went to college. The co-founder of Echelon Insights, a veteran of the 2004 George W. Bush campaign, was as surprised as anyone when Trump won the presidency. That victory made sense when Ruffini realized that an education gap â college-educated voters versus everybody else â was supplanting the decades-old class gap between Republicans and Democrats. His field work and research on that phenomenon turned into âParty of the People,â a look at how Democratic mistakes and MAGA policies (like abandoning entitlement reform and free trade) could turn the GOP into a multi-racial populist party. This is an edited transcript of our conversation about it.\n\nAmericana: Republicans had a pretty mediocre 2022. What are the trends that can make them the majority, working-class party? Did they stall out?\n\nPatrick Ruffini: The Dobbs decision was the difference between a five- or six-point Republican landslide and their barely eking out a House majority in 2022. But if Trump or another Republican were to simply recreate the GOPâs performance in the House in the midterms, theyâd win. Despite clearly falling short in a number of races, the GOP got a record high number of Black and Hispanic voters for a midterms. Part of having a working-class coalition is that Republicans may now have an easier time in presidential rather than downballot elections, in a direct reversal of the Obama era.\n\nIn 2020, the same trends we saw realign working class white voters came for nonwhite voters, Hispanics especially, but some Black and Asian American voters too, especially in the working class. This tells us that the divide in the country is more cultural, along education lines, than it is racial, and it turns out that the nonwhite working class has a lot more in common with the white working class than people thought. Thatâs particularly true when you have a candidate like Trump who plays on populist themes, instead of the old country club, Chamber of Commerce-style Republican.\n\nAmericana: What did Trump do to advance this? Thereâs a lot in the book about mistakes that Democrats made, but what actual actions was he taking to convert these voters?\n\nPatrick Ruffini: The economy was growing in a way that uniquely benefited Latinos. Their incomes went up by about 20% during a period that spans from the end of Obamaâs presidency through most of Trumpâs presidency. Trump, being on the tail end of this, got the credit. And border regions like the Rio Grande Valley are at the top of the heap in terms of income growth. On top of it, you had the fracking revolution and young men from the region getting jobs in the West Texas oil fields. Then COVID happens. The oil industry and the economy generally shuts down, and Trump is the one talking about getting things reopened. This was not a community that could just go to work on Zoom.\n\nAmericana: You point out that some Democrats, like John Fetterman, have been able to win despite lower turnout from Black voters. How much of what Republicans need is conversion, and how much is drop-off from working-class voters who used to vote for Democrats?\n\nPatrick Ruffini: In 2016, most of Trumpâs margin of victory in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin comes from changes in the Black vote, both in turnout and persuasion. Without Obama at the top of the ticket, this isnât entirely unexpected. But it has a knock-on effect. What does Hillary Clinton do to try to keep Black turnout high? She talks more about race than Obama did, using terms like âstructural racism.â And in so doing, she probably ticks off the white working class. If youâre a laid off steelworker in Ohio, you donât exactly feel like youâre basking in white privilege.\n\nAmericana: Before Hillary gets into the race, she talks about criminal justice reform, mass incarceration, maybe we should reverse some of the 1994 crime bill.\n\nPatrick Ruffini: Right. And there was this belief that Trump was a uniquely noxious figure on racial issues that would keep Black voters engaged. This assumption turns out to be totally wrong. And in 2020, Trump seems to take a hit in the polls because of his handling of the George Floyd summer, and still does better among Black voters that fall. The priorities these voters have, like safe streets, are not the ones white liberals think.\n\nAmericana: So what policies should Republicans, when theyâre back in power, be enacting to win more of these voters? And what should they be avoiding?\n\nPatrick Ruffini: Itâs a little hard to answer, because youâve seen a lot of these trends play out without a big shift in Republican policy priorities. But letâs say that hypothetically thereâs a Republican trifecta in 2025. If Republicans view that as a license to run back the 2005 Bush Social Security plan, or do some sort of massive entitlement reform, that would jeopardize the gains in this new coalition. Same goes for trying to repeal Obamacare. Trump was pretty successful at narrowing the perceived gap between the parties on economic issues. The days of a GOP focused on marginal rate cuts are probably over.\n\nAmericana: Right, the Biden administration has leaned into this problem. It hasnât gone back to Obama-era free trade policies. It passed an infrastructure bill, itâs backed labor, and it hasnât gotten a political benefit. Why is that?\n\nPatrick Ruffini: Inflation has just overshadowed everything. As a Republican, Iâll concede that Trumpâs initial COVID spending did as much to cause inflation as Bidenâs policies have. But Trump got all of the upside politically from this spending, and Biden got all the downside as inflation starts to tick up right after he takes office.\n\nAmericana: There are Democrats who say Trump brings out people other Republicans donât â weâre talking about that now â but if Republicans run DeSantis or Haley, we can pin them down on Social Security, Medicare, the retirement age. So is Trump actually the strongest potential nominee they have?\n\nPatrick Ruffini: He has a long list of strengths and a long list of weaknesses. The assets and liabilities for the other candidates are more of a question mark. What youâre seeing in the polls right now, at least with Haley, is that she doesnât really lose many voters Trump would get, and gets back some of the suburban voters Trump lost. This is essentially what you saw with the Team Normal Republicans like Youngkin and [Georgia Gov. Brian] Kemp. They donât lose any votes in places Trump did really well, and they win back enough suburbanites. We seem to be locked into the Trump coalitions as a baseline, but the question is how well can you do in the suburbs?\n\nAnd yet our ideas about this are cryogenically frozen in 2016, where there were just two starkly different coalitions. There was a Romney coalition, and then a Trump coalition, and you had to choose which to embrace. Now thereâs a stable Trump coalition and I donât think youâre going to see much erosion in rural areas, nor will we see a massive reversion to Romney-era support levels for the GOP in suburbs. Those old voting patterns are gone. But if youâre Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis, and you hold that rural coalition and win back even a third of the Romney-Biden voters in suburbs, youâre winning Georgia comfortably.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Fact check: 1994 crime bill did not bring mass incarceration of Black Americans\n\nThe 1994 crime bill, signed by President Bill Clinton, was a grab-bag of crime-fighting measures, ranging from three-strike provisions mandating a life sentence for repeat offenders and funding for states to hire 100,000 additional police officers, to a Violence Against Women Act.\n\nAs chairman of the Judiciary Committee, then-Sen. Joe Biden drafted the bill, known formally as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 , which was billed by Democrats as a major crackdown on crime.\n\nIn addition to mandatory sentencing for repeat offenders, the bill:\n\nA post on Instagram charges the bill \"bring(s) mass incarceration to black Americans.\"\n\nFor fact-checking purposes, there are two issues at play: whether the bill caused mass incarceration in general and whether it caused mass incarceration to Black Americans.\n\nA 2019 analysis by The Brennan Center for Justice declared the crime bill's legacy \"complicated.\"\n\n\"It contained powerful funding incentives that ensnared more Americans in the ever-widening net of the criminal justice system,\" the study said. \"But many of its provisions also protected communities and victims of crimes, like an assault weapons ban and protections for women in abusive relationships.\"\n\n\"Overall, though, the law is now seen by many as a major driver of mass incarceration. For that reason, policymakers who played a role in pushing it forward, including presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden, have been attacked for supporting it.\"\n\nLauren-Brooke Eisen, director of the Justice Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy think tank, says one of the most significant and long-lasting impacts of the legislation was the enticement to states to build or expand correctional facilities through the Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing Incentive Grants Program.\n\n\"Many states were already building new prisons, but the federal money incentivized the prison construction boom,\" Eisen told USA TODAY. \"These federal funding streams, beginning in the 1960s, reflect the federal government's role in spurring states towards more punitive criminal justice measures. The funding encouraged states and cities to increase arrests, prosecutions, and incarceration, playing a tremendously powerful part in growing the size and scope of our correctional system.\"\n\nThe bill earmarked $8.7 billion over six years for states to build more prisons. About half of the money was available to states that enacted \"truth-in-sentencing,\" or TIS, laws, which cut back on paroles and required people convicted of violent crimes to serve at least 85% of their sentences.\n\nBy 1998, 27 states and the District of Columbia met the TIS criteria for the grant program, according to the Justice Department . Eleven states adopted truth-in-sentencing laws in 1995,  Another 13 adopted them for \"certain offenders to serve a specific percent of their sentence.\"\n\nUnder the TIS laws, violent offenders admitted to prison in 1996 would spend an average of 88 months in prisons, the DOJ report said.\n\nA 2012 Pew Center study of 36 states found that the average length of stay for offenders released from prison in 2009 had increased 36% from 1990, with nine states reporting increases of over 50%.\n\nBut TIS was generally implemented at a time when violent offending was decreasing, according to a 2002 study by the Urban Institute's Justice Policy Center.\n\n\"Were the sentencing practices of 1996 to persist during a time when the number of violent offenses increases, the impacts on prison populations and corrections management could be dramatic,\" the study found.\n\nMarc Mauer, executive director of The Sentencing Project, a campaign to end life imprisonment, told USA TODAY that the 1994 crime bill certainly encouraged the use of expanded incarceration by providing funding to the states for prison construction. But he added that \"mass incarceration was already well under way prior to the adoption of that legislation.\"\n\n\"There are a variety of factors that influence prison populations,\" he said. \"So while it is clear that the 1994 bill did not accelerate the growth of prisons, it's at least possible that this growth would have been more modest had the federal funding not been in place.\"\n\nStephen Ross Johnson, of Knoxville, Tennessee, a board member of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and past president of the Tennessee Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, told USA TODAY that it is \"over simplistic\" to say the 1994 crime bill led to mass incarceration.\n\nAsked if the bill caused or largely contributed to it, Johnson says: \"The bottom line answer to that is no. Was it a link in the chain? Yes. Is it the beginning of the chain? No.\"\n\nJohnson argues that the roots of mass incarceration can be found in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with legislation that created, among other things, the RICO statute, which broadened the scope of federal law as the war on drugs began to take shape.\n\nThe veteran criminal defense attorney, who founded the Tennessee Innocence Project,  contends that mass incarceration also got a boost from a series of bills in the 1980s that created presumptive detention for federal arrestees.\n\nThat, he says, essentially made bail nonexistent in the federal judicial system. That 1980s legislation also created mandatory minimum penalties for drug offenses in the federal system and federal sentencing guidelines designed to promote uniformity but at the cost of higher penalty ranges.\n\n\"People that are poor and of color ended up (under sentencing guidelines) with much higher sentences,\" Johnson says.\n\nThe term \"mass incarceration\" is relative. From 1980-94, the nation's prison population more than doubled on a per capita basis, from 139 prisoners per 100,000 American residents to 387, according to the federal government's Bureau of Justice Statistics for 1994 .\n\nIn 1980 alone, state and federal prisons posted a 12% increase in the number of inmates, with an average yearly increase between 1980 and 1994 of 8.7%. In 1989, the federal and state inmate population swelled by a whopping 13.5% as 84,764 new inmates joined the prison ranks.\n\nBy contrast, from 1994 - the year the crime bill was passed - to 1995, the inmate population increased by 6.7%. The annual increase then dropped steadily for the next six years, from 5.1% between 1995-96 to 1.1% between 2000-01.\n\n\"During 2000, the prison population rose at the lowest rate since 1972 and had the smallest absolute increase since 1980,\" the BJS study said.\n\nRegarding mass incarceration of Black Americans, the issue plays out against the reality of longstanding racial disparities in imprisonment rates.\n\nIn 1993, according to the BJS , the incarceration rate of Black people at the state and federal levels was seven times that of whites. At the end of 1993, there were 1,471 Black inmates per 100,000 Black U.S. residents, compared to 207 white inmates per 100,000 white residents. In 2011, the proportions were roughly the same, with 478 white males in prison for every 100,000 white males in the general population, and 3,023 Black males in prison for every 100,000 Black males in the population.\n\nAny increase in the overall prison population would automatically translate into a larger number of Black inmates, even if the Black percentage of the inmate population stayed the same.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Justice Statistics bulletin Prisoners in 2002, the total number of sentenced inmates under state or federal jurisdiction rose 27% between 1995 and 2002 - from 1,585,586 inmates to 2,033,331 - but reflected \"only small changes in the racial and Hispanic composition of the inmate population.\"\n\nIn 1995, among inmates with sentences of more than one year, white people accounted for 33.5% of prisoners under state or federal jurisdiction, while in 2002 they were 34.2%. Black prisoners in 1995 accounted for 45.7% of prisoners, and in 2002 accounted for 45.1%.\n\nWhile the difference is stark, it is less than in the previous 13 years. Between 1980-93, the percentage of sentenced inmates who were Black rose from 46.5% to 50.8%.\n\nA report on \"Racial Disparity in U.S. Imprisonment across States and Over Time,\" published in the Journal of Quantitative Criminology in 2019, found that a large increase in Black imprisonment is traceable in many states to the crack epidemic in the mid-1980s.\n\nThis disparity, the report says, began to ease starting in the 1990s.\n\n\"Whatever its other effects, this suggests that the 1994 crime bill did not aggravate the preexisting racial disparity in imprisonment,\" the report said.\n\nThe question of any link between the crime bill and mass incarceration took on political implications with Biden's presidential candidacy.\n\nIn 2019, Biden, speaking in New Hampshire, rejected charges that the 1994 crime bill spurred mass incarceration.\n\n\"Folks, let's get something straight, 90/92 of every 100 prisoners behind the bars is in state prison, not a federal prison,\" he said, according to the Washington Post . \"This idea that the crime bill generated mass incarceration, it did not generate mass incarceration.\"\n\nBiden's disclaimers were somewhat undercut in 2016, when former President Bill Clinton, who championed the original bill, told the NAACP \"there were longer sentences\" spelled out in the legislation.\n\n\"And most of these people are in prison under state law, but the federal law set a trend,\" Clinton said . \"And that was overdone. We were wrong about that. That percentage of it, we were wrong about.\"\n\nIt was perhaps noteworthy that the former president's mea culpa came before a critical audience of Black Americans at a time when Hillary Clinton was running for president.\n\nOur research finds that while the crime bill did increase the prison population in states, it did not bring about a mass incarceration relative to earlier years. Rather, it coincided with a slowdown in the annual grown of the state and federal prison population. Nor did it bring about mass incarceration of Black people, compared to before the bill was passed. We rate this claim as FALSE.\n\nContributing: Jamie Satterfield, Knoxville News Sentinel\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

      "text": "Fact check: Hillary Clinton, not Joe Biden, used the phrase 'super predators'\n\nThe Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, also known as the crime bill, was the most comprehensive piece of anti-crime legislation in American history. Drafted by then-Sen. Joe Biden, chairman of the Judiciary Committee , the bill was the government's response to a 1991 peak in crime rates.\n\nThe nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice reported 5,856 crimes were committed per 100,000 people that year. Violent crime was also highest at 716 crimes per 100,000 people.\n\nThe bill earmarked $9.7 billion in funding for prisons and $6.1 billion for preventative programs, featured a federal assault weapons ban, expanded the federal death penalty and provided for 100,000 new police officers, according to government transparency website, GovTrack . The bill was signed into law by President Bill Clinton after passing through Congress with mostly Democratic support and achieving near-unanimous approval in the Senate, according to its website.\n\nBut aside from historic policy changes, the bill's passage ushered a new phrase into the public conscious: \"super predator.\"\n\nDuring the last presidential debate on Oct. 22, President Donald Trump accused Democratic presidential nominee Biden of describing Black people as \"super predators.\"\n\n\"He never did a thing except in 1994, when he did such harm to the Black community. And they were called, and he called them, super predators,\" Trump said of Biden's history with the Black community, according to a transcript.\n\nThat night, Facebook user Christina Smith posted about the phrase and its relationship to the crime bill.\n\n\"1994 CRIME BILL Biden called Black people SUPER PREDATORS!!!!\" she wrote.\n\nDespite Trump's words, Smith told USA TODAY she got the information from another source. She also alluded to her support for Trump.\n\n\"Y'all lie all the time about Trump, and NEVER FACT CHECK WHEN THE POST LIE ABOUT TRUMP,\" Smith wrote.\n\nThe term \"super predator\" was coined in 1995 by Princeton University professor John DiIulio. It came to define a generation of \"radically impulsive, brutally remorseless youngsters, including ever more preteenage boys, who murder, assault, rape, rob, burglarize, deal deadly drugs, join gun-toting gangs and create serious communal disorders,'' according to a 2001 report by the New York Times. DiIulio has said he regrets inventing a theory that \"took on a life of its own.\"\n\nTrump accused Biden of labeling members of the Black community with the phrase, but this is inaccurate.\n\nWhile Biden did warn of \"predators\" during a 1993 speech advocating for the crime bill, he did not refer to Black people as \"super predators.\"\n\n\"Unless we do something about that cadre of young people - tens of thousands of them born out of wedlock, without parents, without supervision, without any structure, without any conscious developing - because they literally have not been socialized, they literally have not had an opportunity ... we should focus on them now. If we don't, they will - or a portion of them will - become the predators 15 years from now,\" Biden said, according to a video recording provided by C-SPAN.\n\nIn fact, Hillary Clinton, not Biden, is responsible for linking \"super predator\" to the 1994 bill.\n\nDuring a 1996 campaign speech for President Bill Clinton, the then-first lady used the term to describe \"gangs\" of kids without empathy, while crediting the crime bill's allowance for more police officers for a reduction in crime, gangs and drugs.\n\n\"We need to take these people on, they are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators. No conscious, no empathy,\" Clinton said, according to a video recording provided by C-SPAN.\n\nThe term resurfaced during the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, when then-candidate Clinton endured criticism for her support of the bill, USA TODAY reported .\n\nThe scrutiny continued into the 2020 election cycle.\n\nNeither Clinton nor Biden singled out the Black community in their speeches. Still, the crime bill has been criticized for disproportionately affecting minority communities. Biden called a provision of the bill relating to drug offenses a mistake during Thursday's presidential debate, per a transcript.\n\nWe rate this claim FALSE, based on our research. Biden did not refer to members of the Black community as \"super predators\" during or after the passage of the 1994 crime bill. First lady Hillary Clinton associated the phrase with the bill, two years after it was signed, but Black people were not directly referenced.\n\nThank you for supporting our journa lism.

      "text": "Donald Trump is wrong again: Joe Biden was right on crime in 1994\n\nDuring last week's presidential debate , both Donald Trump and Joe Biden frequently shifted from answering direct questions posed by moderator Kristen Welker to criticizing their opponent. Although a common tactic in political confrontations, Trump's race to pivot on the matter of race not only revealed his own lack of empathy for Black Americans, but rehashed an overused allegation that Biden is to blame for mass incarceration, particularly of Black people.\n\nWelker: \"I would like you to speak directly to these (Black) families. Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?\"\n\nTrump: \"Yes, I do. And again, he's (Biden) been in government 47 years. He never did a thing, except in 1994, when he did such harm to the Black community. And they were called ... and he called them super predators. And he said that, he said it, super predators. And they can never live that down. 1994, your crime bill, the super predators.\"\n\nIt is true that Biden has been in public service for nearly five decades , as the U.S. senator from Delaware from 1973 until 2009 followed by eight years as vice president. At no time, however, did he have ultimate authority to block legislation or sign executive orders like Trump has done as occupant of the Oval Office.\n\nSpecifically, in terms of the 1994 crime bill, Biden was but one of 61 senators who supported the legislation .\n\nChairing the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time , Biden did indeed have a major hand in guiding the crime bill through Congress and onto President Bill Clinton's desk for his signature. As in the sausage-making metaphor often applied to lawmaking, the chairman had to strike many compromises for this massive piece of legislation to get a sufficient support from members of Congress, with their widely divergent opinions of the causes and solutions to crime.\n\nAccording to the 1994 Congressional Quarterly Almanac, \"The struggle over the bill, which lasted most of the session, was a fierce match between conservatives - who fought for stiffer punishment for criminals and ridiculed prevention programs as pork - and liberals - who condemned what they said was a failed policy of overzealous incarceration, and pushed instead for crime prevention programs.\"\n\nIf Biden had had his way, the crime bill would have been far more oriented toward prevention and far less toward punishment. As early as 1990, with the nation's homicide rate reaching close to historic levels, Biden talked of the three Ds - deadly weapons, drugs and demographics . Reflecting Biden's influence, the final version of the crime bill included over $7 billion for a basket of prevention programs. However, once Republicans seized control of Congress following the 1994 midterm elections, it became more like a trash basket of prevention.\n\nTrump vs. Biden: Opinion contributors assess the final presidential debate\n\nThe Republican \"Contract with America\" shifted crime control priorities - and how the funds were appropriated - away from early prevention over to harsh punishment. In 1995, the Republicans slashed drug treatment and other prevention initiatives in favor of prison financing and incentivizing states to enact tougher sentencing laws. It had become a political liability to advocate for prevention.\n\nIt was also in 1995 that political scientist John DiIulio coined the rather inappropriate term \"super predator.\" Not only was it a characterization never used by Biden (but was used in 1996 by the Republican standard-bearer Bob Dole and by then-first lady Hillary Clinton ), the term also could not logically have encouraged passage of the crime bill in 1994.\n\nPresidential debate: Donald Trump lies like a rug; Joe Biden fails to step all over it\n\nFor the most part, it is unfair to judge actions of long ago using a present-day lens. Crime rates in the early 1990s were soaring, with the violent crime rate in the four years leading up to the passage of the crime bill about twice as high as it is today . Amidst the surge, the public was scared, responding to daily stories of crime in the streets that could often seem as grim as current news reports on the coronavirus.\n\nBiden has admitted that certain elements of the crime bill were ill advised, willingly accepting a share of responsibility for mass incarceration traced to actions from decades ago. Taking responsibility and admitting a mistake is admirable - something not seen from President Trump for his actions (or rather inactions) of months ago that are at least in part responsible for mass infections.\n\nJames Alan Fox is the Lipman Professor of Criminology, Law and Public Policy at Northeastern University, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and co-author of \" The Will to Kill: Making Sense of Senseless Murder .\" Follow him on Twitter: @jamesalanfox"

      "text": "Fact check: Bill Clinton and the 1994 crime bill\n\nBill Clinton overstated the effect of the crime bill he signed in 1994 when he said, \"because of that bill we had a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in the murder rate.\" Independent analyses have found that the bill had a modest effect on crime rates.\n\nClinton offered his defense of the bill in response to a protester at a campaign event for Hillary Clinton in Philadelphia on April 7. In addition to Clinton's inflated assessment of the bill's effect on crime, we found fault with how both sides portrayed the crime bill in Clinton's back-and-forth with the protester:\n\n• The protester clearly yelled something about the \"three-strikes\" provision in the 1994 crime bill. Some in the Black Lives Matter movement have blamed that provision for mass incarceration. But that overstates the effect of the bill, as the steady trend toward increased incarceration long pre-dated the 1994 bill.\n\n• Clinton responded by saying \"90% of the people in prison too long are in state prisons and local jails,\" not federal prisons. But that claim - meant to deflect responsibility for mass incarceration - goes too far in the other direction. The bill did include $8.7 billion for prison construction for states that enacted \"truth-in-sentencing\" laws, which required people convicted of violent crimes to serve at least 85% of their sentences.\n\nThe law at issue was the sweeping Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 , which provided funding for tens of thousands of community police officers and drug courts, banned certain assault weapons, and mandated life sentences for criminals convicted of a violent felony after two or more prior convictions, including drug crimes. The mandated life sentences were known as the \"three-strikes\" provision.\n\nThe law is blamed by some for rising incarceration rates, though as we will explain later, that trend actually began in the 1970s. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders - who voted for the 1994 crime bill - has frequently noted on the campaign trail, correctly, that the U.S. has, by far, the largest prison population in the world (though we have noted that his promise to correct that dubious distinction in his first term would be an almost impossibly tall order).\n\nIn a speech at an NAACP convention in Philadelphia in July, Clinton acknowledged that tougher incarceration provisions in the bill were a mistake. \"I signed a bill that made the problem worse,\" Clinton said. \"And I want to admit it.\"\n\nAlthough Hillary Clinton was not in the Senate at the time and did not vote on the bill, she spoke in favor of it at the time . Asked about the law during a Democratic debate on March 6, Hillary Clinton said that \"there were some aspects that worked well\" including violence against women provisions, but she allowed that other portions related to increasing incarceration \"were a mistake.\"\n\nHillary Clinton also has been criticized for using the term \"super predator\" in 1996 to describe kids with \"no conscience, no empathy,\" though it is a phrase she has since said she regrets using.\n\nThat was the context of the exchange between the protester and Bill Clinton on April 7.\n\nThe protester can be heard yelling something about \"three strikes.\" The Philadelphia Inquirer noted that the woman also held a sign that read, \"Clinton crime bill destroyed our communities!\"\n\nHere's how the former president responded:\n\nBill Clinton, April 7 : \"What she's referring to are the increased sentencing provisions of the 1994 crime bill. Ninety percent of the people in prison too long are in state prisons and local jails, more than 90%. But it's also true that there are too many people in the state prisons, I mean the federal prisons. President Obama is trying to let them out. Here's what happened. Let's just tell the whole story. ...\n\n\"Here's what happened. Vice President Biden, you guys know Vice President Biden, whose family comes from Scranton. He was the chairman of the committee that had jurisdiction over this crime bill. I had an assault weapons ban in it. I had money for inner-city kids for out-of-school activities. We had 110,000 police officers, so we could put people on the street, not in these military vehicles, and the police would look like the people they were policing. We did all of that.\n\n\"And Biden said, 'You can't pass this bill, the Republicans will kill it if you don't put more sentencing in.' I talked to a lot of African American groups. They thought black lives mattered. They said, 'Take this bill because our kids are being shot in the streets by gangs.' We had 13-year-old kids planning their own funerals.\n\n\"She doesn't want to hear any of that. (Clinton said, pointing at the protester.) You know what else she doesn't want to hear, because of that bill we had a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in the murder rate. And listen to this, because of that and the background check law we had a 46-year low in the deaths of people by gun violence. And who do you think those lives were that mattered. Whose lives were saved that mattered?\"\n\nWe'll start with Clinton's inflated claim that \"because of that bill we had a 25-year low in crime, a 33-year low in the murder rate.\"\n\nCrime did drop in the years after the bill passed, as Clinton said, but he gives too much credit to the crime bill for that. Experts who have studied the impact of the law say forces independent of the law were mostly responsible for the crime drop.\n\nA Government Accountability Office report in 2005 estimated that the 1994 crime bill resulted in 88,000 additional police officers between 1994 and 2001, and that the influx of new police officers resulted in \"modest\" drop in crime.\n\nThe GAO concluded that between 1993 and 2000 the Community Oriented Policing Services(COPS) funds \"contributed to a 1.3 percent decline in the overall crime rate and a 2.5 percent decline in the violent crime rate from the 1993 levels.\" Still, the GAO concluded, \"Factors other than COPS funds accounted for the majority of the decline in crime during this period.\"\n\nWhat were those other factors? Increased employment, better policing methods, an aging of the population, growth in income and inflation, to name a few.\n\n\"He (Clinton) may be able to claim some credit, but the jury is very much still out on this,\" John Worrall, a professor of criminology at the University of Texas at Dallas, told us via email. \"Criminologists and economists are in no agreement as to the causes of the crime declines we've seen. Could be economic, demographic, a civilizing effect, possibly because of abortion or lead paint, tougher sentences, etc., etc. A dozen or more explanations have been offered and no one agrees.\"\n\nWorrall co-authored research published in the journal Criminology in 2007 that concluded, \"COPS spending had little to no effect on crime.\" But he cautioned, \"Ours is one voice in a crowd. Some have found no effect. I am comfortable saying modest effect. It could not have hurt to strengthen the police presence.\"\n\n\"Crime did go down through the 1990s, but nobody has shown that any of the 1994 or 1996 federal legislation was a significant cause,\" Frank Zimring , a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who is an expert in crime trends, told us via email.\n\nAs for the effect of the law's increased incarceration provisions, they had little effect on reducing crime according to reports we reviewed. A 2014 report on the growth of incarceration in the United States by the National Research Council concluded, \"The increase in incarceration may have caused a decrease in crime, but the magnitude is highly uncertain and the results of most studies suggest it was unlikely to have been large.\"\n\nA study by the Brennan Center for Justice in 2015 found that, \"Incarceration has been declining in effectiveness as a crime control tactic since before 1980. Since 2000, the effect of increasing incarceration on the crime rate has been essentially zero.\"\n\nThe protester's complaint assumes, of course, that the 1994 crime bill was a major contributor to mass incarceration that hit the black community particularly hard. But experts say that puts too much blame on the 1994 bill.\n\nThe trend toward increased incarceration began in the early 1970s, and quadrupled in the ensuing four decades. A two-year study by the National Research Council concluded that the increase was historically unprecedented, that the U.S. far outpaced the incarceration rates elsewhere in the world, and that high incarceration rates have disproportionately affected Hispanic and black communities. The report cited policies enacted by officials at all levels that expanded the use of incarceration, largely in response to decades of rising crime.\n\n\"In the 1970s, the numbers of arrests and court caseloads increased, and prosecutors and judges became harsher in their charging and sentencing,\" the report states. \"In the 1980s, convicted defendants became more likely to serve prison time.\"\n\nIndeed, this trend continued with tough-on-crime policies through the 1990s as well, but to lay the blame for the incarceration trend entirely, or even mostly, at the feet of the 1994 crime bill ignores the historical trend.\n\n\"The trend of increased incarceration had already started two decades before 1994,\" Jeremy Travis, the president of the John Jay College of Justice in New York, told The New York Times . Travis led federal research on crime during the Clinton administration and was an editor of the National Research Council report.\n\nBut that doesn't mean it didn't have any effect. Experts told us the law exacerbated the trend. And so Clinton's defense that \"90 percent of the people in prison too long are in state prisons and local jails,\" rather than federal prisons, is a bit misleading. It suggests the law only affected federal prisons, and that's not accurate.\n\nThe bill included a federal \"three-strikes\" provision which required mandatory life imprisonment without possibility of parole for those who commit federal violent felonies if they had two or more previous convictions for violent felonies or drug trafficking crimes. In his mea culpa in August , Clinton said that while most people are in prison under state law, \"the federal law set a trend.\"\n\nThe bill also had a more direct impact on state prison populations. It included $8.7 billion for prison construction to states that passed \"truth-in-sentencing\" laws requiring that people convicted of violent crimes serve at least 85% of their sentences. The New York Times at the time noted that those convicted of violent crimes served \"55 percent of their sentences,\" citing Justice Department data.\n\nAccording to the Department of Justice , 11 states adopted truth-in-sentencing laws in 1995, one year after passage of the crime bill. By 1998, 27 states and the District of Columbia met the eligibility criteria for the truth-in-sentencing grants. Another 13 states adopted truth-in-sentencing for \"certain offenders to serve a specific percent of their sentence.\"\n\nSo while it may go too far to blame the 1994 crime bill for mass incarceration, it did create incentives for states to build prisons and increase sentences, and thereby contributed to increased incarceration."

      "text": "Joe Biden, Black voters made you president. It's time to right wrongs on criminal justice.\n\nThe story of the 2020 election is that Black voters came through for President-elect Joe Biden.\n\nWhen Biden's primary campaign was written off by many, Black voters of South Carolina handed him a big win. Biden's strength with African Americans helped him to secure the Democratic Party's nomination.\n\nThis week, Black voters in Detroit, Philadelphia and Atlanta have determined the outcome of our presidential election. It's striking that people who have been failed and treated the worst by our democracy (and by extension our criminal justice system) consistently do the most to save it.\n\nIt is high time for Biden and the Democratic Party to deliver justice for African Americans and other communities of color that are disproportionately discarded and forgotten within the justice system.\n\nOur justice system is rooted in racism, and African Americans have been hit hardest by it. Still, the Black voters had huge turnouts in cities Democrats needed to be competitive.\n\nLast year, when Biden spoke on criminal justice issues, he admitted: \"I know we haven't always gotten things right,\" surely referring, in part, to the 1994 crime bill that he supported and that is often blamed for today's mass incarceration problem.\n\nUntil recently, candidates running for president competed to look tough on crime and paint their opponents as soft. But 2020 has been different.\n\nThe downfalls of our criminal justice system have been exposed for all to see, from the police killings of George Floyd (a Black man who was taken out by a police officer who put a knee on his neck) and Breonna Taylor (a Black woman shot to death by police in her own home) to the deaths of jailed Americans before they even had their day in court.\n\nThe United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, a result of decades of bipartisan legislation - like the 1994 crime bill - that propped up institutional racism. About 2.3 million people are locked up in jails and prisons, and 40% of those locked up are Black Americans (who are 13% of society).\n\nAmerican mass incarceration is a human rights catastrophe.\n\nBiden, fortunately, has evolved on this issue.\n\nIn 2007, before becoming President Barack Obama's vice president, Biden sponsored the Second Chance Act , which provides services to formerly incarcerated individuals and has gone a long way toward lowering the recidivism rate. As a senator, Biden also supported the full elimination of the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine.\n\nYoung Black voters who did not back Biden in the Democratic primaries are the same Black youth who are protesting in the streets right now, who hold his political record as responsible for the pain they are feeling, and rightfully so.\n\nAs president, it's his duty to right those wrongs, and do right by the community that garnered his White House victory.\n\nAmerica needs a bold agenda that goes further than small reforms or hollow public relations moves.\n\nThe Biden administration must enlarge their field of vision. Rather than focusing on the problems of the institution and asking what needs to be changed, they must raise radical questions about the existence of these institutions to begin with.\n\nWhat principles underpin the founding and evolution of the police, the courts and our prisons? Do those principles bend toward justice, or cause suffering and harm?\n\nA strong first step would be to support the BREATHE Act . This proposed legislation would eliminate the federal government's ability to give multimillion dollar grants for the militarization of police forces, and calls for a \"time-bound plan\" to close all federal immigration detention centers. The Federal Bureau of Prisons' pandemic response has demonstrated a lack of regard for basic humanity that has created deadly conditions for those who are incarcerated.\n\nInstead of a punishment paradigm, the BREATHE Act creates a new community public safety agency, which uses grants to replace the harmful criminal legal systems locally with evidence-based public safety infrastructure. Importantly, the act moves the function of public safety surrounding the war on drugs out of the Department of Justice and into the Department of Health and Human Services - signaling a dramatic shift in how our society approaches community well-being.\n\nThe investments that the BREATHE Act makes - in education, health care, the environment, wealth generation for working class families and housing - creates public safety by supporting communities rather than punishing them.\n\nIf you truly want people to participate in society, you do not pass laws that keep them from doing so. More than 6 million people are not allowed to vote today due to a felony conviction, something the BREATHE Act would immediately change if passed.\n\nWe need to create space for budgets to be divested from police and prisons and invested directly into communities to address mental health needs, homelessness, access to critical education and rewarding jobs as well as community-based methods of accountability.\n\nWe know that prisons won't be bulldozed tomorrow, and the complete elimination of the justice system can't be done in one fell swoop. But in the meantime, people need to continue to confront the criminal justice system and face the harm of incarceration.\n\nWe are calling for the Biden administration to fundamentally shift their thinking and approach to make it possible for all communities to be safe and free.\n\nAshish Prashar is a justice reform campaigner who sits on the boards of the Exodus Transitional Community , Getting Out and Staying Out , Leap Confronting Conflict and the Responsible Business Initiative for Justice .

      "text": "Joe Biden reduced murders, reformed criminal justice policy and made America safer\n\nWhen someone has been in public life as long as Joe Biden , critics and challengers on the campaign trail have ample material to pick apart for political advantage. There is no doubt that during his nearly half-century in Congress and the White House, Biden has made his share of blunders and faux pas, the majority of which were relatively minor or even humorous.\n\nHowever, recent allegations that Biden bears responsibility for the nation's mass incarceration problem is not only inaccurate, but downright insulting to a man who has distinguished himself as one of the most progressive federal lawmakers in terms of criminal justice policy.\n\nThe years leading up to the much-discussed 1994 Crime Bill were challenging, to say the least, with violent crime rates soaring to record levels. From 1990 through 1993 , for example, nearly 100,000 Americans were murdered, two-thirds by guns, more than in any other similar time span, before or after. Something had to be done, and Biden had the political will and skill to translate good ideas into effective policy.\n\nDon't underestimate Joe Biden. He knows what America needs and how to get it done.\n\nTrump-era America needs Biden's campaign even if he doesn't win the Democratic nomination\n\nJoe Biden's 2020 nightmare: He could be the Democratic reincarnation of Jeb Bush\n\nAs early as 1990, Biden, as c hair of the Senate Judiciary Committee , recognized and responded to the growing crisis by holding hearings on the nation's homicide epidemic. In his introductory remarks , he talked of the 3-Ds - deadly weapons, drugs and demographics.\n\nBiden's observations were spot on. The surge in homicide at that time was exclusively among teens and young adults, completely gun-related, and linked to the emerging crack cocaine markets in major cities from New York to Los Angeles. While the subsequent concern for sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine was legitimate, it was crack, not powder, that drove the crime surge some three decades ago .\n\nBiden's approach was clearly more preventative than punitive. At the 1990 hearing , for example, he called for investing in drug education for youth and drug treatment for addicts. In contrast, Sen. Alan Spector, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, argued instead for tougher prosecution and expanding the death penalty.\n\nWhile it is true that Biden had a major hand in crafting the Crime Bill, his was not the only one, as passage of the massive piece of legislation required bipartisan support and thus much compromise.\n\nReflecting Biden's influence, the final version of the Crime Bill included over $7 billion for a basket of prevention programs . However, once Republicans took control of Congress in the 1994 midterms, it became more like a trash basket of prevention.\n\nThe Republican \" Contract with America \" set a new path, shifting the emphasis from early prevention to harsh punishment. The Contract promised \"an anti-crime package including stronger truth-in-sentencing, 'good faith' exclusionary rule exemptions, effective death penalty provisions, and cuts in social spending from this summer's 'crime' bill to fund prison construction and additional law enforcement to keep people secure in their neighborhoods and kids safe in their schools.\" It had become a political liability to advocate prevention.\n\nWhatever share of responsibility that Biden may own for the growth in prison populations over the next decade or more, he should be praised for his central role in pushing legislation that saved thousands of lives. He was instrumental in helping to get the Brady Law through Congress, after which the nation's rate of gun homicide started its long-term slide . He was the chief proponent and author of the Violence Against Women Act , an initiative that helped lower the rate of women murdered by their intimate partners by more than 25% in subsequent years.\n\nThe streets of American cities are much safer today than a quarter-century ago before wide-ranging changes in federal crime control policy were enacted. Taken together, Joe Biden deserves credit, not criticism, for all that he has done throughout this career to reduce the number of crime victims and for providing assistance to those unfortunate to become one.\n\nJames Alan Fox is the Lipman Professor of Criminology, Law and Public Policy at Northeastern University, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors and co-author of \" The Will to Kill: Making Sense of Senseless Murder .\" Follow him on Twitter: @jamesalanfox"

      "text": "The complicated legacy of the 1994 crime bill\n\nManage your account\n\nIn the 1990s, national politicians painted a scary picture of crime in the United States.\n\n\"We have predators on our streets that society has ... in part because of its neglect, created,\" then-U.S. Sen. Joe Biden said in a 1993 speech.\n\n\"They are beyond the pale, many of those people, beyond the pale,\" he continued. \"It's a sad commentary on society. We have no choice but to take them out of society, and the truth is we don't very well know how to rehabilitate them at that point. That's the sad truth.\"\n\nIn 1991, the country's violent crime rate had reached a peak of 758.2 reported crimes per 100,000 residents. (For context, the FBI reported a rate of 380.7 violent crimes per 100,000 people in 2022.)\n\nBiden became a prominent voice on this issue and played a key role in drafting the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, signed by President Bill Clinton 30 years ago this month. The 356-page bill tackled assault weapons, domestic violence, incarceration and policing. Today, it's a complicated part of Biden's legacy.\n\nThe bill was celebrated by many advocates for enacting the Violence Against Women's Act, the first comprehensive federal legislative package explicitly designed to end gender-based violence.\n\nBut it also faced wide criticism for expanding policing and harsh criminal punishments that fell hardest on Black and Brown communities. Often overlooked is the effect it had on arrests and incarceration of children and the rise of the school-to-prison pipeline. From 1990 to 2000, the proportion of children convicted of murder who were sentenced to life without parole increased from 2.9 percent to 9 percent .\n\nThe 19th interviewed nearly two dozen experts - several of whom were directly involved in drafting or negotiating the bill 30 years ago - about its legacy. They shared their perspective on where the country was before the bill passed, where we are now and where we should head next.\n\nU.S. Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, a member of Congress since 1993: The Democratic Party was trying to toughen its political image on the crime. The fact is, most of the members were taking an emotional approach to crime, totally unrelated to any evidence and research.\n\nEd Chung, vice president of initiatives at Vera Institute of Justice : Mass incarceration overall has been a decades-long endeavor across the United States, and it started before the '94 crime bill. But in the early 1990s, crime was the national issue of the day at all levels of government. There was a dramatic increase in crime rates in the 1980s and it peaked in the early '90s. And so policymakers were looking to address that through legislation.\n\nKristin Henning, Blume Professor of Law and Director of the Juvenile Justice Clinic and Initiative at Georgetown Law: It really starts in the '60s with the civil rights era and kids protesting. So really from the '60s right through the '80s, the '90s, we sort of began to flow into this \"law and order\" response to children. There was a sense that young people were largely responsible for or had an outsized role to play in the increase in crime. I think by the time we get to the '90s, people were much more explicit that [they believed] Black children were responsible.\n\nVictoria Nourse, a Georgetown University law professor and vice chair of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, who drafted the Violence Against Women Act as a legal staffer in the U.S. Senate : We had hearings in June of 1990 where three very brave hidden figures - no one remembers who they were - talked about being raped. The Senate Judiciary Committee at that time had never heard anything like that. But Biden treated them with great respect and could still quote the women in 2015 when I went to work for him in the White House. The law was denying the truth of their sexual assaults, it was blaming the victims, and this was something that clearly moved him.\n\nSally Goldfarb, a professor at Rutgers Law School who was a staff attorney at NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund : I was an attorney working primarily on family law issues back then, and I saw that family violence is a crucial issue in the lives of women and in this country. You can't really talk about American families without talking about domestic violence. That was not a widely shared view - there was a lot of denial.\n\nNourse : I did not let the other drafters near [the VAWA draft] because I was worried - they were all guys. And then I started bringing in the interest groups, I needed expertise. I had taken Ruth Bader Ginsburg off the shelf, and I remember having a meeting with a lead battered women's group and I felt like they themselves had been battered. I asked them what their wishlist was, and they didn't think anyone would care. The last time they went up to Congress, they'd gotten trashed. They didn't know who Biden was or why he'd care, but they liked me, so I developed relationships.\n\nGoldfarb : [Nourse] called me to have a conversation about then-Sen. Biden's idea for a bill to address violence against women. I ended up getting very excited and very involved. I founded a national coalition of individuals and organizations that worked together to make recommendations on the drafting of the bill and also to work on mobilizing support inside and outside of Congress.\n\nNourse : It was really the NOW Legal Defense Fund, they're called Legal Momentum now, but Sally Goldfarb - she was the real force behind the force of Biden.\n\nGoldfarb : [Nourse] was on the inside; I was on the outside. It was the first time that the federal government was proposing to take a fairly comprehensive look at violence against women and its impact on women's equality in status in society. In the past, these issues either had not been addressed at all or were addressed through state criminal law or a few federal funding programs that were very modest.\n\nNourse : At the time, battered women's shelters claimed that their major source of funding was bake sales. And there were people on the floor of the Senate in the '80s who say that battered women's shelters were indoctrination centers for radical feminism or runaway wives.\n\nGoldfarb : There was significant pushback to the idea that government should get involved in protecting women from violence, particularly violence committed by intimate partners. There were people who thought that family issues should be kept within the family. The national coalition that I founded began with just a dozen people sitting around a table in the very modest conference room at the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund. By the time the bill was enacted four years later, there were literally hundreds of organizations and individuals who had pledged their support for this legislation, ranging from the Girl Scouts to religious denominations to health care providers, community groups, civil rights organizations.\n\nNourse : VAWA was first introduced in 1990 but it didn't become popular until 1992, the \"year of the woman.\" It was after Anita Hill's hearings and public sexual harassment allegations against Supreme Court Justice nominee Clarence Thomas, and a record-number of women were elected to the Senate.\n\nGoldfarb : There were a series of hearings held on the Violence Against Women Act. At hearings held in different states by different senators, the mainstream press carried stories about the testimony given by women who had been shot by their husbands or attacked by their landlord or victimized in other ways. The impact that it had on their lives, the impact it had on their financial well-being as they lost their jobs and fled from abusive relationships. People were now reading stories about issues that might not have previously come to their attention. So VAWA became a vehicle for public education.\n\nOne of the major innovations of the Violence Against Women Act was to think about these issues in terms of their effect across social categories and not see this as an individual perpetrator and an individual victim alone, but rather as part of a social pattern.\n\nNourse: Advocates at first weren't happy that VAWA was part of a crime bill. And the ACLU opposed VAWA at the time because they thought it was racist. They thought it would put more Black men in jail. My answer was, \"Well, what about the Black women who are the survivors?\" It was a day and age when liberals thought that anything that involved crime was racist, and, you know, there is a fine line. Crime had been used by the Republicans to race bait for a very, very long time. But where were the Black women?\n\nHernandez Stroud, a senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law: The Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) supported the idea of addressing crime, but members of the CBC were critical of the 1994 bill. There were communities, Black communities, that certainly wanted to address crime, but the question was about the way in which you do that.\n\nAnd so members of the CBC, while criticizing the bill, had also introduced an alternative bill that included investment in prevention and alternatives to incarceration. They devoted $2 billion more to drug treatment and $3 billion more to early intervention programs.\n\nRep. Scott, a member of the CBC: There were a few of us who just decided to follow the evidence and research. That pretty much put us opposed to most of the provisions in the bill. We had initiatives to try to put money into evidence-based approaches that have been shown to actually reduce crime.\n\nBut all the politics is on the side of slogans and sound bites. Slogans polled extremely well, and members of Congress are politicians trying to get elected.\n\nStephanie Love-Patterson, president and chief executive of the National Network to End Domestic Violence: I was working as a sexual assault advocate at one of the hospitals in Chicago back in the 1980s. Oftentimes it takes some time for a change [like the passage of VAWA] to spread throughout communities so that people understand it. But one thing I can say from the sexual assault and domestic violence side, we advocates could more confidently tell victims what they had rights to - and that was really, really good.\n\nRachel Graber, vice president of government relations and advocacy at Jewish Women International, which is part of the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence: VAWA brought together domestic violence programs, sexual assault programs and victim advocates with law enforcement and prosecutors - building a coordinated community response. So instead of having a piecemeal response where no one is talking to each other, the idea was to have a united front with everybody working together. Victims were better protected and offenders held more accountable.\n\nChristian Nunes, president of the National Organization for Women, one of the country's largest feminist advocacy groups: This is the first time you really saw a huge push for guidelines to establish tracking sex offenders. That was very helpful, particularly for women and children, survivors and victims. However, many women victims of trafficking were swept into the crime bill under extreme penalties and given harsh sentences even though they were actually victims . Then we had the sex-abuse-to-prison pipeline that we see has contributed to a lot of mass incarceration for women.\n\nStroud: Although our incarceration was already steadily rising before the crime bill, several of its provisions, to many people, helped to accelerate incarceration. From 1970 to 1994, the rate of imprisonment had exploded 400 percent and from '94 to 2009 - which is when incarceration was at its highest - imprisonment continued to rise, doubling.\n\nSo how did the crime bill contribute to this increase? First, it banned 19 types of semi-automatic assault weapons. It authorized the death penalty for dozens of existing and new crimes. It instituted a federal \"three-strikes-and-you're-out\" provision . But, those facets were likely less pernicious than how the crime bill influenced states to increase their prison roles.\n\nThe bill granted states $12.5 billion to build prisons if they passed \"truth in sentencing\" laws, which required incarcerated people to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences. And so, it was this idea that the federal government was using the power of the purse to engage states in the project of incarcerating ever more people for longer periods of time.\n\nThe way that these policies defined crime, the punishments that they attach to those definitions of crime, fell hardest on communities of color.\n\nI think that is reflected in the glaring racial disparities of our prisons when it comes to those who are behind bars. So there's no doubt that communities of color and low-income communities were suffering disproportionately as a result of many of these policies.\n\nHenning: It had an inordinate, outsized impact on the mass incarceration of Black youth and spawned these draconian provisions all across the country to try more children as adults at younger ages for more crimes instead of helping them in ways that would make all of us safe and would make children safe.\n\nThe 1994 crime bill itself creates the COPS program, the Community Oriented Policing Services program. That is huge at that moment because it's creating the authority for the attorney general's office to create grants to increase the police presence throughout communities. In 1998, the bill got amended to specify that those COPS grants could be used and should be used for schools. So the 1994 bill is so critically important because it paved the foundation for the federal funding of cops in schools.\n\nHenning: It's really critical to understand that the 1994 crime bill literally, unequivocally, in every practical way, shifted the way we police children in schools. The way that this funding has been allocated, schools with a predominantly or disproportionately high presence of Black and Brown students are more likely to have school resource officers than White schools.\n\nWe know this to be true that more police in schools means more arrests of students. More arrests of students means more arrests of Black and Brown students. Data shows that Black girls are 3.6 times more likely to be arrested at school than a White girl. And a Black boy is 2.4 times more likely to be arrested than a White boy.\n\nJuvenile court is supposed to be different, more rehabilitative and confidential. But when you transfer kids to adult court, they are sentenced in adult facilities. We know that sending children to adult facilities radically increases the chance that they're going to be sexually assaulted, physically assaulted by other inmates, by guards.\n\nWe know that they're not going to get the educational support that they need. They're not going to get the mental health support that they need. They're going to learn to adapt to the prison mindset in order to protect themselves. They're more likely to be in solitary confinement.\n\nNikola Nable-Juris, national legal and policy director, Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth: Family members are some of the most compelling and powerful advocates and voices on this issue because they can really speak to how incarcerating a child can tear a family apart and really create so many challenges that people never anticipated, because many children had never encountered the justice system before their arrest. There's the challenges of going through court proceedings, the burden for a parent seeing your child incarcerated, the challenges in prison in terms of communication with family contact, the lack of educational opportunities.\n\nPatrice Sulton, founder and executive director of the DC Justice Lab: What we know about the U.S. approach to policing and the U.S.' approach to the number of people we put into prison and how long we keep them there, is that it is criminogenic - it's actually making crime worse.\n\nIt should have been obvious that if you keep throwing kids up against the wall, if you keep throwing people into jail, at a certain point you will have destabilized a community enough that it cannot thrive. You can't pull all the Black men out of the neighborhood, put them in cages, torture them for years, put them back and expect crime to go down. That's not a winning strategy, although that was the prevailing wisdom at the time.\n\nGoldfarb: VAWA absolutely did not solve all the problems when it passed in 1994, and since then the law has been reauthorized five times. It's been expanded and provisions have been added; the most recent reauthorization in 2022 expanded protections for LGBTQ+ survivors, survivors with disabilities and people living on tribal reservations. It also had important programs to provide housing for victims.\n\nNunes : Over the last few years, we're definitely seeing a better understanding of the complexity of what domestic violence looks like. Before, it was a lot more rigid with the expectation that domestic violence was just your partner or spouse offending you. But now, we're looking at different violence with different gender identities, with different technologies - including artificial intelligence, location tracking, cyber stalking - and considering economic, financial and emotional abuse.\n\nDale Cecka, director of the Family Violence Litigation Clinic at Albany Law School: I don't think that the general public is aware of just how stuck between a rock and a hard place [domestic violence] victims really are. The gun aspect is so crucial: If you're in a home with a firearm, you're five times as likely as a woman to be killed. I have literally never seen in the hundreds of cases I've done, I've never seen a protective order where the sheriff who serves the order actually confiscates guns or forces the abuser to bring them into court or relinquish them somehow. And the woman in those instances has done everything that we've given her to do. Even with 20 years of experience, I sometimes wish our clients would just run away and hide, because I have nothing effective to help them.\n\nGraber: I was the chairperson of the work on firearms, and so we had some success in partially closing the dating loophole after VAWA passed. Under federal law, people who are subject to final domestic violence protective orders that meet certain requirements, they can't have guns if they're married to, living with or have a child with the victim. They are still allowed to have a gun, however, if they're just dating partners - we need to fully close that loophole.\n\nHenning: Crime has never gone back to the levels it was at in the '80s and early '90s. We're not back there. But what we are seeing is that in many urban areas there's an uptick in a few types of offenses - robberies, carjackings and shootings. So you're seeing a slight uptick, but people start to feel unsafe because they're high-profile incidents. And now you're seeing the draconian policies again. You're seeing the criminalization, again, of normal adolescent behavior.\n\nStroud: I don't know that it would be fair to say that as a nation our federal policy has fallen back into the mold of 1994. I don't think we're living in the same sort of era in terms of policy. I do worry about the impulse to punish more at the first whiff of heightened crime.\n\nNunes: When it comes to domestic violence, there's still a disconnect and underrepresentation of crimes being reported by persons of color and marginalized communities. So that still needs work. We still see systemic inequalities and bias or discrimination in reporting agencies, law enforcement, in the justice system.\n\nGraber: Not all domestic violence survivors are White, middle class, cisgender, heterosexual women with college educations and mortgages. Some survivors may, as a result of being victims, be involved in the legal and criminal justice systems themselves. Some survivors are not in a position where calling law enforcement would make them safe, so we need to make sure that every victim has an avenue to safety that works for them.\n\nNable-Juris: The way that communities stay safe is by doing prevention work, is by investing in the community. Incarceration is not the solution to do that. In many ways, the people who are incarcerated are key contributors to that solution. Those are the people who can come home and connect with children and young folks and explain what they have experienced and serve as a support to prevent future crimes.\n\nScott: Gradually there's more acceptance of an evidence-based approach [to crime]. One of the problems is that you just can't afford the foolishness: just locking people up without doing anything about crime. The costs of incarceration have skyrocketed. What states are spending has just gone totally out of kilter. If they put some of that money into prevention and early intervention, education generally, afterschool programs, there would be much less crime. When you just put it all into longer sentences, you have a massive expense without any concurrent reduction in crime.\n\nSulton: The majority of people understand now that long-term solutions and meaningful investments are the way to make change. And although movements are cyclical - we expect a certain degree of backlash following a moment like 2020 or a moment like 2014 - it's kind of wild that our local lawmakers still don't feel the urgency, the necessity or the political support from their constituency to make the big changes that need to happen.\n\nEddie Ellis, co-director of outreach and member services at the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth: A lot of communities are trying to do the right thing with programs and support, but not the government. There's many programs out here that are doing transformative, healing work, restorative justice work, but a lot of courts are not using those resources.\n\nIn our organization, transformative healing - which is a part of restorative justice - is about trying to bring healing to people and to help them find space to heal. You find a lot of children in these populations that have been sexually assaulted, verbally abused and in unhealthy environments that they have no control over.\n\nIn Maryland, they just passed a bill to lower the age so that 10 year olds can be arrested and charged with crimes. So you tell me: How far have we come?\n\nThe post The complicated legacy of the 1994 crime bill appeared first on The 19th .\n\nNews that represents you, in your inbox every weekday.

      "text": "Time to reverse the 1994 Crime Bill\n\nManage your account\n\nThe Waupun prison sits in the middle of a residential neighborhood (Photo | Wisconsin Examiner)\n\nFriday the 13 th of September is the gloomy anniversary of the signing of the federal 1994 Crime Bill. It is also a chance to start to remedy a horrible mistake.\n\nIt seems rare that there is consensus among leaders of both of our political parties to make a significant change. Sometimes, those are great steps forward. Sometimes it is just a big bipartisan mistake. Such was the case 30 years ago when the US Congress and President Bill Clinton passed and signed the 1994 Crime Bill.\n\nIn 1994, our leaders saw a real problem - the toll being taken by drug addiction. But they came up with the wrong solution. That mistake cost billions of dollars; it devastated entire communities; it broke up families; it ruined thousands of lives.\n\nThe 1994 Crime Bill had very little impact on crime. In the U.S., as in Wisconsin, there is almost no relationship between crime levels and prison population levels. The Crime Bill did, however, devastate many communities, especially low-income communities and communities of color.  The Crime Bill introduced extremely harsh penalties for even low-level drug crimes. Famously, it was far harder on crimes involving crack than for crimes involving powder cocaine, which resulted in more and longer incarceration for central city residents. The population of U.S. federal prisons in 1994 was less than 50,000. Today, it is more than 158,000.\n\nThe 1994 Crime Bill had a huge impact on Wisconsin and other states. The Crime Bill helped pay for new prisons.  It rewarded police departments for increasing their arrest rates as well as tougher sentencing laws, like Wisconsin's so-called 'Truth in Sentencing.\"   Aided and encouraged by the Crime Bill, Wisconsin's prison population went from less than 10,000 in 1994 to more than 22,000 today.\n\nIn Wisconsin in 2024, there is a new bipartisan consensus: We need to close at least two of Wisconsin's prisons. The Green Bay Correctional Institution (GBCI) and the Waupun Correctional Institution (WCI) were built in the 1800's. Both have received a lot of well-deserved negative publicity recently, as people have died and as the horrid conditions in those prisons have become better known. Even with dramatic pay increases, the Department of Corrections has not been able to keep enough staff to fully run programs at GBCI and WCI. The facilities are dangerous and outdated. Even spending about $50 million for each facility every year, it is impossible to make them suitable for humans to live in, or even to want to work in.\n\nWe all, Republicans, Democrats and Independents, believe GBCI and WCI need to be closed.  The question is: How? There are those who want to spend $500 million of taxpayer money to build a new prison. We believe there is a better way.\n\nWisconsin can close the Waupun and Green Bay prisons by taking common sense steps to safely reduce the prison population. Consider this: the combined populations of GBCI and WCI is about 2,000 people, less than 10% of the prison population. In Wisconsin's 38 prisons, there are about 5,000 people incarcerated for \"crimeless revocations.\"  These are people who served a sentence and have been sent back for a technical violation of their terms of supervision - not because of another crime. By reducing such revocations, as states like Texas have done, we could easily have 2,000 fewer people in prison in less than a year.\n\nThousands of people in Wisconsin prisons are, as part of their sentence, eligible to participate in \"Earned Release\" programs. But, we have not funded the Earned Release program sufficiently, so that many of them wait for years to get into the program so they can go home. We have hundreds of senior citizens languishing in Wisconsin prisons, some of them in assisted living wings of prisons.\n\nTo build a new prison would cost Wisconsin about $500 million, and would take at least 4-5 years. In the meantime, we would o force incarcerated people and staff to continue suffering in WCI and GBCI.  Common sense policies could safely reduce the population such that we could create enough space to move everybody out of the Green Bay and Waupun prisons within a year.\n\nIn 1994, we spent billions to build the incarceration infrastructure. In 2024 we can turn that around, and we can reinvest the savings in education, mental health and addiction treatment and other programs that will heal and revitalize the communities the Crime Bill helped to devastate.\n\nAfter 30 years, we have a new chance to get it right. We can get it right in Wisconsin by closing our worst prisons without building new ones.  And, in 2025 our new President needs to work with the new Congress to repeal the 1994 Crime Bill, and replace it with a 2025 Justice Reinvestment Bill.\n\nAngela Lang Robert Kraig David Liners Black Leaders Organizing Communities (BLOC) Citizen Action of Wisconsin WISDOM"

Kansas St. in Springfield.\n\nThe march began at the Illinois Police Memorial Park and ended at the Sangamon County Building, which group leaders said was intentional, reflecting their desire to build positive relationships with law enforcement agencies as they work toward change.\n\nThe Crime Bill of 1994 is the largest-ever crime bill in U.S. history, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. It provided 100,000 new police officers and allocated $9.7 billion for prisons and $6.1 billion for prevention programs, according to the department's web site.\n\nFultz and Tyshianna Bankhead, who is executive director of the group, said the Crime Bill predominately affects Black and Hispanic communities.\n\nBankhead offered that there are better ways to handle lower-level crimes and expressed her support for the Justice Reinvestment Initiative, which facilitates a collaborative process among stakeholders and system leaders to address incarcerations and recidivism.\n\nTom Ackerman is a breaking news and trending reporter with the Springfield State-Journal Register.

      "text": "For criminal justice reform to work, Biden must dismantle damage done by 1994 crime bill\n\nManage your account\n\nI am an adjunct lecturer in New York University's school of social work. I have seen what happens to young Black and brown men trapped in the injustice of our criminal system. I've also lived it, spending 19 years cycling in and out of prison before earning degrees in social work and turning my life around.\n\nSo I've been watching closely as President Joe Biden has shaped the beginning of his presidency as one that champions equity and racial and social justice reform. But he has yet to fully address how he will fix the damage caused by his 1994 crime bill - the act is, in part, responsible for the severe overincarceration of young Black and brown men who disproportionately populate the country's juvenile and adult prisons.\n\nHe was the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and created and pushed the legislation through Congress that prompted men like me to be called \"predators.\"\n\nIt's impossible to bring equity to criminal justice without fully dismantling the biases in the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 . Biden should use executive orders to eliminate the most damaging aspects that the 2018 First Step Act hasn't already addressed. One example: He could adjust the 85% rule found in the crime bill. That regulation rewards states that force offenders to serve 85% of their time before they are eligible for parole.\n\nSince Biden's famous speech on the Senate floor in 1993 advocating for the crime bill and its passage, much has changed for the worse. Scholarly articles, criminal justice movements and documentaries such as Ava Duvernay's \"13th,\" as well as famed activist and author Michelle Alexander's bestselling book \"The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness\" all highlight the adverse impact and racist undertone of this legislation .\n\nT-Pain: A year after Floyd's death, nation must do more for Black and brown victims of crime\n\nIn November 2008, the night former President Barack Obama was elected, I was sitting in a state correctional institution when the wheels of change began happening in my life. His election inspired in me a sense of hope, as it did for so many Americans. I learned that not only could America change, but I could, too.\n\nBefore then, I had spent 15 years absorbing the \"superpredator\" messaging that started in the 1990s.\n\nThose most impacted by the crime bill were people from poor Black and brown communities who, after serving their time, were released to the same impoverished neighborhoods with no access to employment or educational opportunities and no access to government assistance programs.\n\nSeverely stigmatized by society, this was only part of the collateral damage that would ensue for Black and brown inmates. For so many, the cycle of incarceration continues. Each year since that legislation, more young Black and brown folks have found themselves trapped in a caste system, with no remedy or relief.\n\nBiden was right in 1993 when he shared on the Senate floor that society had failed these communities. But he was wrong in his assessment of how America should address the issues: \" Cordon them off from the rest of society. \"\n\nColumn: Release people incarcerated under draconian marijuana laws\n\nHe was wrong to tell the American people that it didn't matter how Black and brown people got stuck at the bottom. It was wrong to demonize entire groups of people as a \"cadre of young people ... born out of wedlock,\" deprived, without parents, having no socialization skills or conscience. He made them scapegoats for political gain.\n\nThis is not an attack on the Biden administration. In spite of Biden's crime bill mistake, I voted for him and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nI watched with intent every comment and speech that he, as well as other candidates, made while on the campaign trail on the issue of justice reform in America. I also watched every debate.\n\nEven former President Donald Trump highlighted the disproportionate criminal justice impact this legislation inflicted on Black and brown communities . Trump also signed the First Step Act - the first major attempt since the Obama administration's Fair Sentencing Act to undo some of the damage caused by the 1994 crime bill.\n\nREPAIRING AMERICA: Exploring fight for reparations, racial justice across the country\n\nIt is my hope that this column will put a human face, a lived experience and a voice of reason on that disproportionate impact. It has had a rippling societal impact far beyond the lengthy prison sentences this legislation called for. There was a time when the most difficult question for me to answer when seeking employment was, \"Do you have a high school diploma?\" After 1993, the most difficult question became, \"Have you ever been incarcerated?\"\n\nSUBSCRIBE: Help support quality journalism like this.\n\nThe crime bill brought more emphasis to that last question, and in my experience and that of others, employers started pressing more for information. They were afraid to hire us. We were considered liabilities. Without access to employment opportunities, some attempted to access government benefit programs, only to learn that because of provisions in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (signed by President Bill Clinton two years after the crime bill), convicted felons who had served time for drug offenses were restricted from participating in government programs.\n\nAlthough the crime bill called for more than $380 million in drug treatment programs, the funding was limited to certain prisons, in certain states . And the programs themselves were ineffective, providing no continued services or resources to returning citizens upon release. Addiction is not a one-shot or a three-strike deal but a lifetime process; low-level offenders who were no more than recovering addicts were given life sentences.\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nI commend this administration for moving forward to end contracts with private prisons and for submitting a request to the Supreme Court to give low-level crack offenders the same opportunity for sentence reductions given for other low-level offenses under the First Step Act. I also commend Biden's admission that the 1994 crime bill was a mistake.\n\nBut the damage has been done.\n\nIn 1993, Biden stated that there was a consensus that the crime bill was the best way to solve this \"cadre of young people\" problem. Nearly three decades later, we know that the consensus was wrong.\n\nToday, the bill is seen as an utter failure - one that has created more damage to Black and brown communities than nearly any other legislation in American history. It has propped up mass incarceration and is discriminatory.\n\nPresident Biden, exercise executive power.

      "text": "Biden criminal justice plan reverses part of 1994 crime bill\n\nManage your account\n\nJoe Biden is proposing to reverse several key provisions of the 1994 crime bill he helped write in an acknowledgment that his tough-on-crime positions of the past are at odds with the views of the modern Democratic Party.\n\nThe former vice president is calling for an end to the disparity that placed stricter sentencing terms on offenses involving crack versus powder cocaine as well as an end to the federal death penalty, which the legislation authorized as a potential punishment for an increasing number of crimes.\n\nBiden is the early Democratic front-runner in no small part because of support from black voters who are crucial to winning the party's presidential nomination. But his role in crafting the 1994 crime bill could become a vulnerability. Several of his rivals have blamed the crime bill for the mass incarceration of racial minorities over the past two decades.\n\nHe was expected to talk about his criminal justice reform proposal at a speech Tuesday in New Orleans, but he didn't do so. He is scheduled to be in Detroit on Wednesday for the NAACP national convention.\n\nBiden's moves could be an attempt to blunt fellow White House contenders Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, who have escalated their critiques of the former vice president's handling of race in recent weeks. All three candidates will share a stage at next week's presidential debate.\n\nCedric Richmond, Biden's campaign chairman, called the plan \"the most forward-leaning criminal justice policy proposed.\" Richmond, a Louisiana representative and former public defender, praised it for building on Virginia Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott's SAFE Justice Act, which would reserve prison space for violent offenders and offer a wider range of non-prison sentencing alternatives. Scott's bipartisan bill is co-sponsored by other members of the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nBy building on Scott's bill, Biden, who represented Delaware in the U.S. Senate for decades, is moving significantly to the left but not quite as far as endorsing the type of sweeping overhaul championed by Booker. Booker unveiled a proposal this year that would go beyond the criminal justice measure that President Donald Trump signed into law last year by slashing mandatory minimum sentences.\n\nAnd Biden's shift on the death penalty also puts him in line with every other Democratic presidential candidate except for Montana Gov. Steve Bullock. It's a stark change of Biden's previous approach to the issue: Touting the toughness of the crime bill in 1992, the then-Senate Judiciary Committee chairman joked that it would do \"everything but hang people for jaywalking.\"\n\nBiden's plan would seek to create a $20 billion grant program to encourage states to reduce incarceration by increasing spending on child abuse prevention, education and literacy, as long as states eliminate mandatory minimum sentencing for nonviolent crimes.\n\nHe also would expand the Justice Department's role in rooting out institutional misconduct by police departments and prosecutors and would establish an independent task force to study prosecutorial discretion in an attempt to head off racial and ethnic discrimination.\n\nThe plan also includes spending $1 billion annually on changes in the juvenile justice system and identifies as a goal that all former inmates have access to housing when they leave prison.\n\nBiden also plans to seek a renewed ban on assault weapons, an element of the 1994 crime bill he continues to promote, and a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines.\n\nTrump, a Republican, tweeted in May while championing his own criminal justice measure that \"anyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected. In particular, African Americans will not be able to vote for you.\"\n\nSince the last debate, Biden has focused his campaign speeches on his stint as vice president and has aggressively proposed policies in recent weeks that build on gains in President Barack Obama's administration, including criminal justice.\n\nBooker has hinted that he would renew his criticisms of Biden's lead role on the 1994 crime bill when the two candidates share the stage during the second set of Democratic presidential debates in Detroit next week. He offered a preview of that criticism on Tuesday, pushing back at Biden's criminal justice plan in a tweet that didn't name the former vice president: \"It's not enough to tell us what you're going to do for our communities, show us what you've done for the last 40 years,\" Booker wrote.\n\nHarris, too, has chastised Biden's role in the 1994 bill. But Harris herself has been criticized by criminal justice reform advocates as being too tough on the accused during her tenures as the San Francisco district attorney and as California's attorney general before she was elected senator.\n\nHarris has answered those criticisms by saying she supports major changes to federal criminal justice. She partnered with a senior House Democrat on Tuesday to propose legislation that would decriminalize marijuana and expunge records of federal marijuana offenses, steps that Biden aligns with in his new plan - although Harris and Booker have both gone further than Biden in their support of full marijuana legalization.\n\n___\n\nSchor reported from Washington."

But here's where the mistake came. The mistake came in terms of what the states did locally.\"\n\nBiden noted that while the federal government lowered mandatory minimums and a statute he called \"same crime, same time,\" those elements applied mostly to federal offenses. States retained their own sentencing power and ability to build more prisons, which they did.\n\nBiden also noted that the bill was created after a spike in crime in the late 1980s and early '90s. Scholars have noted that for urban centers, this timing aligns with the height of the crack epidemic. Parts of the bill toughened sentences for possession of crack cocaine during an epidemic that disproportionately affected Blacks.\n\nHe now contends that no one should serve time in prison for drug possession, and the country instead should be funding rehabilitation centers.\n\nThe former vice president also noted that, at the time, the crime bill was supported by the Congressional Black Caucus and Black mayors across the nation. However, he also said, \"things have changed drastically,\" noting that violent crime has dropped dramatically, and racial justice issues in America are different now than at that period.\n\nThis is not the first time that Biden has said elements of the controversial bill were a mistake.

      "text": "Democrats Harris and Biden clash over 1994 crime bill in New Hampshire stops\n\nManage your account\n\nBy Amanda Becker (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Kamala Harris said during a presidential campaign stop in New Hampshire on Wednesday that she disagreed with former Vice President Joe Biden, who said a day earlier that his Senate vote for a 1994 crime bill did not contribute to mass incarceration. Harris, who previously served as the top prosecutor for San Francisco and then for California, said at a town hall that she has a \"great deal of respect\" for Biden but disagreed with him on this issue. \"That 1994 crime bill, it did contribute to mass incarceration in our country. It encouraged and was the first time that we had a federal three strikes law. It funded the building of more prisons in the states. And so I disagree, sadly,\" Harris told reporters. Biden was in New Hampshire earlier this week on his first swing through the early-voting state since he entered the field of more than 20 Democrats vying for the 2020 presidential nomination. During a Tuesday stop, Biden said: \"This idea that the crime bill created mass incarceration, it did not create mass incarceration.\" He conceded that the 1994 crime bill was not perfect, especially as it related to harsher sentences for crack versus powder cocaine, which disproportionately sent minorities to prison. The 1994 crime bill, which was signed into law by Democratic President Bill Clinton, resurfaces frequently in Democratic politics as sentiments shift on how to best address crime. The bill included $9 billion for the construction of federal prisons. It also included a \"three strikes\" provision, which required a mandatory life sentence for a person guilty of committing a severe, violent felony after two previous convictions. Independent assessments have show it is difficult to isolate the bill's impact. Crime rates in the United States had started to decline during the 1970s and continued to decline after the bill's passage. Prison populations started to grow in the 1970s and continued to do so after the bill's passage. According to the nonpartisan Marshall Project, which tracks criminal justice issues: \"The crime bill did not inaugurate the era of mass incarceration, but it certainly escalated the scale of its impact.\" Harris, who trails Biden in polls, has faced criticism of her own for criminal justice decisions she made as a state prosecutor, including defending California's three strikes law in the state's highest court and opposing a ballot measure to amend it, though she acknowledged it had flaws.

But he's still being haunted by his decision to sign the 1994 Crime Bill - which some critics claim put hundreds of thousands of black people behind bars.\n\nOver the weekend, Clinton made a campaign stop in Watts, a predominantly Latino and black neighborhood in South Los Angeles. Watts - home to an infamous race riot in 1965 - became synonymous with crime in the mid-to-late 20th century.\n\nClinton was taking a photo with two attendees, both black men, when an unidentified woman shouted from a short distance away:\n\n\"Hey Clinton, fuck you! Our people are still in jail from your crime bill!\"\n\nThe crime bill, which was publicly touted by then-first lady Hillary Clinton, has haunted the Clintons throughout this campaign. Hillary Clinton has since tried walking back on her initial support, even apologizing for it during a debate earlier this spring.\n\n\"I'm sorry for the consequences that were unintended and that have had a very unfortunate impact on people's lives,\" she said in April.\n\nBut the bill and its perceived impact are still open wounds for many potential voters. In February, a black activist named Ashley Williams confronted Hillary Clinton at a private campaign event in South Carolina, setting off a viral hashtag, #WhichHillary , criticizing Clinton's inconsistent positioning on the issue.\n\nIn April, Bill Clinton chided crime bill critics in Philadelphia - whom he mistakenly thought were Black Lives Matter activists - but has also admitted in the past that the bill made the problem of mass incarceration worse.\n\n\"In that bill, there were longer sentences and most of these people are in prison under state law, but the federal law set a trend,\" Clinton said in 2015. \"And that was overdone, we were wrong about that. The good news is we had the biggest drop in crime in history ... The bad news is we had a lot of people who were essentially locked up who were minor actors for way too long.\"\n\nThe tense interaction in Watts, South Carolina and elsewhere suggest that anger over the bill's impact is still palpable for many Americans."

      "text": "Editorial: The legacy of California's 'three strikes' law is 30 years of wasted spending and ruined lives\n\nManage your account\n\nThe symbol of sentencing excess in California could be an extra-large slice of pepperoni pizza, taken from four youngsters on the Redondo Beach Pier.\n\nThe petty theft resulted in a sentence of 25 years to life in prison for Jerry Dewayne Williams because he had a record that included two serious or violent felonies - and because several months earlier, California lawmakers had passed the \"three strikes\" law, meant to forever remove so-called career criminals from society.\n\nThat legislation was signed into law 30 years ago, on March 7, 1994.\n\nBy that time, the crime surge of the 1980s had already crested, and crime had begun its historic plunge . Still, voters in the state of Washington adopted a \"three strikes\" law, and two particularly horrific California murders - those of 18-year-old Kimber Reynolds and 12-year-old Polly Klaas - inspired a similar initiative proposal here . Before the measure reached voters, California lawmakers rushed their own version to the governor, who signed it into law. Voters then approved the initiative, adopting the law a second time.\n\nA host of tough-on-crime measures followed from both Republicans and Democrats, even as crime continued its free fall. Police spending skyrocketed. The 1994 federal crime bill , shepherded through the U.S. Senate by then-Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware and signed into law by President Clinton, included a \"three strikes\" provision. More than 20 other states also adopted versions of \"three strikes.\"\n\nBut none were as rigid as California's, which doubled the sentence for a second strike, and considered any felony, even if not serious or violent, a third strike. The Times has opposed \"three strikes\" from the beginning, warning that it would fill prisons and devastate the state budget.\n\nCosts included larger payrolls for prison guards, whose union lobbied both for raises and for longer sentences. The toll also rose for families and communities that suffered the most from the loss of parents to prison, not for murder or rape but for mid-level crimes that may well have required some incarceration, but not decades' worth.\n\nDefenders of the \"three strikes\" law correctly note that Williams served only five years after he asked a judge for a sentence reduction. And they point out that Proposition 36 , passed by voters in 2012, rewrote the law to require the third offense to be serious or violent, just like the first two. No more life sentences for petty theft, right?\n\nBut there are several problems with those arguments. Although a jury rejected the D.A.'s robbery charges and convicted Williams of the lesser charge of petty theft, another jury might easily send a third striker away for life for doing exactly the same thing. Many crimes charged as robberies fall well short of the stereotypical holdup at an ATM or convenience store. Life terms for stolen pizza, even purse-snatchings, are excessive, even if those crimes do require some incarceration. A substantial body of evidence shows that after a few years, the dissuasive power of prison reverses and the risk of new crimes increases.\n\nThat's equally true for second strikers, who also serve gratuitously long terms under the uniquely California provision that doubles every sentence for a second serious or violent felony. Studies show second strikers to be at greater risk of reoffending than they would be after serving shorter sentences. Of the 93,560 people in California state prisons at the end of February, nearly 23% - or 21,320 - were second strikers, few of whom committed murder or other crimes that already carry long sentences. Many could, and should, be safely released, and the $132,000 per year that California spends on each to keep them locked up could be spent instead on programs to prevent crime in the first place.\n\nLater this year, the state Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments in a lawsuit brought against Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. George Gascón by the L.A. County prosecutors' union for following through on his campaign promise to not seek double or life terms under the \"three strikes\" law. Of the 11 candidates who challenged him in the March 5 race, seven are either current of former union members and one is on the union's legal team for the lawsuit.\n\nMeanwhile, President Biden, who now repudiates parts of the 1994 crime bill , is facing an election rematch with Donald Trump, who signed a federal law reversing some sentencing excesses - but who gets lots of political mileage from false declarations about rampant crime.\n\nCrime levels continue their descent following a significant pandemic-related spike. Yet lawmakers try to display their public safety bona fides by debating rollbacks of key criminal justice reforms, and voters consider whether to stick with, or jettison, reform-oriented D.A.s like Gascón. And, three decades later, we have yet to unwind the destructive excess of gratuitously long sentences.\n\nThat task can be completed only with another ballot measure, this time to repeal or drastically modify \"three strikes.\" In the meantime the task of chipping away at its injustices and inefficiencies falls to district attorneys - and the California Supreme Court.\n\nIf it's in the news right now, the L.A.

The former secretary of State has been winning a dominant share of minority votes, and if that stops, she could be in trouble. As we noted Thursday , the Democratic race is entering a decisive phase, and Bernie Sanders needs a dramatic change in voting patterns to have any hope of winning the nomination.\n\nBut that seems unlikely, given Clinton's overwhelming majorities in this key party demographic, and the fact that Black Lives Matter does not speak for all African-Americans.\n\nThe deeper query, however, is \"Who's right?\"\n\nThe answer to that - whether the crime bill was a mistake that needlessly incarcerated thousands of blacks, or a necessary response to a surge in urban crime - may depend on one's generational and racial perspective.\n\nLet's step back and let the protest set the stage. While speaking in Philadelphia on behalf of his wife Thursday, Bill Clinton was repeatedly heckled about his crime bill and its effects. According to reports from the scene, the protesters were persistent and angry. One yelled that Mr. Clinton should be charged with crimes against humanity.\n\nThe protesters were speaking from an experience in which police violence against blacks and the disproportionate imprisonment of young black men have become enormous national issues. Rightly or wrongly, the '94 crime bill, which expanded the death penalty, encouraged states to hand out lengthier prison sentences, and reduced federal aid for inmate education, is often cited as a wellspring of today's US incarceration policies.\n\nClinton responded to the protesters by repeating the nature of the crimes the legislation was meant to address, among other things.\n\n\"I don't know how you characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out on the street to murder other African-American children,\" Clinton said. \"You are defending the people who kill the people whose lives you say matter.\"\n\nThe ex-president was speaking from a remembered experience in which crime was rising, in part due to the crack epidemic, and the fabric of urban life seemed threatened. During his time in office, he defended the legislation to African-American audiences with similar logic, saying that he was trying to save their communities from social forces that were ripping them apart.\n\nMany blacks supported him then . It's possible older generations of African-American voters would side with Clinton, while younger generations, focused on what they see as the bill's malign effects, would not.\n\nWhat Mr. Clinton didn't talk about Thursday was the political context in which the bill passed. At the time, the political tides were moving toward Republicans. The bill contained some provisions of which the GOP deeply disapproved, such as a ban on assault weapons. The sentencing provisions were in part a legislative compromise to get Congress to approve the entire thing.\n\nThat maneuver worked - the final bill passed the House and Senate in August, and was signed into law by President Clinton on Sept. 13, 1994. But the November midterm elections were a slaughter for the Democrats. Republicans won back control of the Senate. They took control of the House for the first time since 1952.\n\nSo that's the context. Protesters were insisting that Clinton (and by extension his wife, who defended the bill as a means to control \"super-predators\") doesn't adequately accept responsibility for the way things are today; Clinton was responding that the protesters don't understand the situation in which the bill was conceived and passed in 1994.\n\nSuch an argument lays bare the changes that have occurred in voters' views of politics since the Clinton administration. In 1994, such deals were not particularly unusual. Indeed, they were characteristic of how Congress functioned. Today, in a more polarized atmosphere at least partially ushered in by that 1994 election, such a compromise might be seen as partisan treachery - as the protesters' actions suggest.\n\nCritics say this shows it's time for Bill to get off the campaign stage because he's actually hurting Hillary. With his occasional maladroit meanderings he's reminding voters of the worst aspects of his own presidency.\n\nBut others suggest it is actually evidence of the Clintons' political savvy. James Hohmann of The Washington Post called it another \"Sister Souljah moment\" - likening it to when candidate Clinton in 1992 repudiated the comments of a black rapper who suggested it might be OK to kill white cops after the Los Angeles riots over the Rodney King verdict.\n\n\"Calling her out became legendary and helped Clinton pivot from the Democratic nominating contest he was wrapping up, when he needed base voters, to the general election, when he needed independents,\" Mr. Hohmann writes. \"Twenty-four years later, we are at a very similar phase in the campaign cycle.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

In the past, he's apologized for playing any role in the rise of African-American incarceration, for instance, yet on Thursday he seemed only defensive and a bit angry.\n\nBut come on, he's Bill Clinton. While he was never as great on the stump as people now misremember, he's still a huge Democratic draw. That's why the protesters chose him as their target in the first place. Disrupting other Clinton surrogates would have given them only a fraction of the coverage they're now receiving.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Recent tragedies involving police and young black men, she added, \"should galvanize us ... to find our balance again.\"\n\n\"We have to come to terms with some hard truths about race and justice in America,\" she said.\n\nThe words represent a viewpoint shift for Clinton, at least considering the stance the White House took when her husband, Bill Clinton, was president. In 1994, Mr. Clinton signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which outlined tougher sentences for drug offenders and included funding to build new prisons.\n\nNow, critics will look askance at what may seem a convenient shift for Mrs. Clinton at a time when racial grievances have exploded into protests in the US.\n\nYet Clinton's apparent evolution also seems to suggest a building bipartisan momentum in the US public toward reassessing whether the policies created to deal with high violent crime rates in the cities are appropriate in an era where those rates have sunk to historic lows.\n\n\"The fact is, the American public is complicit in the ways in which our police act in the inner city,\" says Robert Kane, author of the upcoming book \"No Justice, No Peace: Smart Crowds, 'Dumb' Policing and #FergusonRebellion.\" \"But I think that since Ferguson, it's clear that [events throughout the country] have brought issues of police [and justice system] accountability into the public discourse, and one reason is these events where police can be seen treading on the dignity of people they're supposed to be serving,\" said Mr. Kane, who is head of the Criminology and Justice Studies Program at Drexel University in Philadelphia.\n\nMany of the get-tough policies, including the 1994 crime bill, were aimed at quelling the most glaring violence in society - black-on-black crime, including killings, in the nation's toughest neighborhoods. But as the violent crime rate has been halved since 1992, aggressive police tactics such as broken windows and zero tolerance have gone from solution to problem, critics say, creating urban zones where people can hardly walk, bike, or drive without being suspected of wrongdoing.\n\nAccording to Clinton, the effects of such aggressive policing, as well as mass incarceration for nonviolent offenders, continue to devastate black neighborhoods. She referenced a recent New York Times data analysis that found that for every 100 black women, there are only 83 black men who aren't in jail or who haven't faced early death, meaning that 17 black men are, in essence, \"missing.\" In contrast, only one white man is missing for every 100 white women due to incarceration or early death.\n\n\"Keeping [low-level offenders] behind bars does little to reduce crime, but it does a lot to tear apart families and communities,\" Clinton said. \"When we talk about 1-1/2 million African-American men, we're talking about missing husbands, missing fathers, missing brothers: They're not there to bring home a paycheck, and the consequences are profound.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Clinton also called for all police departments in the US to use body cameras.\n\nRepublican candidates for president have not had as much to say about the conflagrations in Baltimore, with Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has in the past criticized policing policies that disproportionately affect black neighborhoods, noting awkwardly that he was glad the train he was on, which pulled through Baltimore, \"didn't stop\" Monday.\n\nYet in a notable momentum shift, calls for justice system reform are coming as much from conservatives as liberals. Conservative states like South Carolina, Texas, and South Dakota have all recently passed criminal justice reforms aimed at reducing prison populations and making it easier for ex-convicts to reenter society.\n\nAccording to a Texas Public Policy Foundation poll in March, 73 percent of Lone Star residents want to see low-level drug offenders sent to treatment instead of jail, and 61 percent want the state to spend more on treatment than the building of new prisons.\n\n\"I think there used to be a view that for a legislator to vote to reduce penalties, for example, that would mean they'd be accused of being soft on crime and they'd lose an election,\" says Marc Levin, director of the Center for Effective Justice in Austin, Texas. \"But after a lot of these votes in the states, legislators are getting positive feedback, and some are even campaigning on criminal justice reform.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But he worries that his ability to do such hiring in the future may be hurt by GOP efforts to amend the 1994 crime bill.\n\nThat's a theme that administration officials have been echoing in recent days, as the House considers GOP proposals to replace billions of dollars earmarked for new police with block grants that would allow states and localities more flexibility in spending the money. President Clinton vows to veto any bill that would change his plan to put 100,000 new police officers on US streets.\n\nRepublicans, for their part, say they're not trying to prevent communities from hiring new cops. They just want to remove federally imposed restrictions on the money. Rep. Bill McCollum (R) of Florida says the Republican House proposal will allow ''cities and counties to fight crime as they see fit. It is a rejection of the Washington-knows-best mind-set that gave us the 1994 crime bill.''\n\nUnder the terms of the Clinton crime bill passed last year, more than $200 million was awarded to communities in all 50 states in the first phase of the federal program known as Cops on the Beat (COPS).\n\nTwelve police departments from the largest cities in Massachusetts are listed in the original version of the crime bill to receive the sought-after COPS funds over a three year period. Another 200 towns here received $17.4 million in a third round of grants under the crime bill. Most of the money will go to smaller towns to hire one or two officers.\n\nWhat police departments want are more police officers, says Chief Gardella. He lost 26 percent of his personnel over the last few years as Worcester, a community of 170,000, tightened its budget. At the same time, the department was hit with a 130 percent increase in calls for service.\n\nThe community-policing funds would enable him to hire 26 new recruits. Two-dozen others are now attending the police academy as a result of $686,000 in state funds received last year. ''When they graduate we'll add to our bike patrol and our walking beats,'' he says. ''Also, we're close to starting a unique neighborhood service center, not a substation, where police will be there along with other city services.''\n\nThe COPS grants are designed to cover 75 percent of salaries. The other 25 percent comes from local funds. Cities are responsible for health benefits, up to $8,000 a year for each policeman.\n\nUnder the crime bill's stipulations, police departments receive federal money only after recruits have been trained at academies. Because of layoffs, the Brockton, Mass., police force was reduced to 102 patrolmen two years ago. Now, because of state funds and the anticipated federal funds, the number could reach 169.\n\nUnder two separate funding categories, the Boston Police Department is scheduled to receive more than $3.5 million to hire 61 new officers. ''Our concern is that flexibility be retained in the funding,'' says Jim Jordan, a department official, ''and cities be allowed to apply directly for funds. But the House and Senate versions are different, and who knows what will happen.''\n\nUnder one House GOP proposal, communities or counties would set up boards composed of representatives from the police, courts, and groups to determine local anticrime needs. In turn, the boards would apply to the federal government for the block grants. The boards decisions could conceivably lead to greater funds for police departments, rather than less.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

How they've changed since points to broader shifts within the black community.\n\nLoading...\n\nMarch 14, 2016, 6:22 p.m. ET | Boston\n\nWhen Jorge Martinez first arrived in Boston to start community organizing, he dropped into some of the city's poorest - and predominantly nonwhite - neighborhoods, which had been plagued by poverty, drug use, and violent crime for years. It was the early 1990s, and he says he was ready \"to change the world.\"\n\n\"I said I was going to deal with open-air drug dealing, open-air alcohol drinking, gang activity,\" he recalls.\n\nOne of his first acts as an organizer for Project RIGHT, a community group that promotes public safety and economic development, was to organize a community meeting in Roxbury around gang activity. In a neighborhood of 59,000 people , five women came. Within minutes, one of them was crying as her mother berated her about now not being able to go home.\n\nMr. Martinez asked why. Then he looked out the window and found the answer.\n\n\"I saw gang members on the corners, looking at who was coming into the meeting,\" he remembers. Simply attending a meeting to discuss gangs and drug dealing, it appeared, \"could get you killed.\"\n\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s, this was the everyday reality in African-American neighborhoods around the country. It was in this context that black political leaders, under pressure from their communities, pleaded for the federal government to address the drug problem. The now infamous response from the federal government was a series of bipartisan \"tough on crime\" laws that, instead of just cracking down on drugs and violent crime as intended, filled the country's prisons to a breaking point, disproportionately with young black men.\n\nNow amid bipartisan efforts to undo many of these laws, and the rise of a new generation of civil rights activists, this history has created a strange dissonance. Black Lives Matter activists have criticized Hillary Clinton , the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, for supporting these tough-on-crime policies as first lady in the '90s. But Mrs. Clinton has ridden overwhelming support from black voters to a commanding lead in the Democratic primaries. Earlier this month, the urban black vote helped her edge out a victory in the Massachusetts primary over challenger Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\n\"If you read some intellectuals on the left, they'd suggest there should be a grudge against the Clintons, but I think the primary results show there isn't a grudge at all,\" says Michael Fortner, a professor of urban studies at the City University of New York and author of the book \"Black Silent Majority.\"\n\nPart of the reason, he notes, is that black communities are aware that for decades they were some of the loudest advocates for tough drug laws. Tough-on-crime policies, he adds, \"weren't something that just happened to black people, that were imposed on the black community.... Political leaders, mayors, and pastors played an important role in pushing for these policies.\"\n\nAnother reason, he says, is that most black voters aren't just concerned about criminal justice policy, past or present.\n\n\"They're also, like everybody else, concerned about paying their bills, they're concerned about good schools, concerned about achieving the American dream,\" he says.\n\nBut as these black communities contend with the spectrum of issues brought on by the drug laws of the early '90s, they are also working to roll back those laws. At the federal level, there is enough bipartisan support for such criminal justice reforms - including reducing mandatory minimums for some low-level drug offenses - that it could be one of the few things Congress passes this election year.\n\nOverhauling America's criminal justice system has also become an election issue. Ending policing that comes down hard on minor infractions and decriminalizing marijuana possession are two of the stated policy goals of the Black Lives Matter movement. In Massachusetts, Project RIGHT is also working on similar reforms at the state level, Martinez says.\n\n\"I think the African-American community, like Hillary Clinton, they've had to rethink their approach,\" says Thomas Whalen, an associate professor of social sciences at Boston University. \"And you have to. In a so-called drug war, you can't be rigid in your position and hope to be ultimately successful - you have to be as flexible as possible based on the conditions on the ground.\"\n\nEvidence that a change of mentality is taking hold can be found in the government response to the heroin crisis, which has many parallels to the crack epidemic that gripped black communities in the 1980s.\n\n\"Now there's a recognition that those policies [in the '90s] failed,\" says Professor Whalen. \"Now there's a recognition in law enforcement increasingly that there should be an emphasis on drug treatment, rather than locking them up and throwing away the key.\"\n\nFor many decades, however, drugs were a priority. As early as June 1970, for example, Ebony magazine published an article titled: \"Blacks declare war on dope.\" In 1986, 16 of 19 African-American members of the House co-sponsored President Reagan's Anti-Drug Abuse Act. And eight years later, 22 members of the Congressional Black Caucus voted for Bill Clinton's 1994 crime bill that boosted funding to police, expanded the death penalty, and created the \"three strikes\" sentencing law.\n\nRoxbury was a neighborhood where these policies took a particularly heavy toll. A historically Irish and Italian enclave, redlining - denying services based on the racial makeup of a neighborhood - made it one of the few places where African-Americans in Boston could get a bank loan to buy a house. As black families moved in, white families moved out, sometimes burning properties down for insurance money as they left. By the 1980s, there were around 1,300 vacant lots in the neighborhood, along with illegal trash dumping and a drug epidemic.\n\nAsk long-time residents about that period and they respond with a mixture of anger and resignation. One recent Friday morning, the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center in Roxbury, Purvis Coleman, 72, took a break from lifting weights to reflect on that period.\n\n\"I really think they were just overwhelmed, because [drug-dealing] was happening everywhere,\" he says.\n\n\"The first thing they thought of was, 'We'll take people off the streets and that'll stop people from doing it,' \" he adds. \"I think they could've put more thought into it. But that was one way of dealing with it, and that's what they did.\"\n\nNearby, an 89-year-old called Billy scoffs, blinking through circular tortoiseshell glasses. After growing up nearby in Boston's South End in the 1920s, riding streetcars along cobblestoned streets, he watched as drugs and gang violence consumed the city's black neighborhoods. Not hiding his bitterness, he echoes an argument that many in the black community have made recently : a heroin epidemic is ravaging white Americans in suburbs and small towns, and authorities are taking a much softer approach to it than they did with drug epidemics that struck black communities decades ago.\n\n\"Police didn't give a damn. We survived,\" he says. \"Now that it's the white community, they're trying to do something,\" he says.\n\nThe new emphasis on treatment, rather than punishment, certainly had not been tried in Roxbury, Mr. Coleman agrees.\n\nAfter arresting someone for having some weed, \"they would act like he had something really, really serious. Now they're saying, 'He's not a criminal, he's sick.' Why wasn't he sick in the '60s?\" he asks. \"The stuff they're saying now is, 'It's a sickness.' It was a sickness then, too.\"\n\nMartinez, now Project RIGHT's executive director, is busy dealing with a new generation of issues created by drug-war policies: integrating ex-convicts back into society, helping children from broken families get economic and educational opportunities, encouraging economic development without inciting gentrification.\n\nThe tough on crime policies, he says, \"have driven this neighborhood into a worse place.\"\n\n\"Uncles, fathers, brothers, have been in prison for crimes that really shouldn't have got them the number of years they got,\" he adds. \"This has become intergenerational now. This has affected families across decades.\"\n\nColeman sits on a bench in the athletic center, leaning on his knees, stroking his thin white beard. He understands why some African-Americans are still angry about the damage the policies of the 1990s did to their communities - part of him is angry as well - but as the response to the current heroin crisis has shown, it seems that some lessons have been learned. He doesn't want anger to obstruct that.\n\n\"If someone hurt you and you get angry about it, and you stay angry, you only hurt yourself,\" he says.\n\n\"If you find that person and found out why they did it, find a solution to the problem, it gives you a chance to understand why they might've did what they did,\" he adds. \"Hopefully, I think people are looking at things a little different now.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

It will seek consensus recommendations for public safety and justice reform.\n\nLoading...\n\nJuly 23, 2019, 12:19 p.m. ET | Sacramento, Calif.\n\nA new criminal justice reform group launching Tuesday brings together Democratic and Republican governors, a Black Lives Matter organizer, and a Koch Industries vice president in an unlikely collaboration aimed at harnessing momentum following a bipartisan overhaul last year.\n\nCulled by veteran criminal justice policy expert Adam Gelb, the Council on Criminal Justice includes former California Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown and Kentucky Republican Gov. Matt Bevin. It also has Charles Ramsey, a former police leader in Washington and Philadelphia, and Black Lives Matter lead organizer DeRay Mckesson.\n\nTying it all together are the group's two co-chairs: Koch Industries Vice President Mark Holden, general counsel for the Kansas-based energy conglomerate of billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch, who advocate for conservative causes, and Sally Yates, the former Deputy U.S. Attorney General who was fired by President Donald Trump after she refused to defend his executive order banning immigration from some majority Muslim countries.\n\n\"It's one of the few issues in which you do find some bipartisan consensus these days,\" Ms. Yates said about criminal justice reform in an interview. \"We need to latch on to that and to latch on to this moment in time to be able to drive that forward.\"\n\nThe council wants to raise $25 million over five years to fulfill its mission. The group already has a $2 million first-year budget from donors, including HBO, the Ford Foundation, Arnold Ventures, the H.F. Guggenheim Foundation, the Joyce Foundation, the New York Community Trust, and the Malcolm Hewitt Wiener Foundation.\n\nOthers spanning the political spectrum on the council's 25-member board of trustees include CNN host and political commentator Van Jones, who heads the REFORM Alliance; California Supreme Court Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye, who gave up her Republican Party affiliation last year; and Philadelphia's former Democratic mayor, Michael Nutter.\n\nTrustees and a 16-member board of directors will pick research topics and assign task forces to generate reports. But the trustees and directors won't sign off on those reports. The first task force, led by Republican former Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, aims to find consensus steps that a politically divided federal government can quickly take to improve public safety and the justice system.\n\nThe trustees and directors serve three-year terms but are lifetime council members, as is Mr. Deal. The directors are choosing about 100 more lifetime members this summer.\n\nThe group is an outgrowth of the federal First Steps Act, a major criminal justice overhaul that Trump signed into law after it passed Congress with bipartisan support. It seeks to harness energies from both sides of the aisle, bringing together people motivated by finances and fairness.\n\nThe trustees include Eddie Bocanegra, who spent 14 years in prison for a gang-related murder only to go on and earn a degree from the prestigious University of Chicago. He is now senior director of READI Chicago, which seeks to help men impacted by gun violence.\n\n\"Often people like myself with my background are excluded from these types of councils or meetings,\" Mr. Bocanegra said.\n\nMr. Holden, the vice president of Koch Industries, worked as a guard at a Massachusetts jail when he was in college, where he said he witnessed people with mental illness being \"warehoused.\"\n\n\"From my perspective, there are a lot of failed government programs. This is the ultimate failed big government program that literally destroys lives and wastes money,\" he said.\n\nThe council has two initial research projects underway, with reports expected later this year.\n\nOne is exploring incarceration trends by race and gender. The other is examining fallout from the 1994 Crime Bill passed under former Democratic President Bill Clinton. The second topic is politically fraught because the measure was crafted in large part by then-Sen. Joe Biden, who led the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time and now is seeking the Democratic nomination for president along with Sen. Bernie Sanders, who voted for it.\n\nAfter decades of dividing state and federal policymakers, the criminal justice field seems ripe for consensus, said Mr. Gelb, the council's chief executive. He previously led the Pew Charitable Trusts' Public Safety Performance Project, which researched and helped states with sentencing reforms, and once worked with Biden's committee on the 1994 Crime Bill.\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Many Americans are disconnected from how the criminal justice system actually works. Our podcast sheds light on some of these major misperceptions.\n\nFollow this podcast:\n\nAug. 03, 2020, 6:09 a.m. ET\n\nAccording to a 2020 report by the Prison Policy Initiative, 74% of people in American jails have not been convicted of a crime. Sometimes this is because they're considered a flight risk or danger to society, but the majority of individuals in jail are there because they can't afford bail. And while inside, they're often given a choice: plead guilty and get released, or stay in jail until a trial is scheduled, and hope they're proven innocent.\n\nMost people take the plea bargain.\n\nThe idea that individuals are innocent until proven guilty is supposed to be at the heart of our criminal justice system. But in reality, it's not, says Alexandra Natapoff, a professor of law at Harvard University. \"We are letting the pressures of the criminal system decide who will sustain a conviction,\" she says. \"So we are already committed, in some terrible sense, to punishing the innocent.\"\n\nIn Episode 1 of \"Perception Gaps: Locked Up,\" our reporters explore the history of mass incarceration and the long-reaching effects it has on communities.\n\nEditors note: This story has been updated to reflect Alexandra Natapoff's current location. At the time of the interview she was a law professor at the University of California, Irvine. She now teaches at Harvard University.\n\n[Interview montage]\n\nNews Channel 11 WJHL: Both officers and inmates are at their boiling point in a jail that's simply busting at the seams.\n\nPBS: ... in a country that incarcerates more people than anywhere else on earth...\n\nCBS News: Experts warn that those who work and live inside U.S. jails and prisons are especially vulnerable to the coronavirus outbreak...\n\nSenator Tom Cotton via NBC News: As for the claim we should have more empathy for criminals, I won't even try to conceal my contempt for this idea.\n\nCBS Sunday Morning: It is physically impossible to do social distancing in a three-foot-wide tier...\n\nWISH TV: ...the jam-packed jail is causing safety concerns for the staff and the inmates...\n\nSamantha Laine Perfas : If the American jail and prison population were a city, it'd be the 5th largest city in the country , with almost 2.3 million Americans locked up right now. But did you know that most people in jail have not yet been proven guilty. So what's going on?\n\nThis is Perception Gaps.\n\n[Theme music]\n\nI'm Samantha Laine Perfas and this is \"Perception Gaps: Locked Up\" by the Christian Science Monitor.\n\nWelcome to Season 2 of \"Perception Gaps,\" \"Locked Up.\" In Season 1, we looked at 10 different topics in which public perception doesn't line up with reality. Some of the topics we explored were crime, substance use, political polarization, and poverty. If you haven't listened, go back and do so! You can find all the episodes at csmonitor.com/perceptiongaps.\n\nFor Season 2, we're gonna try something a little different - we'll spend the entire season exploring one issue: mass incarceration in America.\n\nWe'll be diving deep into the criminal justice system, and the misperceptions about history, politics, race, and the economy that contribute to our attitudes toward crime and the people within the system. We'll explore how the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated many of the issues we found in our early reporting. And in our final episode, we'll look at potential solutions and where we're seeing progress.\n\nIn this episode, we'll explore a lot of the high level misperceptions around mass incarceration as a whole and how the U.S. got to a place of locking up more people than any other country.\n\nSo back to our perception gap. . . many people don't know that the vast majority of people locked up in American jails have not actually been convicted of a crime. Our first guest will help us understand how this came to be.\n\nAlexandra Natapoff: I begin the book with a story about Gail Atwater, who is a mother of two who lived in Texas, and she was the defendant in a very famous Supreme Court case named after her. Atwater vs. Lago Vista.\n\nSam : This is Alexandra Natapoff, professor of law at the University of California Irvine School of Law. She's talking about her recent book, entitled \" Punishment without Crime ,\" which looks at the United States' misdemeanor system. The book begins with a 2001 Supreme Court case that set the stage for today.\n\nAlexandra: In that case, Gail Atwater was driving her children very slowly around the local park in their neighborhood because her son Mac had lost a toy in the park, and she let the children out of their seat belts to look out of the window of the car, hopefully to see where the toy had fallen. She was pulled over by a police officer who arrested her for driving without a seatbelt. She was arrested, put into handcuffs in front of her children. Her children were hysterical and crying, watching their mother be arrested. She was taken to jail. She was booked, fingerprinted, held in a cell.\n\nSam : The thing is, Atwater never should have been held in jail at all. At the time the seatbelt offense did not carry the possibility of jail - it was 1997 , and the maximum punishment in Texas for not wearing your seatbelt was a $50 fine. Atwater sued the city of Lago Vista, and the case went all the way to the Supreme Court. Her argument was:\n\nAlexandra: This is unfair. This is unreasonable. You shouldn't be able to arrest people and put them in jail for crimes for which they could not be incarcerated even if they were found guilty. And the Supreme Court ruled against Gail Atwater. It's an extraordinarily important case because as you can see, it opens the door to all kinds of incarceration.\n\nSam : According to a 2020 report by the Prison Policy Initiative, 74 percent of people held by jails have not been convicted of a crime. And the reason is because, if they can't afford bail (and we'll get to that soon) people are detained pretrial while they wait for their cases to be resolved. Sometimes it's because they're a flight risk, or the person is believed to be a danger to society. But...\n\nAlexandra: The vast majority of our criminal system is devoted to misdemeanors like loitering, trespassing, DUI. Some dockets include assault or domestic violence, low level theft. And our jails are filled with people who are incarcerated because they are facing low level charges. They are detained pretrial and cannot afford bail. Sam: Does this have an impact on people who take plea bargains? How does that fit? Alexandra: So one of the great injustices of the bail system and the low level misdemeanor system is that it exerts pressure on individuals to plead guilty because it is so costly for them to remain incarcerated. They may lose their jobs. They may have children. They may be evicted. They may face all kinds of terrible consequences. So, in effect, putting this kind of pressure on individuals to plead guilty is like an end run around the criminal system itself. Sam: We're a nation founded on this idea of innocent until proven guilty. Does that no longer exist in our criminal justice system? Alexandra: The presumption of innocence, the idea that we should only punish people who have been proven guilty, is a fundamental notion of fairness that I think many people believe drives our criminal system. And in many ways, that's just not how our criminal system works. The role of innocence and the idea that people should not be punished until they have been proven guilty all too often falls by the wayside. We are not requiring proof of anything. We are letting the pressures of the criminal system decide who will sustain a conviction. So we are already committed in some terrible sense to punishing the innocent.\n\nSam : Even during the best of circumstances, this is a difficult  choice: To either accept a plea bargain - and admit you're guilty of something you might not be - or sit in jail for months while awaiting trial. In that time, you could lose your home, not be able to provide for your family, and potentially receive a conviction anyway.\n\nBut during a public health crisis, the danger of locking people up pretrial becomes a matter of life and death. States are recognizing that jailing someone simply because they couldn't pay bail results in overcrowded, unhygienic environments - which are especially concerning during a pandemic. At the beginning of the outbreak in the US, states rushed to address these issues: some states released inmates early, others set bail at $0, and others tried to reduce booking into jails. But it raises the question: if it's now not okay to lock up folks like this before their trials, those accused of minor, non-violent offenses, why was it OK six months ago, before a pandemic broke out? This crisis has revealed a huge blind spot for many of us.\n\nAlexandra: So part of the challenge of our criminal system is that it's opaque. The public doesn't actually know a lot about how it actually works. And we have ideas about who's in prison or who's in jail that are derived as much from popular culture and television and assumptions as they are derived from reality.\n\nSam : For example, prisons and jails are often referred to interchangeably, and they are wildly different. Prisons are used for felony sentences, and are what we often picture when we think of mass incarceration. Jails on the other hand, are used for all sorts of things: we use jails to house people who are serving shorter sentences, but also for those who have been arrested or are waiting for the case to be resolved. So how many Americans are having that experience?\n\nAlexandra: 11 million people pass through American jails every year. That means over ten million people are experiencing incarceration every year. Sam: I think it really turns things on its head when you think about what is the purpose of prison in jails, because I think many people think it is to keep the public safe. But are the people we're locking up really keeping the public safe? And how does that misperception of the connection between who we lock up and for how long and why actually relate to public safety? Alexandra: The majority of individuals in our prisons and jails suffer from substance abuse challenges. Very high percentages have mental health disabilities. So when we talk about who is in our prisons and jails, in many ways it's a reflection not of terrible, dangerous people who are engaging in terrible, dangerous conduct, but people who have been failed by the social safety net, who have been failed by our health care system, who have been failed by our economic system. And we are using our prisons and jails to respond to those failures. I think one of the great mistakes that American democracy has made is to overrely on the criminal system to do all kinds of work that civic society could do in a far more positive and less destructive way. Sam: What's the ripple effect of locking people up who are not a danger to society? Alexandra: When we lock someone up, we are not just burdening and punishing them. We are burdening and punishing their family, their children. We are burdening communities. We are stripping communities of their wage earners, of their potential wage earners, of their workers, of the people who could otherwise contribute. And because people do eventually, for the most part, come home, we are then burdening those same families, those same communities, when we send people home from prison and jail, having gone through that traumatic experience without the tools and support for reentry. We need to retire the idea that getting a misdemeanor conviction is petty, is no big deal. It can haunt people for a lifetime.\n\n[Music transition]\n\nSam : Nearly 11 million people pass through American jails every year, and not always because they did something worthy of being imprisoned. Each week, around 200,000 people move in and out of local jails.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has cast a spotlight on this reality, revealing that our prisons and jails aren't dark corners where we can keep the worst of the worst out of the public's eye. Instead, these institutions are core features of our communities, our economies, and our society. This April in Ohio, 73% of inmates at Marion Correctional Institution tested positive for the coronavirus, as well as over 100 staff members. At the time, Ohio's prison system accounted for over 20% of the state's cases.\n\nThis left me wondering, how did we develop a system so massive that its impact reaches so far into our communities? Was it always like this?\n\nBruce Western: The United States 200 years ago was a pioneer in the area of social policy.\n\nSam: This is Bruce Western, a sociologist and the co-director of the Justice Lab at Columbia University . And what he just said is pretty interesting - despite where we are now, the beginning of the penitentiary system in the US was paved with good intentions. He's talking about two approaches that were emerging in the 19th century: the Auburn system and the Pennsylvania system.\n\nBruce: One insisted really on a type of solitary confinement for people who had been convicted of crimes and the other looked more like a workhouse. And the underlying idea between both of these penitentiary systems, that people who had come into conflict with the law, who had been convicted of crimes, shouldn't be subject to corporal punishment. Instead, they would be institutionalized. They'd be incarcerated. So initially, these were progressive social reforms. And the United States was really a pioneer.\n\nSam: In a nutshell: rather than physically punishing inmates for their crimes, the idea was that work and silence would give space for inmates to think about what they'd done, and repent - hence the term penitentiary. We now know that rehabilitation is so much more complex. But back then, it was progressive thinking, and the system was small.\n\nBruce: The idea that mass incarceration in America is historically new is really important. People who know about American criminal justice often think of the current situation as being with us forever. The very, very high incarceration rates really only emerged over the last couple of decades.\n\nSam: Starting in the 1970s, changes began to happen when the War on Drugs started.\n\n[Historical audio insert, President Richard Nixon: America's public enemy number one in the United States is drug abuse.\n\n[Historical audio insert, President Ronald Reagan: Millions of dollars will be allocated for prison and jail facilities so that the mistake of releasing dangerous...]\n\nSam: And the prison and jail populations began to grow every year. Today, incarceration rates are five times higher than their historic average.\n\nBruce: So criminal justice policy really went through a very, very radical transformation through the 80s and 90s. Through the 1960 of course, you had tremendous progress in the expansion of particularly African American citizenship through the civil rights movement. And liberal and progressive political forces all around the country were mobilizing on behalf of civil rights.\n\n[Historical audio insert, civil rights marching and protest sounds]\n\nAnd then by the time you get to the 1970s, a political backlash has started. There was an appetite for punishment among voters, or at least certain segments of voters. And this tough on crime language, which is often highly racialized, associating the problem of crime, particularly with African American men. This becomes part of the political conversation and it's the political impetus that's pushing penal policy in this very punitive direction.\n\nSam: That political strategy continued into the 90s, with the 1994 Crime Bill passed by Democratic President Bill Clinton.\n\n[Historical audio, President Bill Clinton: There must be no doubt about whose side we're on. People who commit crimes should be caught, convicted, and punished. This bill puts government on the side of those who abide by the law...]\n\nSam: It capped a 20 year period of bipartisan consensus that being \"tough on crime\" was the best course of action for the U.S. The bill was focused on the federal system, which only accounted for about 10 percent of the prison system. However, one provision gave states money for prison construction if they adopted certain policies that required convicts to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences. That incentivized states to change their sentencing measures, and resulted in massive growth in state prison construction.\n\nWhile this bill had enormous effects, the ideology behind it had been decades in the making.\n\nBruce: People often point to the crime bill as the origins of mass incarceration. I think its influence was smaller than that, but it was symbolically very important because it demonstrated that a consensus had emerged around very punitive crime policy in which a main response to the social problems of violence was incarceration. Sam: Were there misperceptions at the time around the types of crimes that were being committed and the types of people that might be impacted by this legislation? Bruce: I think it was well understood that this was going to have a huge effect on low income communities of color. I'm not sure there was a well-founded belief that this would solve the problem of crime in those communities. But there was certainly a belief that this was doing something. If you look at Black men born in the late 1970s, among those Black men, if they dropped out of high school, if they never finished high school, we estimate that 70 percent of them have been to prison. It's happened at a time when crime rates are at their historically lowest level in 40 years. To me, it's a really dramatic and tragic inequality.\n\nSam: Why that is... mostly boils down to extremely long sentences and trying to answer every crime problem with imprisonment, Bruce added. This approach leads to abnormally high levels of incarceration when you compare us to other parts of the world.\n\nBruce: There are about 60,000 people in the United States who are currently on so-called life without parole sentences. And so these are people that will never be released. In Western Europe, the number of people serving life without parole sentences, natural life sentences, they call them over there is about 50 people.\n\nSam: In a 2017 report, The Sentencing Project, a research and advocacy nonprofit, actually put the number at about 53,000. To be fair, there are more people in the US than in western Europe - however, if the ratio were the same as ours, they would have something like 32,000 people serving life without parole sentences, not 50.\n\nSam: I also think that when people hear, this person is serving life without parole, they probably a lot of people think, well, then they must have done something that's worthy of that sentence. But when you compare us to Western Europe, then obviously that is a very, very striking difference. And it seems hard to believe that that many more people would have acted in a way worthy of that sentence and so few people in another part of the world. Bruce: Yeah, I think you put your finger on it, right. You visit Western Europe, it's not terribly different from the United States. America's not sort of an utterly chaotic and violent place. So, what is different? I think there's a connection between the emergence of mass incarceration and America's centuries long history of racial injustice. The entire history of the African American community has been this political struggle over freedom and citizenship. And I think to be able to lock someone up for the rest of their lives, you have to dehumanize them. This long history of dehumanization, that's the political context in which we adopt sentencing policies that send people away for the rest of their lives.\n\nSam: The experience of Black Americans encountering the criminal justice system is an important one, and we'll be taking a closer look at this topic later in the season. But it's worth noting that people of color are disproportionately put behind bars. Racism is baked into the criminal justice system, and those who are locked up are not the only ones affected.\n\nJuleyka Lantigua-Williams: Today, 70 million Americans have a criminal record.\n\nSam: This is Juleyka Lantigua-Williams, founder and CEO of Lantigua Williams & Co. , a full service production company. One of their podcasts is titled 70 Million , and it centers on the stories of those who have encountered the criminal justice system. I asked Juleyka, what is the effect of having 70 million Americans with criminal records?\n\nJuleyka: Oh, it creates an incredible talent deficit for the country. And that talent deficit translates into real economic impact. So, for example, combined across all 50 states, there are something like 27,000 professional licenses for which someone with a criminal record can simply not apply for. It is an immediate deficit for the economy.\n\nSam: That's not the end of it. If you have a criminal record, you're also unable to own a home or rent without a guarantor. In some cases, it goes even further.\n\nJuleyka: In some extreme cases, they're not even being allowed... Like, the New York City Housing Authority does not allow someone who is returning from after serving time, to live in public housing with their own family. That's the law.\n\nSam: Juleyka says their reporting digs into an issue that we talked about earlier: the idea that incarceration doesn't affect just the individual, but the entire community.\n\nJuleyka: One of the episodes from Season 2 this year looked at the impact specifically on Black women of having a significant other or a parent or a sibling be sent to prison for a meaningful amount of time. And Black women categorically bear the greatest burden, because they have to become the sole providers for their immediate family and often a provider for the extended family. I grew up in the South Bronx in the 80s and 90s, and I am very much aware of what happens when overnight a big brother disappears. An uncle disappears, that gets sent away.\n\nSam: You had mentioned that storytelling and the narrative component of people's stories is a really big part of 70 Million. How does that approach help address some of the biggest misperceptions around those who are convicted? Juleyka: You know, I can spew numbers at you all day long, but if I tell you the story of a woman in Texas who lost her child because they would not give her medical attention when she went into labor... [Audio excerpt from 70 Million, Shandra Williams: And Dr. Hayes took me, took my hand, and he shook it and he grabbed it real tight and he just hugged me. The sheriff's department was already trying to put me in handcuffs. And the lady said, he's gone. On October 30th. They called it stillborn.] Juleyka: ...that's going to stay with you. Right. And if I tell you the story of another woman who was in jail with her, who was in prison with her, who interviewed her and wrote down notes... [Audio excerpt from 70 Million, Diane Wilson: I remember it was Christmas and, and I remember she came in real late at night. ... The next day, her family came and picked her up, I remember that. But I did get her story.] Juleyka: ...and then 15 years later, we reunited them to show that the second woman had started a nonprofit organization to make sure that mothers in Texas were not chained to a bed during labor, and that they would receive proper medical attention... [Audio excerpt from 70 Million, Diana Claitor: It was very easy to go into offices and say we have two bills. One is for medical care for pregnant women in jails. The other is to stop shackling them while they're in labor and childbirth. And people would just freeze and say tell me you didn't just say that.] Juleyka: ...that's a story that's going to stay with you.\n\nSam: From this story an organization called the Texas Jail Project came to life, and it advocates for more humane practices in the Texas county jail system. And other stories have promoted change as well. The podcast is open sourced, which means it is free for others to use, distribute, and modify - the clips you just heard came from Season 2, Episode 7. The podcast's website also provides tool kits that show how programs like the Texas Jail Project were created, so anyone can use it as a blueprint in their own community.\n\nJuleyka : I have seen how one person has created, you know, a chain reaction. And that's really all it takes sometimes, just one person to say, \"Enough. Something has to be done and I'm going to be the one to do it.\"\n\n[Music transition]\n\nSam: We've talked a lot about how incarceration affects families and communities - and how many Americans experience incarceration before they've been convicted of a crime.  So now, we're going to hear from a couple who knows firsthand what it's like to go through this.\n\nBrittany Williams: We were living in Glendale Heights - so that with roughly, maybe a 30 minute drive from the city of Chicago. And we just had, it was just amazing being out there. It was amazing. You know, I love the values that I grew up with, and I knew that I could have the same with my boys.\n\nSam: This is Brittany Williams, an insurance broker and the mother of three boys. Her husband, Tim, teaches entrepreneurship and how to grow a business. He grew up on the West Side of Chicago, so the life they were building for themselves was very different than what he grew up with: In Glendale Heights there was less crime, better schools... they had a daycare a block away, and they lived in a neighborhood that was more of a community. So what happened in October 2017 had an enormous effect on their lives. Here's Tim.\n\nTim Williams: It was actually a good day. I had just left from... me and my wife was having lunch. It was our anniversary. So I had just had lunch with my wife. I was going to the store and we were going to meet back up. But I was pulled over by police.\n\nSam: Tim was pulled over by the police for an act while driving. We understand that this is a vague description. But in an effort to respect the couple's privacy and their efforts to rebuild their lives, we will not be discussing the details of their case. They did ask us to note that the charge was sealable, which means it can be kept out of public record.\n\nAfter Tim was pulled over, he was immediately arrested, taken to the station, booked, and put in front of a judge. She set his bond at $100,000. Her decision gave Tim the option to await trial outside of jail - if he paid 10 percent of the total sum, or about $10,000.\n\nTim: I'm not quite sure how did she decide what my bond was.I wasn't sure why I had a bond like that, but I knew I couldn't pay that bond.\n\nSam: So he stayed behind bars. Back home, Brittany was searching frantically for a way to get Tim out.\n\nBrittany: I googled every day ... sorry [starts crying]... for 10 days straight to find something. And I came across their number on Google, and I called and I remember leaving a voicemail. And I can't remember his name, but he called me back in two or three days.\n\nSam: Brittany had found a group called the Chicago Community Bond Fund , a nonprofit that provides funds for people who have been locked up pre-trial and can't afford to pay their bond. The Fund paid Tim's bail, and he was released on electronic monitoring for 10 months. But by then, he had spent 2 months in jail. He still hadn't been convicted of anything.\n\nBefore his arrest, Tim had been the breadwinner for the family. Brittany had just had a baby and was staying at home to raise their children. So while Tim was in jail, Brittany and the kids were evicted from their home.\n\nBrittany : It was very difficult. I did a lot of praying and just keeping my mind focused on, he'll be home. And just knowing that I have to be strong, not just for myself, but also for the children, because now they're, you know, questioning, where's Dad? And, you know, what's been going on? I felt like a failure more than anything, like I have failed my children. Here we are, going from everyone having their own space, we're comfortable to now, living with my sister-in-law in the city of Chicago, my first time ever living in the city. So it was quite an adjustment.\n\nSam: After he was released on electronic monitoring, Tim still could not work - he couldn't even go outside to take the garbage out. He was essentially a prisoner in his own home. So Brittany had to both provide for their family and take care of the children - pretty much on her own.\n\nThen, after months of being on house arrest, Tim finally had his day in court. He was convicted, served 15 days in jail, and then spent a year on parole. Think about that: Tim served a year of punishment pretrial for a crime that merited only two weeks behind bars.\n\nIt's been about a year since Tim's case was finally closed. The family has been working overtime to put their lives back together.\n\nBrittany: It took time for us to build the life we have now and we're still thriving. We're definitely not where we want to be as a family and as entrepreneurs. I don't think that the justice systems understand how communities and families are torn apart. I don't know what I would have done if I wasn't thinking straight, because now I'm just thinking about how I'm going to provide. And just imagine so many other women or people out there who have gone through this and may not be able to emotionally bring themselves strong enough to just be decent and just get through it.\n\nSam: So, this episode might be a lot to process. As we reported this series, I often felt overwhelmed, especially with the coronavirus pandemic and the civil unrest sweeping the country. In many ways, these things have forced the conversation to happen with a greater sense of urgency. But almost every person we talked to for this season was hopeful that we are moving towards positive change. The thing is, we need to recognize the problems before we can start thinking about solutions. We'll be hearing from many of the people who are contributing to progress - and sharing what we learn with you.\n\n[Theme music]\n\nThanks for listening, and we hope you'll join us for future episodes.

But campaigning for a loved one can be harder than advocating for oneself, and the party has changed.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated July 27, 2016, 4:18 p.m. ET | Philadelphia\n\nBill Clinton - a.k.a. the Big Dog - was in the house Tuesday night, and the former president did not disappoint.\n\nHe was charming and steely-eyed, and owned the arena as he told his wife's story in personal terms, from their courtship through to her time as secretary of State. As Hillary Clinton's husband for the past 40 years, the popular ex-president was her ultimate character witness, portraying her as hard-working, persistent, and caring.\n\nShe is \"the best darn change-maker I've ever met in my entire life,\" he said.\n\nOn Day Two of the Democratic National Convention, Mrs. Clinton made history by becoming the first woman nominee of a major-party for president of the United States. Mr. Clinton's task may have seemed deceptively simple: to add new dimensions to his wife's public image - elements of her life story that older voters may have forgotten and younger voters never knew as he walked through her early advocacy for children, her policy work as first lady, and her diplomatic ventures in the State Department.\n\nMr. Clinton is a master political operator, even Republicans agree. But helping to elect Hillary president of the United States may prove to be the toughest challenge of his life.\n\nEight years ago, when Mrs. Clinton ran for the Democratic nomination against Mr. Obama, Mr. Clinton stumbled at times and hurt her cause. He made comments that some interpreted as racially charged - such as when he compared Obama's 2008 victory in the South Carolina primary to that of civil rights leader Jesse Jackson in 1988. The suggestion seemed to be that Obama won South Carolina only because he's black.\n\nThis time around, Mr. Clinton has played a more low-key role in his wife's campaign, appearing at smaller events and fundraisers, and weighing in privately with advice. (He was reportedly a big backer of Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia for running mate.)\n\nYet Clinton has still at times thrown the campaign off-message. In April, while defending his wife's presidential bid, he sparred with Black Lives Matter protesters. In June, he lashed out at pro-Bernie Sanders hecklers, saying they'd be \"toast\" by Election Day.\n\nAdmirers of the former president cut him some slack, arguing that it can be harder to defend a loved one than oneself.\n\n\"Bill Clinton is the smartest, most articulate guy I've ever seen,\" says Don Fowler, chairman of the Democratic National Committee during Clinton's presidency. \"But like a lot of people, when someone attacks the dearest thing he knows, he loses a little precision.\"\n\nLate last month, Clinton raised eyebrows again when he met privately with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on the tarmac at Phoenix airport, right as the investigation into Mrs. Clinton's use of a private email server while secretary of State was coming to a head. Mr. Clinton says the two discussed grandchildren and golf.\n\nThe bigger challenge for Mr. Clinton may in fact be his record as president - a record that Mrs. Clinton also owns to some degree, for better or worse. The Democratic Party no longer has the centrist cast that Mr. Clinton helped to shape in the 1980s and '90s, when balancing the budget and moving people off welfare were the name of the game. The party is no longer even Mr. Obama's, in its new leftward tilt.\n\nOn issue after issue, Mr. Clinton has become \"explainer in chief\" for his own record. The North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, which Clinton implemented, is now under pressure from both Sanders and Donald Trump supporters.\n\nClinton has expressed regret for signing the 1994 crime bill, which led to mass incarcerations, particularly of minorities. He has also disavowed the Defense of Marriage Act, the 1996 law defining marriage as between a man and a woman, and the \"don't ask, don't tell\" compromise that kept gays in the military closeted.\n\nThe mere fact that the Clintons have to explain or refute old policies points to a deeper problem: that the Clintons are figures of the past in an election where voters are demanding change. Though Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, is of the same vintage as the Clintons, he's an outsider. The Clintons are the ultimate political insiders.\n\nAnd they form the nucleus of a potential political dynasty. Daughter Chelsea, who will introduce her mother on Thursday before her big acceptance speech, says she too may run for office someday . The failure of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in the Republican primaries signaled, in part, a rejection of dynastic politics in America.\n\nHere in Philadelphia, alive with politically engaged voters on both sides of the Democratic divide, the idea of politics as a family business gets mixed reactions.\n\n\"I didn't want it with the Bushes,\" says Sabrina Fedrigo, a Sanders delegate from Pennsylvania in her mid-20s. \"I don't want it with the Clintons. I don't want it with any family - we are not a monarchy.\"\n\nMs. Fedrigo agrees that people get excited seeing an ex-president out campaigning. But Mr. Clinton's record is problematic to her.\n\n\"He was impeached - and that's a big deal,\" she says. \"And for me, personally, it pushes me away from Hillary. I don't want to see him make any big decisions in office. He had his time, and he messed it up.\"\n\nMrs. Clinton has ruled out a cabinet position for her husband, but she has signaled a role for him focused on economic growth and job creation .\n\nBill Clinton's presidency was a time of relative peace and prosperity, including a balanced budget - a record that could redound to Mrs. Clinton's benefit in November, particularly with more moderate voters.\n\nTo some supporters, the Clintons are a two-fer, in a positive way.\n\n\"Does she need Bill? No. She can do it on her own,\" says Jordan Krsnak, a Clinton supporter from California and part of the \"Hollywood for Hillary\" team. \"But they're a great team. She helped him while he was in the White House. And will he be an asset to her while she's in the White House? Absolutely.\"\n\nOther Clinton voters made clear that they were supporting her solely on her merits, not her husband's.\n\nBill Clinton was a \"total non-factor\" in one delegate's decision to support Mrs. Clinton.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But is he as effective in this presidential campaign?\n\nLoading...\n\nJan. 16, 2016, 9:27 a.m. ET | Keene, N.H.\n\nBill Clinton promised voters in 1992 that they'd be getting \"two for the price of one\" if they elected him to the White House - a presidential duo of the young Arkansas governor and his Yale Law-educated wife.\n\nNearly a quarter century later, the duo is back - but not quite the same.\n\nAs Hillary Clinton fends off a rising challenge from Bernie Sanders, his wife's campaign aides are grappling with how best to deploy what she has described as her \"not-so-secret weapon.\"\n\nTheir answer: very, very carefully.\n\nDuring campaign swings through Iowa and New Hampshire, Bill Clinton treaded fastidiously through tightly controlled campaign events. A natural-born chit-chatter, he was not giving interviews. When he stopped to talk with reporters after one recent event, campaign aides turned up the music, making a conversation all but impossible.\n\nHis remarks to voters have been relatively subdued: long on history, statistics and nostalgia. He's dodged questions about Sanders and Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who's been baiting the Clinton family with comments about the former president's past sexual improprieties\n\n\"I'm not going there,\" Bill Clinton said on Wednesday, when asked about Sanders at a campaign event in New Hampshire. \"I came here to tell people why I thought Hillary should be president and her ideas are better.\"\n\nWhile Bill Clinton remains a popular figure among Democrats, some of the key achievements of his administration form the basis of Sanders' critique against his wife - that she's too willing to compromise liberal ideals for political gain.\n\nThe Vermont senator has denounced his rival's policies on trade, same-sex marriage, crime and welfare cuts. He's made reinstating Glass-Stegall, a Depression-era banking law repealed under Bill Clinton's administration, a central attack line of his campaign.\n\n\"People don't have a long memory, but Bernie's doing his best to remind them,\" said Roger Hickey, a co-director of the liberal Campaign for America's Future. \"People don't want a recycling of Bill Clinton's presidency. They want somebody who's willing to stand up to the billionaires and corporate power.\"\n\nClinton aides say those critiques miss the larger picture of wage growth, job creation and a balanced budget. In a debate last month, Clinton said she would turn to her husband for economic advice.\n\n\"He carries a message of peace and prosperity under his presidency and I think a lot of Americans would like to get back to those days,\" Clinton said in an interview on NBC's \"Today Show\" on Wednesday.\n\nAt an afternoon event in Keene, voters recalled the Clinton presidency fondly, as a time of prosperity.\n\n\"The best economic times for my family were when Bill Clinton was president,\" said Madeline Smeaton, a graduate student in Keene whose father lost her job in the Great Recession. \"We were making a lot of money.\"\n\nStill, some of those economic achievements face a skeptical re-examination within a party that's grown more liberal under the Obama administration.\n\nBill Clinton has said that he regrets approving the Defense of Marriage Act and the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy that banned gays and lesbians from military service. He also has looked back with regret on signing the 1994 crime bill, which led to tougher sentencing for drug offenses.\n\n\"I signed a bill that made the problem worse,\" the former president told an audience at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's annual meeting in Philadelphia in July. \"And I want to admit it.\"\n\nOn Wednesday in New Hampshire, Bill Clinton detailed the economic growth under his administration, listing statistics on wage growth, the decline in poverty and insurance rates.\n\nHe walked voters through Hillary Clinton's policy priorities, stressing the need to invest in infrastructure, renewable energy, small business, college affordability and paid leave. And he sprinkled his remarks with his wife's foreign policy and domestic accomplishments as first lady, New York senator and secretary of state.\n\n\"Whatever I say about Hillary's plans, you're entitled to give it a little discount,\" he said. \"But I ought to get some credit for knowing something about how to run the economy.\"\n\nIt's an argument similar to the one he made in 2007, when Hillary Clinton was fending off another insurgent challenger: then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama. But unlike eight years ago, when his comments about Obama \"playing the race card\" angered black voters, he made no mention of his wife's primary opponent.\n\nThe only veiled criticism of Sanders came Friday in Coralville, Iowa, with a reference to Sanders' support for a single-payer health care system instead of the 2010 federal health care law, also known as Obamacare.\n\nSaying that starting over on health care legislation was not politically viable, Clinton told voters, \"We still need to live in the reality-based world.\"\n\nIn New Hampshire, some people said that while Bill Clinton was still a compelling messenger for his wife, they just weren't sold on her quite yet.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\n\"He gave me every confidence that she'd be a great candidate and be a wonderful president,\" said Steve Taylor, a farmer from Plainfield, New Hampshire. \"But Bernie is telling the truth about the economy.\"\n\nBut Reuters reports that Bill Clinton doesn't carry as much influence with voters as he may have in the past.\n\nBill Clinton simply is not wielding that kind of influence - good or bad - over voters so far this year, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll . A majority of Americans, including 73 percent of Democrats and 52 percent of Republicans, said Bill Clinton does not factor into their opinion of Hillary for president. ()\n\nThe poll, conducted Jan. 7 to 13, found that 12 percent of Americans are more likely to vote for Hillary, the former secretary of state, because of her marriage to Bill. Among Democrats, fewer than half said Bill Clinton should be more prominent in his wife's campaign, and less than half felt that his presence in the race would boost her chances of winning.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

As the presidential campaign heats up, they hope the issue is included in platform agendas.\n\nLoading...\n\nApril 04, 2019, 12:40 p.m. ET | New York\n\nThe Democrats seeking the White House have issued proposals on overhauling education, agriculture, technology, and immigration. But none of the candidates has made specific pitches on how he or she would transform the nation's criminal justice system.\n\nAlthough the Democratic candidates have talked broadly about systemic racism - with several backing some form of reparations to the descendants of slaves - none has gone deep on mass incarceration or police reform.\n\nIt's an omission that has frustrated some activists who hoped such issues would receive greater attention in a Democratic primary that includes two black candidates and is dominated by an overall push to the left on many social fronts. Some are worried it's an early sign that candidates won't pay enough attention to voters of color.\n\n\"This is not a marginal issue,\" said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who is hosting several White House hopefuls this week at his annual social justice convention in New York. \"Are they going to keep consent decrees? Are they going to deal with mass commutations? They're going to have to deal with these questions.\"\n\nMr. Sharpton pressed some Democratic presidential contenders on the issue Wednesday during the first day of his National Action Network conference . Under questioning from Mr. Sharpton, former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke said he would reverse an order from President Donald Trump's Justice Department that restricted the federal government's ability to use court-enforced consent decrees when state and local law enforcement agencies are accused of abuse. Those agreements, popular during President Barack Obama's administration, generally provide a road map for changes in law enforcement practices.\n\n\"There must be accountability for enforcement of the law, there must be accountability for use of force, and federal funds to local police departments and sheriff's departments must be tied to accountability,\" Mr. O'Rourke said.\n\nOther candidates including Sen. Kamala Harris of California , Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg will appear at the conference in the coming days and could face similar questions.\n\nSuch venues present an opportunity for voters to hold candidates accountable on issues specific to the black community. Mr. Sharpton's conference is the year's first such gathering of civil rights leaders and activists featuring so many of the 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls.\n\nIt comes at an awkward moment for Democrats as Mr. Trump, who has little support among black voters, has sought to portray himself as an advocate for criminal justice. He's touted signing legislation last year aimed at addressing racially disparate federal prison sentences for crack cocaine offenses.\n\nAlthough they have avoided some specifics, multiple candidates have taken steps to address systemic racism.\n\nIn the Senate, Mr. Booker has reintroduced legislation to decriminalize marijuana , and he was a co-sponsor of the First Step Act targeting crack sentencing. Before running for president, Ms. Harris proposed bipartisan federal legislation to end cash bail. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called for criminal justice reform in her announcement speech in February but didn't offer details on what that would look like.\n\nSpeaking at Mr. Sharpton's conference on Wednesday, former San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro spoke powerfully of the need for reparations. Mr. O'Rourke said he would support legislation that would create a commission to study the issue.\n\n\"Criminal justice reform is not a second-tier issue for African Americans,\" said Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher. \"Particularly for younger African Americans, it is competing against, if not trumping, some rather conventional issues for the attention and concern of these voters. It is a very good issue to home in on, and it makes all the sense in the world for them to talk about it.\"\n\nCriminal justice reform was thrust into national politics in 2014 with the emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement, which highlighted the killings of black people by police and exposed patterns of bias in departments across the country. Under Mr. Trump, the Justice Department has generally taken a different stance on such issues, calling for less oversight and more praise of local law enforcement. In the years since, calls for reform have ushered in new local leadership, from district attorneys to mayors in cities like Chicago, St. Louis, Philadelphia, and Cleveland.\n\nThe 2020 Democratic primary offers a fresh opportunity and bigger stage to wrestle with criminal justice, particularly with the entry of Ms. Harris, whose credentials as a former prosecutor are part of her narrative and criticism, or the potential entry of former Vice President Joe Biden, who may have to reckon with his role as the Senate Judiciary chairman who presided over the passage of the 1994 crime bill.\n\nIt will likely not be the last time the candidates meet under such circumstances, with the National Urban League conference in Indianapolis and the NAACP convention happening in Detroit, both set for July. Black Lives Matter is also considering hosting a Democratic town hall during the primary.\n\nBut, Mr. Sharpton points out, his conference is the first and only convening ahead of the first Democratic debate in June in Miami, and he said he wants criminal justice reform on stage there.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nBrittany Packnett, who is active in the Black Lives Matter movement, echoed that hope. With so many Democrats seeking to gain a leg up in the primary, she said it's important that criminal justice \"doesn't completely fall off the agenda.\"\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "Biden's Mixed Messaging On Criminal Justice Reform\n\nBy Walter Pavlo\n\nBy Walter Pavlo ,\n\nContributor.\n\nNew York University Silver School of Social-Work\n\nThe Biden Administration, like the Trump Administration before it, should be commended for its commitment to criminal justice reform. President Biden designated April 2023 as Second Chance Month and recently gave commutations for individuals serving harsh sentences for drug offenses and pardons related to certain marijuana charges. It clearly demonstrated a willingness to address some of the injustices within our criminal justice system. However, there remains a critical aspect that requires immediate attention - the repeal of the '94 Crime Bill .\n\nI reached out to Terrence Coffie , an adjunct assistant professor at New York University Silver School of Social-Work, who writes and teaches on criminal justice reform. Coffie has a pragmatic view of the problems that the Crime Bill has caused because before teaching at NYU his first real academic accomplishment was earning his GED in 1993 at Florida's Marion Correctional Institution, while serving a five-year sentence for possession with intent to sell.\n\nCoffie told me, \"In light of extensive research, impassioned advocacy, and the \"new consensus\" emerging from the collective wisdom of elected officials and influential leaders, it is undeniably clear that the '94 Crime Bill stands as an outdated and draconian piece of legislation.\" Countless articles and tireless advocates have shed light on the consequences it has wrought, particularly in black and brown communities. Recognizing its role in perpetuating harm rather than fostering justice, there is an urgent and unequivocal call for the repeal of the '94 Crime Bill. Coffie, who is penned a personal appeal to President Joe Biden, believes it is a critical step towards rectifying historical injustices and forging a more equitable path forward for marginalized communities.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren's 2020 campaign gave a detailed and comprehensive plan for criminal justice reform, prominently featuring the repeal of the 1994 crime bill . In her proposal, Senator Warren acknowledged that the punitive 'tough on crime' approach embedded in the '94 Crime Bill was a mistake and needed to be repealed. She suggested retaining sections related to domestic violence while emphasizing that the bulk of the law must go. Her nuanced approach, supporting parts of the original bill that have since expired and would not be part of the repeal, reflects a thoughtful strategy to rectify the injustices perpetrated by this legislation.\n\nCoffie said of Warren's efforts, \"She understands the flawed nature of the '94 Crime Bill, and I implore President Biden to consider the urgency of its repeal.\" Coffie stated that Biden, then as U.S. Senator, was, like many democrats at the time, was instrumental in the 1994 Crime Bill. Coffie said of his request to Biden, \"The bill has had a lasting and detrimental impact on marginalized communities. Repealing it is not an erasure of the past but a courageous step towards acknowledging and rectifying the mistakes of history.\"\n\nCoffie said there are also other progressive measures that should be addressed by Congress and urged Biden's support. Senator Cory Booker's Next Step Act and Smart Sentencing Adjustments Act , both of which build on the momentum created by the First Step Act. The Next Step Act, introduced in 2019 and the 2023 Smart Sentencing Adjustments Act, stand as a continuation of the bipartisan efforts to reform our criminal justice system. Its provisions are carefully crafted to address critical issues such as sentencing reform, prison conditions, law enforcement training, and re-entry efforts.\n\nFederal funding, wielded to expand the criminal legal system, has played a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of incarceration. However, in a transformative shift, the Smart Sentencing Adjustments Act emerges as a beacon of change, poised to reverse this trend. This legislation not only seeks to rectify the punitive consequences of past policies but stands as a groundbreaking initiative to incentivize states in a diametrically opposite direction. By encouraging reductions in both incarceration rates and crime through innovative strategies, the Smart Sentencing Adjustments Act signifies a progressive step toward dismantling the punitive legacy of the 94 Crime Bill and fostering a criminal justice system rooted in fairness, rehabilitation, and community well-being.\n\n\"Biden's campaign promise to substantially reduce the federal prison population resonated with many,\" Coffie said, \"and his administration has taken commendable steps. However, it is evident that more needs to be done, especially as we witness the continued growth of the federal prison population under the current administration's tenure.\" President Donald Trump, demonstrated bipartisan support for sentencing reform through the First Step Act, resulting in the early release of nearly 30,000 individuals.\n\nTo Coffie, his pleas for change are personal, \"As an advocate, educator, and formerly incarcerated citizen who continues to support the Biden administration, I implore the president to recognize the importance of these issues, particularly as we approach the 2024 election cycle.\" Despite historical bipartisan support for sentencing reform, there is a growing concern that the relative inaction on this matter may impact key voting groups."

      "text": "Biden Sides With Republicans On A Bill To Reverse D.C. Criminal Justice Reforms-Here's Why\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he will support a GOP-backed bill that would reverse D.C.'s sweeping criminal justice reforms-a move that defies some members of his own party but allows him to evade Republican criticism that Democrats are soft on crime and avoid a potentially messier veto fight with Democrats in favor of the reversal.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in Covington, Kentucky on January 04, ... More 2023. (Photo by Peter Zay/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)\n\nBiden reportedly told Democrats on Thursday he would not veto the resolution if it passes Congress, then explained publicly that while he supports D.C.'s ability to self-govern, he opposes some of the provisions in the crime bill, \"such as lowering penalties for carjackings.\"\n\nBiden's tweet noted that D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) also vetoed the bill in January, when she said it sent the \"wrong message\" on crime prevention, but Bowser was overruled by the City Council and has since said she opposes \"any interference in our local laws.\"\n\nThe House in February voted 250-173 to reverse the D.C. legislation, with 31 Democrats voting with Republicans; it also voted 260-162, with 42 Democrats in favor, to nullify D.C. legislation that would give non-citizens the right to vote, though Biden has not said where he stands on the latter resolution.\n\nBiden's support for the Congressional resolution that would overrule the D.C. crime reforms is a reversal from his earlier statement saying he opposes the measure, though he did not explicitly say at the time he would veto it.\n\nSome House Democrats said they were surprised and upset by the president's announcement: One anonymous Democratic House member told The Hill Biden \"f***ed\" this up royally,\" and D.C.'s nonvoting delegate in Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton (D), called the decision \"paternalistic\" and \"anti-democratic.\"\n\nRep. Peter Aguilar (D-Calif.) told Punchbowl the decision was \"disappointing\" and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) tweeted that Biden \"should respect the people's gov of DC.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre defended the president's decision on Friday, telling reporters that vetoing the bill \"won't make D.C. a state,\" referring to Biden's pledge that he would back a D.C. statehood bill, while also noting that the D.C. crime reforms reduce maximum sentences \"for offenses like murders and other homicides, armed-home invasion, burglaries, armed carjackings . . . armed robberies, unlawful gun and some sexual assault offenses.\"\n\nCongress has statutory authority over D.C. and reviews all local legislation before it becomes law, but generally allows the council and mayor to self-govern. If the bill to overturn the new criminal justice code passes the Senate it would be the first time since 1991 that Congress voted to reverse a D.C. law.\n\n\"It's smart politics. He was running into a buzzsaw,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told reporters on Thursday. \"You don't want to get left of the D.C. mayor.\"\n\nThe D.C. Council in November voted to reform the district's criminal laws, a culmination of a 16-year effort to modernize the 122-year-old code. The bill, which takes effect in 2025, reduces penalties and strips away maximum sentencing requirements for some crimes, while giving misdemeanor defendants the right to a jury trial. In addition to injecting more fairness into the criminal justice process, the legislation was also designed to redefine certain crimes by degree of severity and eliminate overlap. Republicans and right-wing pundits promptly billed the legislation as an example of Democrats catering to criminals. Bowser, in vetoing the bill, cited not only its political pitfalls, but also the burden it could place on the courts and police to adapt to the new system.\n\nWhile the president's decision seems to defy the majority of Congressional Democrats, it also avoids a messy veto fight with senators who do plan to vote in favor. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Angus King (I-Maine) and Bob Casey (D-Pa.) said following the president's announcement that they will back the legislation, which could come before the Senate as early as next week.\n\n61%. That's the percentage of 5,098 U.S. adults surveyed by Pew Research Center in October who said violent crime was a top concern for them in making their midterm voting decisions. Republicans seized on the concerns and aired a barrage of negative attack ads against Democratic crime policies in the lead up to the election that cast their opponents as soft on crime. Democrats, meanwhile, made a concerted effort to flip the script by accusing GOP members who are sympathetic to January 6 Capitol rioters of being anti-law enforcement and tying Democratic-backed gun control measures to a reduction in crime. Biden has a generally moderate record on criminal justice reform-as a senator, he authored the sweeping 1994 crime bill that aimed to reverse decades of rising crime by enhancing federal sentencing requirements and providing more money to states and localities to hire police and build prisons. The legislation is widely viewed among liberals as a contributor to mass incarceration and the overcrowding of prisons and jails.\n\nBiden Bows to Republicans on Blocking D.C.

More U.S. coins, circa 1885.  (Photo by Kean Collection/Getty Images)\n\nThe recent developments and resignations within the Department of Justice under the leadership of newly appointed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi underscore the ongoing national debate over immigration policies, state autonomy and federal enforcement.\n\nBondi, a former lobbyist for one of the world's largest private prison and immigration detention companies, marked her first day in office by issuing a memo banning access to federal funds for \"sanctuary jurisdictions\" that provide protections for undocumented immigrants. The document was obtained by the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\nThe following day, Bondi filed a lawsuit against the City of Chicago, a prominent sanctuary jurisdiction. NBC News reported the lawsuit challenges the city's Welcoming City Ordinance and the Illinois TRUST Act. These laws restrict local law enforcement from participating in federal immigration enforcement and sharing individuals' immigration status with federal authorities.\n\nBondi escalated her legal efforts the following week by filing an additional lawsuit against New York State Governor Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James, CBS News reported. This lawsuit targeted New York's Green Light Law, which restricts the Department of Motor Vehicles from sharing information with federal immigration authorities and allows undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses.\n\nAs demonstrated on her first day in office, an attorney general has broad authority to issue directives and memoranda that shape policy and guide federal prosecutors in their case decisions. Additionally, attorney generals frequently collaborate with Congress to advocate for or against changes in federal law.\n\nThe first month of Bondi's tenure suggests that litigation threats and funding restrictions will be central tools in the DOJ's strategy to influence state legal systems and advance the Trump administration's immigration policies nationwide.\n\nThe power to withhold or provide federal funding has historically been an effective mechanism for enforcing presidential policies. A clear precedent for this approach is the Truth-in-Sentencing grant program, established through the 1994 Crime Bill - one of the most consequential pieces of criminal justice legislation in U.S. history. This program incentivized states to adopt harsher sentencing laws, ultimately exacerbating mass incarceration.\n\nTo qualify for TIS grants, states were required to impose sentencing policies mandating that violent offenders serve at least 85% of their prison sentences before becoming eligible for parole or early release. Additionally, states had to demonstrate compliance with federal truth-in-sentencing standards, leading many to eliminate parole . To receive funding, states had to show adequate prison capacity to accommodate more extended incarceration periods.\n\nWith these financial incentives, the DOJ effectively guided state sentencing policies. The program's impact was significant: within five years of its implementation, the U.S. incarceration rate became the highest in the world .\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Justice Statistics , Texas, Illinois, Florida, and New York were the initial top recipients of TIS grants, each receiving well over $100 million. California received the most funding, surpassing $500 million in federal grants.\n\nMuch like the Truth in Sentencing program, under Bondi's direction, the DOJ may develop financial incentives for local and state jurisdictions to align with the Trump administration's immigration policies. In her first DOJ memorandum, Bondi prohibited new grants or contracts that provide federal funding to non-governmental organizations that support or provide services to undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe strategy of leveraging federal funding to enforce policy priorities has historical precedent. During the Reagan administration, a similar approach was used to restrict class action lawsuits within legal aid work. This was primarily accomplished by imposing funding restrictions on the Legal Services Corporation, the federally funded entity that provides legal assistance to low-income individuals. Reagan's efforts were part of a broader conservative movement aimed at curtailing public interest litigation and reducing federal intervention in civil legal disputes. Though a complete ban on class actions in legal aid work was not finalized until congressional restrictions in 1996, Reagan laid the groundwork by targeting LSC funding.\n\nThe financial incentives and restrictions imposed by the DOJ and the broader Trump administration will force states to make difficult decisions about being funded or fined by the federal government.\n\nAs the federal government continues to wield financial influence over state policy, local governments across the country must weigh the cost of adhering to their social and political values against the economic repercussions of cutting ties with the purse strings of federal policy."

[+] reform legislation in the Oval Office of the White House, Friday, Dec. 21, 2018, in Washington. Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C, front row, second from right, watches. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nThe First Step Act, the the criminal justice reform bill enacted by President Donald Trump last year with bipartisan support, is beginning to take effect. While that is happening a debate over the 1994 crime bill is ramping up in tandem with the 2020 presidential campaign, with Joe Biden and President Trump already trading barbs over the matter.\n\nWhile these 2020 campaign-related events will get more headlines in the coming months, the most important developments on criminal justice reform are happening in state legislatures across the country. As Kevin Ring, president of FAMM Foundation , explained in the June 6 episode of the Cato Institute's daily podcast, \"most people are locked up in state prisons and jails, and so that's where most of the action is and should be.\"\n\nAs the halfway point of the year approaches, an examination of activity in statehouses finds both Republican and Democratic lawmakers continuing to introduce and implement more criminal justice reforms in 2019.\n\nTake Tennessee, where Governor Bill Lee (R) and Volunteer State lawmakers had a productive 2019 legislative session, enacting reforms to expand school choice and provide more tax relief . While it didn't get as much media coverage as the education reform bills, Governor Lee and Tennessee lawmakers also built upon the state's criminal justice reform record this year.\n\nGovernor Lee made clear early on that criminal justice reform would be a priority for his administration, mentioning it during the January State of the State Address that outlined his first year agenda. In fact, the criminal justice reforms enacted in Tennessee this year are projected to yield savings that could facilitate further tax relief and other reforms in the future. According to fiscal notes for two sentencing reform measures that were passed in Tennessee this year ( HB 167/SB 403 & HB 197/SB 215 ), they account for 94% of the taxpayer savings legislatively enacted in Tennessee this year.\n\n\"Both of these measures are part of our much broader plan to overhaul our current system of justice so that we can continue to remain tough on crime and hold violent offenders accountable, but also smart on crime and better prepare those who have paid their debt to society for successful reentry,\" said Tennessee House Judiciary Committee Chairman Michael Curcio (R-Dickson). \"These and other initiatives passed in 2019 and in the years ahead will ultimately reduce recidivism rates, save additional taxpayer dollars, further our efforts to create safe communities, and guarantee Tennessee remains a national leader on criminal justice reform.\"\n\nKentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, left, and Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee take part in a discussion on state-level ... [+] criminal justice reform, Wednesday, April 17, 2019, in Nashville, Tenn. (AP Photo/Mark Humphrey)\n\n\"House Bill 167 not only equates to a substantial cost savings for our taxpayers, it also makes communities across Tennessee safer,\" said House Majority Leader William Lamberth (R-Portland). \"This bill and our ongoing work modernizing our criminal justice system will guarantee we have a system of justice that can keep up with present-day demands, cracks down on the worst of the worst, and also supports those who desire to work towards prosperity.\"\n\nThis comes on the heels of the 2018 enactment of Tennessee's Juvenile Justice Reform Act, whose fiscal note shows it will save Tennessee taxpayers more than four million dollars annually. Julie Warren, Right On Crime's Tennessee & Kentucky director, explains why that 2018 reform was meaningful:\n\n\"The Act will require that stakeholders develop a data collection infrastructure and performance measures to better track outcomes for youth and improve cross-agency information-sharing. It will also ensure that Tennessee invests its limited public safety dollars into the most effective community-based programs, expanding the use of these programs for youth who would otherwise be placed in out-of-home facilities...While the Act only adopted several of the Task Force recommendations, it's an important first step that will lay the foundation for further reforms.\"\n\nTennessee is not the only state where criminal justice reform legislation has been introduced this year. Nevada lawmakers recently passed Assembly Bill 236 , a sentencing reform measure that, like those enacted in Tennessee, will yield significant taxpayer savings.\n\n\"This legislation establishes crisis intervention training and alternatives to jail for those with behavioral health needs,\" writes Americans for Tax Reform's Laurel Duggan about Nevada's AB 236. \"This will ensure that this population receives the help they need to no longer threaten public safety. The bill creates graduated sanctions for parolees, replacing the system in which technical violations result in reflexive imprisonment...The resulting decrease in incarceration is projected to save taxpayers $543 million over ten years.\"\n\nPennsylvania lawmakers, unlike those in Tennessee, are still in session. Criminal justice reform advocates in the Keystone State are encouraging lawmakers in Harrisburg to pass Senate Bill 637 , legislation that would have professional licensing and permitting boards consider applicants' criminal records individually and in the context of the profession they seek to enter, as opposed to the current practice in many instances of barring them automatically.\n\nIf SB 637 is passed by the Republican-controlled Pennsylvania General Assembly and signed by Governor Tom Wolf (D), Pennsylvania licensing boards will discern the relevance of criminal convictions for the profession at hand. Boards will retain the right to reject an applicant based on criminal convictions relevant to the license. Proponents of this reform see this as a significant improvement to the current approach, in which former offenders are blacklisted from the job market and evidence of rehabilitation is not taken into account.\n\nPolicy Innovation Through Federalism\n\nDozens of states passed criminal justice reforms that served as a model for the First Step Act signed into law by President Trump last year. The experience in those states demonstrated how increasing alternatives to incarceration for non-violent offenders can save state taxpayer dollars, reduce recidivism, and keep families together, all without jeopardizing public safety.\n\n\"Overall, in the 10 states that have reduced incarceration the most over the last decade, crime has fallen more than the national average and more than in the 10 states that increased incarceration the most,\" says Marc Levin -Vice President of Criminal Justice Policy at the Texas Public Policy Foundation . \"Federal policymakers could act on the First Step Act knowing that it is not an experiment, but rather legislation that is grounded in successful reforms on the state level.\"\n\nEven those who are strictly focused on the federal government should pay attention to what is happening in the states. Criminal justice reform is one area in particular where state level reforms have successfully percolated up to the national level. It's a template for successful policy innovation that more politicians and candidates would do well to follow. Before taking something national; the success of criminal justice reform shows that it's wise to use a few of the 50 laboratories of democracy to first show the nation that a given policy works and how best to implement."

      "text": "Postsecondary Education In Prison Benefits Communities And Saves Taxpayer Dollars\n\nBy Vera Institute of Justice\n\nBy Vera Institute of Justice ,\n\nBrand Contributor.\n\nBy Margaret diZerega, Director of the Center on Sentencing and Corrections, Vera Institute of Justice\n\nThese days, bipartisan agreement is rare, but there's one issue that's drawn support from all sides : the importance of providing access to postsecondary education for people in prison.\n\nResearch shows that for people who are incarcerated, participating in college programs not only improves their lives and those of their families but also benefits entire communities. Ninety-five percent of people in prison eventually return home . With a college degree, they're better positioned to secure well-paying jobs, find stable housing, and provide for their families. People who participate in college-in-prison programs are also 48 percent less likely to return to prison , which could cut state prison spending across the country by as much as $365.8 million annually. And every dollar invested in prison-based education saves taxpayers four to five dollars from reduced incarceration costs .\n\nEducation is transformative , and people who have been able to access higher education while incarcerated say that it made them feel hopeful, confident, and empowered.\n\n\"Postsecondary education in prison changed the trajectory of my life,\" said Daniela Medina, who received her associate's degree while incarcerated and went on to receive a bachelor's in social welfare and a master's in social work from the University of California, Berkeley. \"It gave me the opportunity to do what I always dreamed of.\"\n\nAnd yet, only a small percentage of the 1.8 million people incarcerated in the United States have access to higher education. But that will soon change. Last December, Congress overturned a 26-year ban on Pell Grants for incarcerated students. The long-standing ban, part of the ill-conceived 1994 crime bill, made getting a college education almost impossible for incarcerated people. When incarcerated students' access to this need-based aid dissolved, college-in-prison programs disappeared almost entirely: there were only eight in 1997 , down from 772 in the early 1990s .\n\nThe new law, which will take effect no later than July 1, 2023, offers hope to hundreds of thousands of people: up to 463,000 people who are currently incarcerated will be eligible for this financial aid .\n\nThe Vera Institute of Justice, along with our partners in corrections and higher education and advocates for criminal legal system reform, called for the reversal of the ban on Pell Grants. A key development in advocates' efforts came in 2015, when the U.S. Department of Education (ED) launched the Second Chance Pell (SCP) Experimental Sites Initiative, a pilot program that allows select colleges to administer Pell Grants for incarcerated students.\n\nThe success of SCP shows the impact that lifting the Pell ban will have. In the years since SCP launched, more than 22,000 students across the country have been able to enroll in higher education programs in prison , and 7,000 of them have been awarded certificates and degrees. With Pell Grant eligibility reinstated for all incarcerated students, more students will have access to more postsecondary programs in prison.\n\nBut the work isn't over. With the reversal of the ban, we must ensure that postsecondary education programs are high quality and that all students have the support they need to complete their programs and find well-paying jobs after they leave prison.\n\nThis work must also address the systemic racism inherent in our system of incarceration, which harms Black and brown communities most. Black and Latinx people make up roughly 32 percent of the U.S. population, but 56 percent of those incarcerated. Providing equitable access to college in prison that can lead to employment-and greater opportunity-is one way to chip away at wealth disparities .\n\nVera estimates that expanded access to higher education in prison will increase combined wages earned by all formerly incarcerated people by about $45.3 million in the first year of release. And a growing number of employers -including Accenture, JP Morgan Chase & Co., and Target-have committed to creating meaningful employment opportunities for people coming out of prison.\n\nNow is the time for colleges, universities, and employers to partner together and with corrections departments to help create these opportunities and make higher education a reality for students who are incarcerated ( Vera has created a guide for those seeking to set up new college-in-prison programs). Business leaders can also advance racial justice -and strengthen their own organizations-by expanding hiring practices to include this talented but often neglected pool of applicants . Removing barriers to education and employment benefits us all.\n\nThis is a content marketing post from a Forbes EQ participant. Forbes brand contributors' opinions are their own."

      "text": "The Debates Ignored Mental Health. Here's Where Trump And Biden Stand\n\nBy Graison Dangor\n\nBy Graison Dangor , Former Staff.\n\nBy Graison Dangor ,\n\nFormer Staff.\n\nMental health issues have been largely absent from the debates.\n\nThe mental health crisis stemming from the loss and isolation of the coronavirus pandemic is not on the agenda for the second and final presidential debate Thursday night, nor is the steadily rising number of people dying by suicide and overdose, nor is the shortage of mental health providers who could have helped them. These issues were ignored almost entirely in the first debate and the following town halls by the moderators and both candidates.\n\nBut data is beginning to show the toll of the parallel mental health pandemic. Three times as many adults have had symptoms of an anxiety disorder, depressive disorder or both during the Covid-19 pandemic compared to the first half of 2019 , according to surveys by the CDC. In mid-July, four in 10 adults showed signs of a disorder.\n\nDespite the spike, there were only passing references to the treatment of mental illness or substance use. Responding to questions about winning support from Black voters and his role writing the 1994 crime bill, former Vice President Joe Biden briefly mentioned support for hiring more school psychologists , decriminalizing marijuana, diverting drug cases from criminal courts and sending mental health professionals with police on crisis calls during his town hall.\n\n\"We just have not seen a lot of conversation around mental health policy leading up to the election,\" said Nirmita Panchal, a mental health policy analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation and co-author of an article comparing the candidates' proposals.\n\nA debate of the candidates' mental health plans should start with their overall proposals for health insurance coverage, said Sherry Glied, a professor specializing in mental healthcare policy and the dean of New York University's graduate school of public service.\n\n\"You can have a mental health plan, and it can be as lovely as you'd like it to be. But if people don't have health insurance coverage it isn't going to get you very far,\" said Glied, an assistant health secretary in the Obama administration who helped represent the Biden campaign on a task force bridging policy differences with defeated rival Sen. Bernie Sanders. Both candidates have mentioned the Affordable Care Act, with Biden backing President Obama's signature health care plan and President Trump condemning it. More than 20 million people gained health insurance coverage under Obamacare, including more than 14 million people enrolling in Medicaid.\n\nGlied criticized Trump's attempts to roll back the Affordable Care Act and his policies allowing states to reduce Medicaid coverage and add work requirements. \"If people are getting kicked off Medicaid,\" she said, \"all the opioid plans you have in the world are not going to do any good.\"\n\nNeither the Trump campaign nor Biden campaign provided comment on their mental health plans.\n\nMost of the recent expansions of mental health coverage came through the ACA. The law made mental healthcare an Essential Health Benefit for many health plans, extended the mandate to equally cover mental and physical health benefits to more types privately managed health plans and required most insurers to cover pre-existing conditions, including serious mental illness. Trump has not proposed replacements for those protections apart from an executive order on pre-existing conditions that has been criticized as vague and unenforceable .  If the Supreme Court strikes down the law - which it has the chance to do in its upcoming term - \"we would likely see a reduction in coverage for mental health services,\" said Panchal.\n\nAnother challenge to the expanded mental health coverage comes from cheap short-term insurance plans that do not have to abide by the ACA's requirements to cover pre-existing conditions or mental healthcare. The Obama administration cut the length of these plans to three months, but in 2018, the Trump administration lengthened the maximum coverage to three years.\n\nBiden has said he will expand and enforce the ACA and the 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, which required most types of health plans to equally cover mental and physical health benefits. More than a decade after the parity act was passed, the federal government has failed to stop insurance companies from using some practices that deny or delay mental health services. But Biden \"hasn't offered a detailed plan of what [it] would look like\" to enforce the law, said Panchal.\n\nNeither candidate offers many details on how they would address the shortage of mental health providers. Trump's 2021 budget proposes increasing funding for behavioral workforce development to $139 million a year. Biden hopes to double the ranks of school mental health providers such as guidance counselors and psychologists. Whomever wins, their plans will have a lot of detail to fill in if their administration hopes to solve a projected shortage of 12,000 adult psychiatrists in 2030 - a third of the total field. The Health Resources & Service Administration also forecasts a shortage of more than 11,500 addiction counselors, due to increasing demand for their services.\n\nTrump and Biden have more detailed plans for preventing suicide, which has been increasing steadily for the last two decades . Each focuses their plans on veterans, who die by suicide at a rate 1.5 times higher than non-veterans. For veterans in mental health crises, Biden has proposed hiring more mental health staff for emergency rooms and staffing crisis phone lines so calls aren't missed. Trump announced a national strategy in June that aims to coordinate research and funding for veterans and the general population among federal, state and local governments as well as universities and nonprofits. His 2021 budget proposes increasing funding for suicide prevention programs at the Department of Veterans Affairs by 30%, and a $3 million increase for SAMHSA grants that would help screen an additional half-million people for risk of suicide. The pandemic emergency CARES Act passed in March adds another $50 million in funding for suicide prevention.\n\nOther groups at higher risk of suicide are given comparatively little attention. Neither Trump's campaign nor White House website mentions the unique risk of suicide for LGBTQ teens, who are more than three times as likely to attempt suicide than their straight peers. Biden says he will \"work to end suicide among young LBGTQ+ individuals\" but does not propose any policies that would address the challenge specifically.\n\nIf you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) or text the Crisis Text Line at 741-741.\n\nKaiser Family Foundation\n\nBiden for President - Health Care\n\nPresident Trump's Executive Order on An America-First Healthcare Plan"

Harris discussed President Donald Trump's failure to handle the COVID-19 pandemic and protect working families from the economic fallout prior to the last night of the Republican National Convention. (Photo by Michael A. McCoy/Getty Images)\n\n\"I condemn violence in any form,\" Biden said in an interview with MSNBC, claiming Trump is \"rooting for the violence\" and \"pouring gasoline on the fire\" because he \"views it as a political benefit.\"\n\nHarris echoed Biden's condemnation in a speech later that day, stating that she will \"always defend peaceful protests and protesters,\" but that \"we should not confuse them with looting and committing acts of violence.\"\n\nHarris also called out the \"shooter who was arrested for murder,\" in Kenosha, declaring \"we will not let these vigilantes and extremists derail the path to justice.\"\n\nThe remarks come amid a GOP convention in which many speeches have been underpinned by the notion that Biden and Democrats have enabled protests by failing to call out violence - though Biden criticized \"needless destruction\" and \"violence that endangers lives\" at George Floyd protests in May.\n\n\"You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America,\" Vice President Mike Pence said in his RNC acceptance speech on Wednesday, pointing to violence in cities that Biden noted is happening \"in Donald Trump's America,\" and accusing Biden of wanting to \"defund the police,\" despite Biden explicitly opposing that policy.\n\nSimultaneously, the GOP convention has showcased several speakers slamming Biden's work on the 1994 Crime Bill and Harris' record as a prosecutor, attempting to paint Trump as the true criminal justice advocate despite his harsh attitude towards protesters and vandals in recent months.\n\n\"Biden's crime bill, perhaps his signature legislative accomplishment, was the accursed product of the police lobbying group the National Association of Police Organizations - and with Biden, everything they wanted, they got,\" Cato Institute's David D'Amato wrote in The Hill , not mentioning that NAPO endorsed Trump, with NAPO President Michael McHale speaking at the GOP Convention on Wednesday.\n\nIn spite of Biden and Harris' condemnations, Republicans have continued to hammer them over protest violence. \"It's too little too late, he has been silent two and a half months,\" Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), who spoke at the convention on Wednesday, said in an interview with Fox & Friends on Thursday. \"They are now talking about this, because they know that as voters are watching their TV screens and concerned about the safety and security in their community.\"\n\n\"The more chaos and anarchy and violence reign, the better it is for who is the clear choice for who's best on public safety and law and order,\" Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said in a Fox & Friends interview, a remark that seems to have been the impetus for Biden's allegation that Trump sees \"political benefit\" in protest violence.\n\nThe final night of the Republican convention will doubtless feature more accusations of Biden being soft on crime. Speakers for the night include Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who infamously advocated for military intervention in George Floyd protests, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who joined Trump when he received an endorsement from the New York Police Benevolent Association, and NYPBA President Patrick Lynch, as well as Trump himself. The Biden campaign preempted the speeches in a statement , telling viewers, \"When Donald Trump says tonight you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America, look around and ask yourself: How safe do you feel in Donald Trump's America?\"\n\nOne Community.

For those applying to President Joe Biden's White House intern program for the fall, prior cannabis use-even in a state where it is legal-could be a disqualifier.\n\nUnder the eligibility requirements, published this week in a frequently-asked-questions page on the White House intern program website, a candidate who makes it through the application process will have to fill out what's known as Standard Form 86 to see if they meet security requirements. Among the factors that can negatively affect an applicant's eligibility are a connection to a foreign government, a criminal record, unpaid taxes and debts and prior drug use-\"including marijuana, regardless of whether the marijuana use was permitted under state law.\"\n\nThis should come as no surprise-this is not a new policy for the Biden White House. Back in March 2021, The Daily Beast broke a story about how a handful of Biden Administration staffers were fired for marijuana use. (Then-White House press secretary Jen Psaki later confirmed that five staffers were terminated .)\n\nThe message was clear: In the executive branch of government, federal law supersedes state law and marijuana is still a banned substance. After the weed-related firings, Politico referred to President Biden's moves as being the \"Same Old Joe.\" When he was a Senator, Biden helped usher in the 1994 crime bill, the overly punitive law that created mandatory minimum sentencing for drug convictions.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment. Marijuana Moment first reported the details of state-sanctioned cannabis use still being an obstacle for the White House intern program.\n\nWhile Biden remains opposed to cannabis legalization, on the campaign trail in 2020, he did suggest that he supported decriminalization. Last year, Jen Psaki told reporters that Biden supports a state's right to legalize recreational marijuana but hasn't changed his mind about federal legalization . Now that 37 states have some form of legal sales and the majority of Americans support legalization, a policy like this seems \"ridiculous,\" says Weldon Angelos, a marijuana law reform activist who visited the White House in April. \"That's terrible they are still using that criterion and it's hypocritical to what Biden said on the campaign trail,\" he says.\n\nIn April, Angelos, who founded the nonprofit the Weldon Project that seeks to get people out of prison, met with President Biden's senior advisors to discuss granting clemency to people who are serving time for non-violent federal marijuana offenses. There are roughly 2,700 federal cannabis prisoners and Angelos says Biden's team assured him that \"this is going to happen.\"\n\nAngelos has good reasons to have faith in the Oval Office. In 2016, President Obama granted Angelos-who was serving 55 years for selling about $1,000 worth of weed to an informant-a reduced sentence after 13 years of prison time. Then in 2020, President Trump gave him a full pardon .\n\nAngelos then teamed up with political advocacy group Americans For Prosperity (founded by billionaire Charles Koch ), and other pro-legalization organizations to form the Cannabis Freedom Alliance, whose members are now lobbying Congress to lift America's federal marijuana ban.\n\n\"[The policy] doesn't make sense,\" Angelos says. \"In states where it's legal, it's no different than alcohol.\"\n\nPrior marijuana use doesn't always get in the way of employment at the White House-as long as you have one of the top two jobs. Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton admitted to lighting up in their youth, as did Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBut in 2017, Alyssa Mastromonaco, who served as President Obama's Deputy Chief of Staff, chronicled her close call with unemployment after admitting to the FBI that she smoked weed more than 500 times .\n\n\"That night I went home and flushed all the pot I had stashed in my underwear drawer,\" she wrote in Vice . \"Though my usage peaked well after college, pot had been a friend for a very long time.\"\n\nThe feds decided that Mastromonaco wasn't a security risk and she kept her job, although she did get drug tested regularly throughout her tenure in the Obama Administration. \"I was very lucky to be able to keep my job at the White House,\" Mastromonaco recalled. \"Everyone should get the same chance that I did.\""

(Photo by MANDEL NGAN / AFP) (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black ,\" the former vice president said on the syndicated radio show.\n\nBiden was responding to co-host Charlamagne tha God asking for the chance to speak to Biden again, saying \"we've got more questions.\"\n\nCharlamagne tha God challenged Biden at several points about his history on racial issues, which were brought up many times during the Democratic primary debates after Biden touted the good working relationship he had with segregationists during his early years in the Senate.\n\nThe host also questioned whether Biden was considering choosing a black woman as his running mate, after Biden already promised that he would pick a woman for the role.\n\nBiden responded by saying there \"are multiple black women being considered\" before an aide spoke up and attempted to cut the interview short, beginning the back-and-forth between Biden and Charlagmagne tha God that led to Biden's comment.\n\nDespite defending his support of the 1994 crime bill, Biden said on the radio show that no one should go to jail for a drug crime - especially marijuana - saying \"I know a lot of weed smokers.\"\n\nThe comments set off a social media firestorm Friday morning, with numerous commentators saying that the comments were racist, or - at best - a terrible choice of words.\n\nBiden's history when it comes to racial issues became a major talking point on the Democratic campaign trail, with the former vice president regularly taking criticism from fellow candidates for not being progressive enough in the past. Perhaps the most memorable moment from the debates came in July of 2019, when Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) challenged Biden for opposing having the federal government institute bussing as a way to desegregate schools .\n\nBiden became the presumptive Democratic nominee on April 8, after Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced he was suspending his campaign.\n\nThis isn't the first time Biden has made controversial comments to a black audience, saying during a 2012 campaign speech for Barack Obama's reelection that Republican economic policies would \"put y'all back in chains.\"\n\nBiden Defends Comments About Working With Segregationist Lawmakers (NPR)\n\nHere's Who Joe Biden Is Considering For Vice President (Forbes)\n\nOne Community.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden 's role in authoring a controversial 1994 crime bill received both ridicule and support this week from bipartisan figures who say President Bill Clinton , Black leaders and news media \"overreaction\" helped pass the legislation that was widely popular at the time.\n\nBiden on Thursday apologized for his \"mistake\" in supporting a 1986 bill that created wide racial disparities in crack cocaine sentencing as well as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which he authored. Fox News host Tucker Carlson and MSNBC host Al Sharpton on Friday both sought to explain Biden's chief role in passing the crime bills that are widely derided today by both Democrats and President Donald Trump for spiking incarceration rates, targeting young Black men, and widening racial disparities in the criminal justice system still present today.\n\nA pocket of Black lawmakers were convinced to support the 1994 bill by President Bill Clinton-including late civil rights icon John Lewis of Georgia. But they \"got almost nothing in return\" for their last-minute backing, The Baltimore Sun reported at the time.\n\nCarlson defended Biden's move to end \"drug-fueled crime\" throughout the U.S. in the 1980s and 1990s, which he said was prompted by a drug epidemic and ensuing murder crisis that drew overwhelming demands for \"tough on crime\" action nationwide.\n\n\"The majority of the Congressional Black Caucus supported the crime bill they're now telling us was written by the Klan,\" the Fox News host said Friday night. \"By the way, the Republicans are saying that too, mindlessly. Joe Biden knows these bill weren't mistakes. We don't put people in jail in this country for being Black. We didn't do that in the 1980's and 90's. Sorry. People go to jail for committing crimes.\"\n\nThe crime bills held wide support from Black pastors and 28 of 38 members of the Congressional Black Caucus at the time, including the chairman of the Black Caucus who co-sponsored the 1986 crack cocaine sentence law. Carlson defended Biden's role in promoting the bills, while Sharpton said \"he was not alone,\" but has since worked to right the wrong.\n\nCritics, including civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, railed against Biden and the 1994 crime bill in testimony at the time. Jackson ridiculed the legislation in a congressional floor speech, saying: \"Twelve years of getting 'tough on crime,' doubling government spending almost 50 percent, tripling the jail population, reviving the death penalty.\"\n\nSharpton highlighted Trump's support of a national stop-and-frisk policy during his 2016 campaign and said the president has done nothing to commute unfair sentences for people who committed non-violent drug crimes. Sharpton defended Biden following Thursday's debate, in which Biden referred to both pieces of legislation as a \"mistake.\" The National Action Network leader said Biden worked with former President Barack Obama to commute sentences.\n\n\"In 1994, I was one of the people marching against the crime bill and against Senator Biden. Many of the black leaders were for the crime bill, most of the Congressional Black Caucus was,\" Sharpton told MSNBC Friday, noting the June 1986 overdose death of basketball player Len Bias sparked widespread outrage\n\nCarlson said Biden's anti-crime legislation \"enormously popular\" due to a 1980s drug epidemic and ensuing crime wave which spiked murder rates across much of the country.\n\nDuring last Thursday's debate, Biden described how he plans to move forward and erase some of the mistakes from his past support of the now-derided legislation. Critics of Biden's campaign have promoted video clips of Biden's Senate floor warnings of \"predators on our streets\" who were \"beyond the pale.\"\n\n\"We should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense, they should be going into treatment across the board. That's why I set up drug courts which were never funded by our Republican friends,\" Biden said.\n\nThe 1994 legislation authored by Biden was the largest crime bill in U.S. history. It was sponsored by Representative Jack Brooks of Texas and funded 100,000 new police officer positions, $10 billion for prisons, and $6.1 billion in prevention programs aimed at heading off criminal activity.\n\nTen of the 38 Black Democrats in the House voted against Biden and Clinton when the bill was put up for a procedural motion, primarily over the death penalty being applied to dozens of cases viewed as wrongful.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Biden and Trump campaigns as well as Jackson's office for comment.\n\nBenjamin Fearnow is a reporter based out of Newsweek's New York City offices.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has taken a swipe at Joe Biden over the Democrat's involvement with the 1994 Crime Bill, touting his own credentials as a criminal justice reformer in his attack on the former vice president and 2020 candidate.\n\nTrump made reference to the \"super predator\" phrase popularized in the mid-1990s by John DiIulio and largely used to describe young black males who committed violent crime. It was a phrase used at the time by the then first lady Hillary Clinton .\n\nBiden, the former Delaware Senator and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, helped the then President Bill Clinton to draft and pass the Crime Bill. The legacy of the fiercely controversial legislation hangs over Biden's bid to secure the Democratic Party's nomination for the presidency.\n\nTo its many critics, the bill-known formally as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act- deepened America's mass incarceration problem and worsened racial inequality in the justice system. To its supporters, it aided a sharp drop in crime.\n\n\"Super Predator was the term associated with the 1994 Crime Bill that Sleepy Joe Biden was so heavily involved in passing. That was a dark period in American History, but has Sleepy Joe apologized? No!\" Trump tweeted on Monday.\n\n\"Anyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected. In particular, African Americans will not be able to vote for you. I, on the other hand, was responsible for Criminal Justice Reform, which had tremendous support, & helped fix the bad 1994 Bill!\"\n\nBiden did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nAmong the 1994 Crime Bill's provisions were greater resources for existing and new prisons, harsher punishments including for drug offenses, and an expansion of the death penalty.\n\nIt offered more federal money for states that adopted the \"truth-in-sentencing\" laws, which ensured violent offenders serve at least 85 percent of their sentences.\n\nAnd the crime bill introduced the \"three strikes\" rule that gave mandatory life sentences without parole to people convicted of three or more serious violent felonies or drug trafficking crimes.\n\n\"It has been well-documented that these policies were failures,\" concluded a report by the Center for American Progress , a liberal think tank, which analyzed the Crime Bill's impact.\n\n\"Their cost to society came not only from the staggering amount of taxpayer dollars that were invested in enforcement, but also from the disproportionate incarceration of a generation of African American men in the name of public safety.\n\n\"Moreover, tough-on-crime measures-specifically longer incarceration sentences-have had at best a marginal effect on improving public safety.\"\n\nIn 2016, Biden said he is not ashamed of his role in writing the 1994 Crime Bill and defended its record. \"The problem is institutional racism in America. That's the overarching problem that still exists and we should be talking about,\" Biden told CNBC .\n\n\"But having said that, if you take a look at the Crime Bill, of the money in the Crime Bill the vast majority went to reducing sentences. Diverting people from going to jail for drug offenses into what I came up with-drug courts.\n\n\"Providing for boot camps instead of sending people to prison so you didn't relearn whatever the bad thing [was] that got you there in the first place. Put 100,000 cops on the street.\"\n\nBill Clinton has acknowledged the problems with the 1994 Crime Bill. \"I signed a bill that made the problem worse,\" Clinton told the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's 2015 annual meeting in Philadelphia, CNN reported. \"And I want to admit it.\"\n\nHe continued: \"In that bill, there were longer sentences. And most of these people are in prison under state law, but the federal law set a trend. And that was overdone. We were wrong about that...The good news is we had the biggest drop in crime in history. The bad news is we had a lot of people who were locked up, who were minor actors, for way too long.\"\n\nIn December, President Trump signed the First Step Act into law . The act reformed the federal prison system by allowing a greater number of inmates to earn early release through recidivism reduction programs.\n\nHowever, the reform's impact on mass incarceration will likely be small. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, there are just 180,835 federal inmates, compared to the circa two million held in state prisons.\n\n\"This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community,\" Trump said in his 2019 State of the Union address.\n\n\"The First Step Act gives nonviolent offenders the chance to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, states across the country are following our lead. America is a nation that believes in redemption.\"\n\nWriting for the Weekly Standard in 1995, John Dilulio blamed a rise in violent crime committed by young people on the \"abject moral poverty\" in which they grew up and the \"unmerciful abuse\" they suffered as children, and dubbed them \"super-predators.\"\n\n\"On the horizon, therefore, are tens of thousands of severely morally impoverished juvenile super-predators,\" Dilulio wrote. \"They are perfectly capable of committing the most heinous acts of physical violence for the most trivial reasons (for example, a perception of slight disrespect or the accident of being in their path).\n\n\"They fear neither the stigma of arrest nor the pain of imprisonment. They live by the meanest code of the meanest streets, a code that reinforces rather than restrains their violent, hair-trigger mentality.\n\n\"In prison or out, the things that super-predators get by their criminal behavior-sex, drugs, money-are their own immediate rewards. Nothing else matters to them. So for as long as their youthful energies hold out, they will do what comes 'naturally': murder, rape, rob, assault, burglarize, deal deadly drugs, and get high.\"\n\nShane Croucher is a Breaking News Editor based in London, UK.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nIn a highly controversial move this weekend, President Joe Biden did something that he repeatedly promised he would not do: He pardoned his son, Hunter Biden , who was found guilty of crimes relating to the illegal purchase of a firearm and of tax violations. Hunter has been given a \"full and unconditional pardon\" by his father.\n\nExplaining his rationale, President Biden essentially alleged that his son's legal troubles were the result of a politically motivated witch hunt, and that his Justice department carried out a \"miscarriage of justice\" against his own son. The \"no one is above the law\" refrain that Biden and others used against President-elect Donald Trump when he had his legal problems evaporated in the blink of an eye.\n\nTo be honest, I don't care that the President pardoned his son. I never believed him when he said that he wouldn't do it. And if I were in his position and Hunter was my son, I'd at least consider doing the same.\n\nWhat I do care about, however, is the fact that President Biden was the author of the laws that locked up many Black men for doing some of the same crimes that Hunter was just pardoned for.\n\nAs a senator, Biden was one of the authors of the law that his son violated, the prohibition against drug addicts owning guns. He has repeatedly bragged about his involvement in creating virtually every major crime law of the 1980s and 1990s. His push to create a federal \"drug czar\" and went so far that even Ronald Reagan vetoed it.\n\nMoreover, one of the most egregious acts of the Biden legislative legacy was the outrageous sentencing disparity between those in possession of crack cocaine and powder cocaine. Now consider that Hunter was seen multiple times on tape smoking crack cocaine and wasn't even charged with possession, while thousands of Black and Hispanic Americans were harmed by the disparate sentencing that Joe Biden supported.\n\nSupporters of the President argue that Hunter would not have been prosecuted if he wasn't Joe Biden's son. Even the President alleged that in his explanation letter. Eric Holder , former Attorney General in the Obama administration, said on X, \"Had his name been Joe Smith the resolution would have been - fundamentally and more fairly - a declination.\"\n\nWell, if Hunter Biden was Hunter Smith from inner city Chicago or Cleveland, he would probably be in prison for multiple years. Hunter Smith would have already been a felon, because he would've been convicted for possession of crack cocaine. Then, if Hunter Smith was caught with a gun, he would've been convicted again as a felon in possession of a firearm (which carries severe penalties). If you are a felon, you are not even allowed to be in the same room as a person with a gun, let alone purchase one and lie on the form when you do it.\n\nTo be clear, I understand the circumstances surrounding the creation of the crack laws of the 1980s and the 1994 Crime Bill. I am from the inner city, and I am old enough to remember the tail end of the crack epidemic. The issue is not the creation of a Crime Bill. The issue is that the finished product went too far. There are a trail of shattered homes and broken families as a result of convictions for some of the crimes that Hunter was just absolved of.\n\nWhere is their pardon?\n\nThe President could have pardoned anyone charged with the same charges his son was just freed of consequence from. It would have been a legacy shaping moment and a step toward fixing the mess that Biden created. Instead, he gave the proverbial middle finger to all of the people that were harmed by laws that he wrote by freeing his son from the consequences of them.\n\nDarvio Morrow is CEO of The FCB Radio Network and co-host of The Outlaws Radio Show.\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nDemocrats are not yet ready to unify behind Hillary Clinton. Last week, Bill Clinton got into a row with activists from Black Lives Matter over his 1994 Crime Bill.\n\nWith criminal justice reform regarded as an urgent priority, that 1994 measure is being held up in Democratic circles as a reason to view the Clintons with suspicion.\n\nBack in 1994, it was popular to be \"tough on crime,\" so that's where the Clintons positioned themselves. They were not alone. Democratic leaders in the Congress, such as Joe Biden and Charles Schumer, spearheaded the effort to get an anti-crime bill enacted.\n\nAs the months passed, the original bill started to snowball into a gigantic omnibus measure. Members of Congress angled to attach their pet projects to the bill because they knew that when the whole package came up for a vote, most everyone would go along even if they did not support everything in it.\n\nBy the end of the process, the bill was a monstrosity of pork barrel politics. Time 's political columnist Joe Klein dubbed the 1994 Crime Bill a \"garbage barge.\"\n\nThe Crime Bill maddens today's BLM activists because it earmarked $7.9 billion in grants to the states for the building of prisons. To be eligible for the funds, states had to meet certain conditions. The idea was to encourage the states to embrace the stricter policies found in the federal system, which had abolished parole and limited good time credits for prisoners, which allow well behaved inmates to earn an earlier release date.\n\nMany states were eager to do just that. During the 1990s, America was building a new prison every week, on average. And as soon as those facilities opened up, they were soon operating beyond their original design capacity.\n\nMany of the prisoners were young minority men, nonviolent drug offenders who were serving mandatory minimum sentences.\n\nBy 2000, there was growing concern about the enormity of America's prison system. Today there is angst all across the political spectrum over \"mass incarceration.\"\n\nThousands and thousands of minority men have been locked up. And when they get released, as most prisoners will be, their criminal record makes it very difficult to secure a job and join the mainstream economy.\n\nMore and more people are coming to realize that the so-called \"war on drugs\" has not stopped people from using drugs. What it has done is wreak havoc on Black America .\n\nTo their credit, many progressives admit that the lock' em up policies that are responsible for today's mass incarceration were supported by both Republicans and Democrats.\n\nWriting in the February edition of The Nation , Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow , says, \"Bill Clinton presided over the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history.... When Clinton left office in 2001, the United States had the highest rate of incarceration in the world.\"\n\nIt should be noted that libertarians have been sounding the alarm about such trends for many, many years. A 1994 Cato Institute study titled Prison Blues said that over the preceding 15 years, \"American elected officials have required prisons to engage in a bold social experiment. The historical prison policy-incarceration of violent criminals-has been replaced with a policy of using prisons mainly to punish drug offenders with increasingly severe, mandatory terms in increasingly overcrowded prisons.\"\n\nCato's Handbook for Congress in 1995 urged lawmakers to call off the drug war and to repeal the Clinton Crime Bill.\n\nTragically, members of Congress were bent on escalating its drug war policies. Only now, 20 years later, are policymakers coming around to the idea of sentencing reform and how to disentangle themselves from failed drug war policies .\n\nThe Clintons have known for some time that they've been out of sync with their political base on matters pertaining to criminal justice. Last year, Bill admitted that his prison-building policies \"overshot the mark\" and that there are \"too many people in prison for too long.\"\n\nHillary has tried to sound like a reformer, saying, \"We need a true national debate about how to reduce our prison population while keeping our communities safe.\"\n\nSuch throwaway lines are not nearly enough for BLM activists. For them (and others too), support for the 1994 Crime Bill is the political equivalent of Hillary's vote to support the Iraq war: It was a key indicator of policy judgment-and the Clintons failed the test.\n\nTim Lynch is director of the Cato Institute's Project on Criminal Justice.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nNow that health-care reform is the president's bill, congressional Democrats inclined to oppose it will have to go to the Oval Office and look President Obama in the eye when they make their case. That's a lot tougher than begging off in Nancy Pelosi's or Harry Reid's office. We finally have Obama where we want him, which is taking the leadership reins to push health-care reform across the finish line. Passing it may be tough politically, but it could turn out, like the 1994 crime bill, to be a long-term success.\n\nSucceeding on the core issue of his first year is central to Obama's political success, but for Democrats sitting in shaky seats, voting for legislation that half the country doesn't want feels like walking the plank. The country is disappointed that Obama hasn't done more to bring the change he promised, but the real focus of voter anger is Congress and the odious preening and dealmaking that have become front and center in the legislative process.\n\nAsking Congress to go against public opinion is perilous, says Bill Schneider, a public-opinion expert at Third Way, the centrist Democratic think tank. Schneider adds that the risk is compounded by reconciliation , a maneuver to allow parts of the legislation to prevail with 51 votes. \"There will be a firestorm if it passes,\" he says. Democrats are bracing for that, but most have concluded that no bill is a worse outcome, and that they have until November to turn around public opinion by focusing on aspects of the legislation that people favor, like popular insurance reforms or closing the doughnut hole for seniors in their prescription-drug coverage.\n\nIt is a winnable argument, but maybe not in time to save vulnerable Democrats in the November midterms. The closest analogy to what Democrats face with health-care reform is the crime bill . It was a short-term disaster for Democrats, contributing to their loss of congressional majorities in the House and Senate, but it came to be seen as a major success and was credited with bringing down crime rates. Crime was the hot-button cultural issue at the time, invoked by Republicans to paint Democrats as weak.\n\nThe bill expanded the federal death penalty to dozens more crimes, funded more prison construction, and promised 100,000 more cops on the street , President Clinton's signature proposal. It passed the House handily (285 to 141) and was joined in an omnibus crime bill with other more controversial legislation, notably a ban on assault weapons, which survived by a single vote in the House when a Democrat from Indiana switched from no to yes. Jim Kessler, a policy analyst at Third Way, worked on the bill as an aide to New York Rep. Chuck Schumer (now a senator), who was the principal sponsor in the House. He says the 100,000 cops were popular; the assault weapons ban controversial but necessary; the weak link in the chain was money for youth sports leagues, which Rush Limbaugh dubbed \"midnight basketball.\"\n\nOpening community centers on weekend nights to get kids off the streets was emblematic of the crime-prevention programs in the bill, and it was enough for Republicans to ridicule the $30 billion bill as out-of-control Washington, liberal do-gooder spending. With crack wars getting headlines, voters were poised to punish politicians who were soft on crime.\n\nDemocrats were able to pass the bill, and when members went home to their districts for the August recess, only then did they realize how much trouble they were in with the voters. The legislation would prove a liability in November as Democrats lost the Congress, but very quickly crime rates dropped and Democrats claimed the legislation as a major achievement. Clinton still talks about 100,000 cops on the street, and Vice President Joe Biden on the campaign trail in 2008 hailed the Violence Against Women Act , which was part of the 1994 crime bill, and which he sponsored. Thanks to the crime bill's success, Democrats eliminated the political liability that fear of crime had saddled them with since the 1960s.\n\nWhen the furor over \"death panels\" erupted last summer, Kessler saw it as the \"midnight basketball-ization\" of major legislation-where Republicans find something that is emblematic of liberal ideology or Congress out of control, and then pound away until they potentially bring down the entire edifice. This time the danger warning arrived much earlier, with the loss of Ted Kennedy's Senate seat. Democrats, with Obama taking the lead, have time to save themselves and their majority by simply doing their jobs and passing a health-care bill. \"If we can improve health care the way we improved crime rates, it would be a miracle,\" says Kessler. Conservatives joke that Obama was born in a manger, but even miracles take time.\n\nEleanor Clift is the author of Two Weeks of Life: A Memoir of Love, Death, and Politics and Founding Sisters and the Nineteenth Amendment .\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nSpeaking in Philadelphia on Thursday, former President Bill Clinton defended his 1994 crime bill, which brought increases in death penalty use, the lengths of sentences and the size of the prison population.\n\nClinton's remarks represented a break with his wife's positions on criminal justice. In recent months, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has argued that the \"tough on crime\" policies of her husband's administration were often too tough and had a disproportionate effect on blacks and Latinos.\n\nCriminal justice reform has become an increasingly important element recently in the race for the White House, with both Democrats and Republicans calling for reforms. But the former president, challenged on his criminal justice record by protesters from the Black Lives Matter movement, stood firm Thursday. \"Because of that bill, we had a 25-year low in crime,\" he said.\n\nHe also appeared to defend his spouse's now-infamous comments about \"super-predators\"-children whom Hillary Clinton described, in a 1996 speech, as having \"no conscience\" and \"no empathy.\" Her remarks were criticized by some activists, who said the concept of \"super predators\" was a fiction used to advance unjust, racially discriminatory criminal justice legislation like the 1994 crime bill, which was championed by then-Senator Joe Biden, virtually all Democrats in Congress and then-Representative Bernie Sanders. Hillary Clinton later apologized for the remarks, but protesters have not let her, or her husband, forget.\n\nDuring his speech Thursday, one protester held a sign that said, \"Hillary Is a Murderer!\" Another heckled the former president. In response, Clinton seemed to suggest that some of those his crime bill put behind bars belonged there-and that his wife agreed with him. \"I don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out onto the street to murder other African-American children. Maybe you thought they were good citizens. She didn't.\"\n\nHe added, \"You are defending the people who killed the lives you say matter.\"\n\nBut Clinton also sought to put some distance between his wife's record and his own, telling the crowd that his wife, who didn't hold elected office when he was president, didn't vote for the bill and that she lobbied for more lenient sentences for nonviolent offenders.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nSteve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, South Carolina, and a campaign surrogate for New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, previewed several lines of attack against Bloomberg's competitors at a press conference Tuesday afternoon.\n\nSpeaking alongside other surrogates to promote Bloomberg's appearance ahead of the Democratic Party's 10th primary debate in Charleston, Benjamin said that \"Bernie Sanders voted for the [1990s] crime bill\" and that \"Joe Biden co-authored the crime bill.\"\n\n\"The crime bill, along with several other votes in the 80s, ushered in this period of mass incarceration,\" Benjamin said at the Belmond Charleston Place.\n\nThe bill he was referring to, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, was get-tough-on-crime umbrella legislation that aimed to crack down on gangs, among other provisions.\n\nIn recent months, Bloomberg had faced heightened scrutiny for overseeing a policy of stop-and-frisk during his tenure as New York's mayor. Critics contend that Bloomberg misunderstands the impact this policy had on the city's black and brown residents and has insufficiently atoned for its harms.\n\nBenjamin also said during the press conference that it was important to nominate a candidate who has been \"fully vetted\" by the public.\n\nBloomberg's defenders have sought to recast the conversation about his campaign as one of electability, increasingly highlighting his desire to take on President Donald Trump in a head-to-head match-up.\n\nThe state's presidential primary is on Saturday.\n\nAs a member of Congress in the 1990s, Sanders did vote for the 1994 crime bill, and Joe Biden, then a U.S. senator, helped to author it.\n\nSanders explained his vote at the time as one emerging from a place of compromise, especially considering provisions in the bill that related to other, pressing policy issues.\n\n\"I have a number of serious problems with the crime bill, but one part of it that I vigorously support is the Violence Against Women Act,\" Sanders said on the floor of the House of Representatives in 1994. \"We urgently need the $1.8 billion in this bill to combat the epidemic of violence against women on the streets and in the homes of America.\"\n\nThe federal assault weapons ban that existed from 1994 to 2004 was also enacted as part of this legislation. Sanders had earlier voted against a 1991 crime bill.\n\nWhile Biden's record leans more punitive, he did object to some of the harsher proposals being considered during the crafting of the 1994 bill, including efforts to make repeated non-violent felonies subject to the severe three-strikes rule.\n\nExperts say the 1994 crime bill in and of itself did not cause mass incarceration to accelerate. According to data collected by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the incarceration rate for black Americans rose by around 50 percent from 1985 to 1990. It rose by a little less than that from 1990 to 1995. And for the five years succeeding the bill's enactment, incarceration rates for black Americans barely budged upward, representing a substantial deceleration.\n\nThough the bill toughened penalties for federal offenses, the vast majority of U.S. prisoners are convicted under state prosecutions, limiting the reach of the federal legislation. The bill did incentivize states to strengthen their own criminal codes. However, the impact of this provision was limited, research suggests.\n\nPolling at the time also indicates the public was specifically concerned about the prevalence of crime. In a Gallup survey from January 1994, 37 percent of Americans said that crime was \"the most important problem facing the country,\" a higher share than on any other issue surveyed.\n\nAsher Stockler is a reporter for Newsweek covering the National Rifle Association and gun policy.\n\nAsher Stockler is a reporter for Newsweek covering the National Rifle Association and gun policy.\n\nAsher Stockler is a reporter for Newsweek covering the National Rifle Association and gun policy.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

It was mass incarceration for Black people, many of them innocent,\" the president tweeted. \"I did Criminal Justice Reform, something Obama & Biden didn't even try to do - & couldn't do even if they did try. Biden can never escape his Crime Bill!\"\n\nUnder the terms of the 1994 Crime Bill backed by Biden, more resources were diverted to prisons as sentences for drug offenses became harsher. The bill also contained the \"three strikes\" rule that saw life sentences without parole handed down to people convicted of at least three violent felonies or drug trafficking offenses.\n\nIn December 2018, President Trump signed the bipartisan First Step Act into law, reducing the mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes while allowing more federal prisoners to earn early release.\n\n\"This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community,\" Trump said of the First Step Act in his State of the Union address last year.\n\nHowever, the president's effort to reform federal crime law disproportionately impacting the black community does not appear to have had much cut through with Americans amid protests against the killing of an unarmed black man in Minneapolis Police custody last week.\n\nA poll published by CBS News on Wednesday found that 58 percent of U.S. adults disapproved of the president's handling of race relations following his repeated threats to deploy military personnel at the ongoing protests against police brutality.\n\nOnly a third of Americans said they approved of the president's record on race relations, while a further 9 percent told pollsters they didn't know where they stood on the matter.\n\nAsked whether they thought race relations in the U.S. were generally good or bad at the moment, 61 percent said race relations were in a bad place.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nDespite billing themselves as the best bet voters have for criminal justice reform, neither former Vice President Joe Biden nor President Donald Trump has a strong record to fall back on.\n\nThe Republican National Convention kicked off on Monday with Senator Tim Scott and Georgia state Representative Vernon Jones, a Democrat, lauding Trump for the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform bill the president signed in 2018. Trump-who pardoned on Tuesday night Jon Ponder, a former bank robber who started a nonprofit in 2010 to help formerly incarcerated individuals-and other speakers contrasted that accomplishment with Biden's involvement in tough-on-crime legislation.\n\n\"Don't forget. It was us, us together, that got criminal justice reform done,\" Trump said on Monday. \"The greatest thing for the Black community, [the] African American community. They came and they said, 'We can't believe it. Obama didn't even try.'\"\n\nA bipartisan bill, the First Step Act resulted in the release of 3,100 people from prison in July 2019 as part of the act's \"good time credit fix,\" and an additional 3,000 people were resentenced to shorter prison terms, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. It's an aspect of the Trump administration's legacy that some experts say should be praised, but it's all Trump has to point to in terms of criminal justice reform legislation.\n\n\"Yes, he signed and supported an important piece of legislation, but that seems to be where the story ends,\" Kara Gotsch, director of strategic initiatives at the Sentencing Project, told Newsweek . \"I think a lot of people in my community, after the commutation of Alice Johnson, hoped that it would lead to significant numbers of commutations.\"\n\nTrump granted Johnson clemency in June 2018 after she served 21 years in prison for a first-time nonviolent drug offense. Two years later, he commuted the sentences of Crystal Munoz, Tynice Hall and Judith Negron, three women who served prison time with Johnson, and on Thursday, she's expected to speak at the GOP convention.\n\nFor all the lambasting of Biden's criminal justice record and praise of the First Step Act, Trump's also taken a hard stance in favor of law enforcement, labeled protesters \"anarchists\" and characterized himself as a \"law and order\" president. Trump also pushed for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, a group of young men wrongly convicted of a 1989 murder. He supported the same punishment for drug dealers just three months after signing the First Step Act, making it unclear where he truly stands on criminal justice reform.\n\n\"I'm not confident Trump will stay consistent,\" Ediberto Román, a law professor at Florida International University, said. \"Time will only tell, but he seems to support it when it serves his interest.\"\n\nTrump's sending \"mixed signals\" to different audiences with regard to criminal justice reform, according to Rachel Barkow, author of Prisoners of Politics: Breaking the Cycle of Mass Incarceration . While Biden isn't her \"dream candidate,\" he's the \"more promising\" option, in her opinion, because both his and vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris' recent actions indicate they'll be supportive of such reform.\n\nHarris' \"trajectory is going in the right direction, and Biden at least is claiming that he is going to support more criminal justice reform efforts,\" Barkow said.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Biden sponsored and supported laws that created mandatory minimum sentences for certain drug-related crimes and increased funding for states to build prisons. Two laws, the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act and the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, have gotten the bulk of the attention for the disproportionate impacts on the African American community.\n\nIn June, he told Charlamagne Tha God, host of the Breakfast Club radio show, that the goal of legislation he sponsored was to ensure people wouldn't be given a harsher sentence because of the color of their skin. However, an \"unintended consequence\" of some of his legislation was that judges were bound by the punishment requirements for the crime and could not lower sentences.\n\nBiden has called his role in passing tough-on-crime legislation a \"big mistake,\" and in June he said concerns about the 1994 crime bill were \"legitimate\" during a virtual NAACP forum. But he said people should base their opinion on his current actions and comments. Biden's plan if elected includes increased rehabilitation for formerly incarcerated people, creating a $20 billion grant program for states that eliminate mandatory minimums for nonviolent crimes, decriminalizing the use of marijuana and eliminating sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine.\n\nWhereas Biden said his changing stance was due to evolving ideas, Gotsch said the driving force behind criminal justice reform in the White House isn't the president but his son-in-law, senior adviser Jared Kushner. During the keynote address at the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center's Second Step Presidential Justice Forum last October, Trump said Kushner worked \"tirelessly\" to get the First Step Act passed. Kushner was so persistent that the president said he agreed to support the measure.\n\n\"I don't think Jared Kushner is enough to get done what needs to get done,\" Gotsch said. \"If someone doesn't believe in it personally and understands why it's so important, I don't see how we get so much farther than where we are right now. Of course, I could be wrong; no one can read the future.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to the White House and Biden's campaign for comments but did not hear back in time for publication.\n\nWith two candidates who have records that have brought them both praise and criticism, all three experts said that when it comes to the election, it's important to consider what the future will hold. Even though Harris was criticized for actions she took as a prosecutor and California's attorney general, Gotsch said her record as a senator makes her one of criminal justice reforms \"biggest champions.\" If she continues down that path, \"it'll be a good thing for future reform.\"\n\nBarkow said she hopes if Biden wins, he appoints a new crop of U.S. attorneys and that people who are appointed to sentencing commissions and federal judgeships are from the public defense and civil liberties sector, because bringing that side of the system into the fold is likely to result in better criminal justice reform.\n\nWhether Trump and Biden will meet in a debate is still up in the air, but Román said that on the issue of criminal justice reform, the results would likely be a \"wash\" if based on the candidates' merits. Whom voters see as the better candidate will likely come down to how the messaging is packaged, he said. Biden could point to the Violence Against Women Act (legislation enacted as part of the overall 1994 crime bill) that classified domestic violence and sexual assault as crimes. But in a 30-second sound bite about the past, Román said, Trump might have an \"easier time on this one.\"\n\nAlthough she is confident Biden would be more in favor of criminal justice reform than Trump, Barkow said if Biden doesn't take responsibility for the mistakes he's made in the past and commit to using his clemency powers, it will show there were \"no lessons learned.\"\n\nJenni Fink is a senior editor at Newsweek, based in New York.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nTo formerly incarcerated felons like me in the Black community, Trump's mug shot made him relatable. His multiple indictments made him worthy of sympathy. But his felony conviction on 34 counts makes him one of us-literally.\n\nI used to be a Black Robin Hood. In the '80s and '90s, I stole from white-owned banks to fund political and cultural events designed to educate the Black community in the inner city of Baltimore. Though I was a first-time offender when I was caught and no one was hurt during any of my crimes, thanks to Joe Biden 's 1994 crime bill, I got an unheard of 52 years in prison. And thanks to Donald Trump 's 2019 First Step Act, I was released from prison. Now, the same criminal justice system that was weaponized against me and other Black Americans-a justice system that Trump reformed-is being used to keep Trump from winning the presidency for a second time.\n\nLast Thursday, former President Donald Trump was found guilty of accounting entries that constituted falsifying documents in order to influence the 2016 election. This is the first time a former president and current presidential candidate has ever been convicted of a felony. If he defeats Biden, he'll be the very first sitting president to be a convicted felon. This will be an unbelievable first.\n\nBut we in the African-American community have seen leaders receive felony convictions or imprisonment due to their political beliefs, affiliations, and actions all our lives. We've seen Black activists, politicians, and public figures investigated, tried, and convicted far too many times-Martin and Malcolm were just the most notable.\n\nThis tactic is now being used on Trump-invoking the legal system to punish unpopular political beliefs and actions. But it isn't new to Black Americans, and it certainly isn't new to me.\n\nLike many Black political activists, I know too well the difference between being prosecuted for committing a crime and being persecuted for advocating a political agenda that doesn't have a place in the mainstream.\n\nI know too well what Trump felt when people he thought were his friends and allies turned out to be informers and agents working against him. I know it well and so do too many people in my community. We know the sting and heartbreak Trump must have felt listening to Michael Cohen take the stand and testify; for me, it was like reliving my own trial again. Cohen, like the informant in my case, was a thief and liar without any credibility-until, of course, he decided to turn state's witness. Then suddenly everything he said was treated as the Gods' honest truth.\n\nI lived that!\n\nJudge Merchan's jury instructions seemed to me to make it clear to the judge that their job was to convict, regardless of the evidence and law. Like many Black Americans, I've heard similar instructions which were similarly weighted against myself and my people.\n\nBlack leaders and Black citizens know the difference between a criminal prosecution and a political persecution. Now, Donald Trump knows the difference as well. His America First agenda is considered radical, violent, and bigoted by the elite. He is viewed today in the same light as past Black leaders and activists-radical, violent, and bigoted.\n\nIn the past, white Americans turned a blind eye to the unconstitutional weaponization of law enforcement and the judicial system against Black political, social, and public leaders who ran afoul of the power structure. White America said nothing when the criminal justice system was weaponized against Black Americans for selling and using drugs and guns that were dumped into our communities by the government. It didn't matter to the broader American electorate that the 1994 crime bill was based on the unconstitutional concept of \"crime control\" instead of due process.\n\nBut now that same \"crime control\" approach is being unleashed on the America First movement and its leader, Donald Trump.\n\nI hope that all Americans learn the lesson Trump's conviction teaches, a lesson that was taught by the late James Baldwin when he said in a letter to Angela Davis: \"If they take you in the morning, they will be coming for us at night.\"\n\nBlack Americans were the first victims of a weaponized justice system.

      "text": "Biden Tries To Gloss Over His Long History of Supporting the Drug War and Draconian Criminal Penalties\n\nJoe Biden\n\nJacob Sullum | 10.16.2020 1:45 PM\n\nDuring his ABC \" town hall \" last night, responding to a question from moderator George Stephanopoulos, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden agreed that it was a \"mistake\" to \"support\" the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. At the same time, he defended parts of the law, including the Violence Against Women Act, funding to support \"community policing\" by hiring more officers, and the now-expired federal ban on \"assault weapons.\" He also implied that the real problem was not so much the law itself but the way that states responded to it. \"The mistake came in terms of what the states did locally,\" he said.\n\nBoth the question and the answer were highly misleading. First, Biden did not merely \"support\" the 1994 law; he wrote the damned thing, which he has proudly called \"the 1994 Biden Crime Bill.\" Second, as much as Biden might like to disavow the law's penalty enhancements now that public opinion on criminal justice has shifted, he was proud of them at the time. Third, the 1994 crime bill is just one piece of legislation in Biden's long history of supporting mindlessly punitive responses to drugs and crime.\n\nBiden is trying to gloss over a major theme of his political career. \"Every major crime bill since 1976 that's come out of this Congress-every minor crime bill-has had the name of the Democratic senator from Delaware, Joe Biden,\" he bragged in 1993. Now he wants us to believe his agenda was limited to domestic violence, community policing, and gun control.\n\n\"Things have changed drastically\" since 1994, Biden said last night, noting that \"the Black Caucus voted\" for the crime bill, and \"every black mayor supported it.\" In other words, now that black politicians and Democrats generally have rejected the idea that criminal penalties can never be too severe, Biden has shifted with the winds of opinion. But as Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) noted during a Democratic presidential debate last year, that does not mean we should forget Biden's leading role in the disastrous war on drugs and the draconian criminal justice policies that put more and more people in cages for longer and longer periods of time.\n\n\"The crime bill itself did not have mandatory sentences except for two things,\" Biden said. He mentioned the law's \"three strikes and you're out\" provision, which required a life sentence for anyone convicted of a violent crime after committing two other felonies, one of which can be a drug offense. He said he \"voted against\" that provision, which is not exactly true. While he did express concern that the provision was not focused narrowly enough on serious violent crimes, he voted for it as part of the broader bill.\n\nIn any case, Biden did not just go along with the crime bill's punitive provisions; he crowed about them. Like a crass car salesman hawking a new model with more of everything, he touted \"70 additional enhancements of penalties\" and \"60 new death penalties-brand new-60.\" He denounced as \"poppycock\" the notion, which would later be defensively deployed by Bill Clinton and Biden himself , that \"somehow the Republicans tried to make the crime bill tougher.\" Biden bragged that he had conferred with \"the cops\" instead of some namby-pamby \"liberal confab\" while writing the bill.\n\nAs for \"what the states did locally,\" the law was designed to increase incarceration. It provided $10 billion in subsidies for state prison construction, contingent on passage of \"truth in sentencing\" laws that limited or abolished parole. \"What I was against was giving states more money for prison systems,\" Biden said last night. But that is simply not true. As FactCheck.org noted last year, \"Biden did support $6 billion in funding for state prison construction, but not the $10 billion that was part of the final bill.\"\n\nDespite Biden's implication that he was not a fan of mandatory minimums, he zealously supported them in previous legislation, including the Anti-Drug Abuse Acts of 1986 and 1988. The latter law included a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for anyone caught with five grams of crack cocaine, whether or not he was involved in distribution.\n\nAs Biden explained it on the Senate floor in 1991 while holding up a quarter, \"we said crack cocaine is such a bad deal that if you find someone with this much of it-a quarter's worth, not in value, but in size-five years in jail.\" To be clear: Biden was not marveling at the blatant injustice of that punishment. He was touting his anti-drug bona fides.\n\nBiden also supported a sentencing policy that treated crack cocaine as if it were 100 times worse than cocaine powder, even though these are simply two different ways of consuming the same drug. Under the 1986 law, possessing five grams of crack with intent to distribute it triggered the same five-year mandatory minimum sentence as 500 grams of cocaine powder; likewise, the 10-year mandatory minimum required five kilograms of cocaine powder but only 50 grams of crack.\n\nBecause federal crack offenders were overwhelmingly black, while cocaine powder offenders were more likely to be white or Hispanic, the rule Biden supported meant that darker-skinned defendants received substantially heavier penalties than lighter-skinned defendants for essentially the same offenses. \"We may not have gotten it right,\" Biden conceded 16 years after he helped establish the 100-to-1 rule. Five years later, during an unsuccessful bid for his party's 2008 presidential nomination, he introduced a bill that would have equalized crack and cocaine powder sentences.\n\nThe distinction between smoked and snorted cocaine \"was a big mistake when it was made,\" Biden admitted in a speech he gave just before entering the presidential race in 2019, nine years after Congress approved a law that shrank but did not eliminate the sentencing gap. \"We thought we were told by the experts that crack...was somehow fundamentally different. It's not different.\" The misconception, he added, \"trapped an entire generation.\"\n\nThese are just a few examples of Biden's enthusiasm for coming down hard on people who dare to defy the government's arbitrary pharmacological decrees. You can read more about that here .\n\nNowadays, Biden opposes the mandatory minimums and death penalties he championed for decades. But his current position still reflects his commitment to using force against people engaged in peaceful conduct that violates no one's rights.\n\n\"I don't believe anybody should be going to jail for drug use,\" Biden said last night. \"They should be going into mandatory rehabilitation. We should be building rehab centers to have these people housed.\"\n\nWhile Biden considers that approach enlightened and humane, there is no moral justification for foisting \"treatment\" on people who do not want it and may not even be addicted. That policy strips people of their liberty, dignity, and moral agency simply because they consume psychoactive substances that politicians do not like. Biden, who in the late 1980s was saying \"we have to hold every drug user accountable,\" now wants to lock drug users in \"rehab centers\" rather than prisons. If that looks like an improvement, it is only because Biden's prior record is so appalling.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Trump's Anti-Crime Agenda Contradicts His Criticism of Biden's Legislative Record\n\nDonald Trump\n\nJacob Sullum | 5.23.2024 7:10 PM\n\nDuring his 2020 presidential campaign, Donald Trump attacked Joe Biden from the left on drug policy and criminal justice, slamming him for pushing harsh laws that had disproportionately hurt black people. Trump is trying that same tack again this time around, portraying Biden as a racist eager to lock up African Americans. \"We must not forget that it was Joe Biden who was a key figure in passing the 1994 Crime Bill, which disproportionately harmed Black communities through harsh sentencing laws and increased incarceration rates,\" Janiyah Thomas, the Trump campaign's \"black media director,\" said in an emailed press release on Thursday.\n\nThat stance is consistent with aspects of Trump's record as president, including his support for the FIRST STEP Act , a package of sentencing and prison reforms that he signed into law in December 2018. But it is blatantly inconsistent with Trump's current drug policy and criminal justice agenda, which favors aggressive enforcement, severe penalties, and impunity for abusive police officers.\n\nLike Biden, who in 2022 promised to \"beat the opioid epidemic\" by \"stop[ping] the flow of illicit drugs,\" Trump indulges in the familiar fantasy that interdiction can prevent Americans from consuming politically disfavored intoxicants. But Trump goes bigger, imagining \"a full naval embargo on the drug cartels\" and deployment of \"military assets\" to \"inflict maximum damage\" on them. If the U.S. does not get \"the full cooperation of other governments to stop this menace,\" he warns , \"we will expose every bribe, every kickback, every payoff, and every bit of corruption that is allowing the cartels to preserve their brutal reign.\"\n\nTrump's insistence that he is a tougher drug warrior than Biden is hard to reconcile with his portrayal of Biden as an overzealous drug warrior who was heedless of the damage his legislation did. And Trump does not offer much evidence from his own record as president that determination and violence can defeat the economics of prohibition. \"For three decades before my election,\" he says , \"drug overdose deaths increased every single year. We took the drug and fentanyl crisis head on, and we achieved the first reduction in overdose deaths in more than 30 years.\"\n\nTrump is referring to a slight decrease in drug-related deaths between 2017 and 2018. He neglects to mention that the number went back up again in 2019 and 2020, reaching record levels during his administration-a trend that continued after he left office. Contrary to Trump's spin, the 1.7 percent drop in opioid-related deaths he highlights does not suggest his ideas for \"Ending the Scourge of Drug Addiction in America\" are any better than Biden's.\n\nIn addition to deploying America's military might against drug cartels, Trump promises to \"take down the gangs\" that \"distribute these deadly narcotics on a local level.\" That will entail a lot of arrests and a lot of prison sentences, producing the \"increased incarceration rates\" that Trump decries. Just as the policies that Biden supported as a senator \"disproportionately harmed Black communities,\" so will the crackdown that Trump has in mind.\n\nTrump says he also will \"ask Congress to ensure that drug dealers, kingpins and human traffickers receive the death penalty.\" Executing drug dealers is not a new idea for Trump, who has repeatedly recommended that policy over the years. But it is inconsistent with with his criticism of Biden's legislative record, his condemnation of \"very unfair\" drug penalties, his commutations for nonviolent drug offenders who had received those penalties, and his support for sentencing reform.\n\nThe most famous beneficiary of Trump's clemency was Alice Johnson , a first-time offender who had received a life sentence for participating in a Memphis cocaine trafficking operation. \"You have many people like Mrs. Johnson,\" Trump told Fox News in 2018. \"There are people in jail for really long terms.\" Trump highlighted Johnson's case during his 2019 State of the Union address , in a 2020 Super Bowl ad , and at the 2020 Republican National Convention , where Johnson gave a grateful speech.\n\nAs a black woman hit with a draconian sentence under inflexible drug laws, Johnson was a useful exhibit in Trump's case that African-American voters should be grateful to him and wary of Biden. But after Trump re-upped his death penalty proposal in a 2023 interview with Fox News, his mercy collided with his blood lust.\n\nWhen Bret Baier pointed out that someone like Johnson would have been \"killed under your plan,\" Trump was flummoxed. \"No, no, no,\" he said. \"It would depend on the severity,\" he added. He also noted that the death penalty he imagined would not apply retroactively to Johnson herself and suggested that, had it been the law at the time, it would have deterred her from getting involved in drug dealing.\n\nBy that point, Trump had become disenchanted with sentencing reform. In a 2022 interview with New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman, he bitterly complained that he had not reaped the political reward he expected from backing the FIRST STEP Act. \"Did it for African Americans,\" he told her. \"Nobody else could have gotten it done. Got zero credit.\"\n\nDespite that disappointing experience, Trump is trying again, and his drug war enthusiasm is not the only reason to be skeptical of his pitch. His anti-crime agenda , which reflects his authoritarian instincts , includes a promise to \"strengthen qualified immunity and other protections for police officers.\"\n\nAs critics across the political spectrum have been pointing out for years, the doctrine of qualified immunity , which bars federal civil rights claims unless they allege violations of \"clearly established\" law, often shields police officers (and other government officials ) from liability for outrageous misconduct . But as Trump sees it, that shield is not big and strong enough.\n\nTrump has promised to \"indemnify\" cops \"against any and all liability.\" He apparently does not realize that police officers already are routinely indemnified in the rare cases when they are held liable for abuse, and he implausibly argues that the threat of liability has a paralyzing impact, discouraging cops from doing their jobs. In case beefing up qualified immunity does not do the trick, Trump also promises to give police \"immunity from prosecution\" for violating people's rights.\n\nTrump thinks total impunity for abusive cops is necessary to \"reclaim safety, dignity, and peace for law-abiding Americans.\" In his view, remedies for police abuse, such as insisting that officers obey the Constitution or authorizing criminal charges and civil rights lawsuits when they don't, are dangerous to public order. He believes police officers should not have to worry that they could face charges or litigation simply because they broke the law, and maybe a few heads, while doing their jobs.\n\nGiven that position, Trump may have a hard time persuading black voters that he is on their side. As Reason 's Billy Binion notes , survey data suggest those voters want the law and order that Trump promises, but not at the cost of giving free rein to armed agents of the state.\n\nTrump's positions on drug policy and criminal justice are utterly incoherent. Mass incarceration is bad, he says, even as he recommends policies that would imprison more people for conduct that violates no one's rights. Drug laws that disproportionately hurt African Americans are troubling, he thinks, but they should be enforced more aggressively. A life sentence for Alice Johnson was plainly unjust, he says, but a death sentence would have been appropriate. Biden was mindlessly punitive, he argues, but Trump is preferable because he is even tougher. Trump cannot logically have it both ways, but that will not stop him from trying.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Bill Clinton: Tough on Crime, Easy on Himself\n\nBill Clinton\n\nJacob Sullum | From the July 2016 issue\n\nBill Clinton wants you to know three things about the 1994 crime bill: He is proud of it, he is sorry about it, and it wasn't his fault. In any case, he says, his wife had nothing to do with it.\n\nThe former president's position on the 22-year-old Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act is newly relevant now that Hillary Clinton, who enthusiastically supported the bill as first lady, is running for president as a criminal justice reformer. Depending on your sympathies, her husband's take is either nuanced or incoherent.\n\nSpeaking in Philadelphia on April 7, Bill Clinton was repeatedly interrupted by Black Lives Matter protesters who blame him for contributing to the \"mass incarceration\" he and his wife now decry. He defended the crime bill as an appropriate response to violence that disproportionately hurt African Americans.\n\n\"Because of that bill,\" Clinton said, \"we had a 25-year low in crime [and] a 33-year low in the murder rate.\" While it's true that violent crime began a long decline in the early 1990s, crime rates started falling before the 1994 bill took effect, and there is little evidence that the elements of the bill Clinton touts played an important role in the continuation of that downward trend.\n\nClinton bragged, for example, about providing $10 billion in grants that helped put 100,000 or so additional police officers on the streets. In 2014 Washington Post fact checker Glenn Kessler gave Clinton's claims about that program's impact \"three Pinocchios,\" saying it \"was not the primary or even secondary factor in the dramatic reduction in crime during the 1990s.\"\n\nWhat about the crime bill's ban on so-called assault weapons, which expired in 2004? That year a report commissioned by the Justice Department concluded that \"we cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation's recent drop in gun violence.\"\n\nClinton also mentioned the 1993 Brady Bill, which required background checks for people who buy firearms from federally licensed dealers. According to research by Duke University criminologist Philip Cook, a gun control supporter, that requirement \"made no discernible difference\" in firearm homicide rates.\n\nClinton did not cite incarceration as a factor in falling crime, because he was bending over backward to distance himself from that aspect of the 1994 bill. He said the bill's punitive provisions, which included new mandatory minimum sentences and subsidies for state prison construction that were contingent on passage of \"truth in sentencing\" laws (which limit or abolish parole), were forced on him by Republicans.\n\nAccording to Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden, then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the crime bill's main sponsor, told him, \"You can't pass this bill, and the Republicans will kill it, if you don't put more sentencing in.\" Yet as first lady, Hillary Clinton cited tougher sentencing rules as one of the bill's main advantages, and after it passed the administration bragged about making prison terms longer.\n\nIt seems likely that increased imprisonment did help reduce crime, if only by incapacitating people inclined to commit it. But the effectiveness of that policy depends on locking up the right people for the right amount of time, and Clinton now concedes the sentences he supported as president went too far.\n\n\"I signed a bill that made the problem worse, and I want to admit it,\" he said during another visit to Philadelphia in 2015. \"In that bill, there were longer sentences, and most of these people are in prison under state law, but the federal law set a trend. And that was overdone; we were wrong about that.\"\n\nClinton was in a less apologetic mood this April. Perhaps he was tired of overheated criticism that exaggerates his role in the explosive growth of the U.S. prison population, a trend that began a decade before he took office and occurred mainly at the state level. But if Clinton wants less blame, he should stop taking so much credit.\n\nThis article originally appeared in print under the headline \"Bill Clinton: Tough on Crime, Easy on Himself.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "The 1994 Crime Bill Was A Liberal Policy\n\nEd Krayewski | 4.8.2016 12:11 PM\n\nBill Clinton has become part of the 2016 election news cycle once again. He confronted protesters associated with Black Lives Matter who were denouncing the 1994 crime bill, a major piece of legislation that instituted a lot of the policies that drove over-criminalization and hyper-incarceration in the last twenty years.\n\n\"You're defending the people who kill the lives you say matter,\" Clinton told the protesters, attempting to link tough on crime policies (which are popular in urban area and among urban Democratic politicians despite the mainstream rhetoric) to crime reduction.\n\nTwenty years ago the 1994 crime bill passed with broad support. It has become an issue this election cycle given increased interest in issues of police and criminal justice reform. Yet arguments over the crime bill have avoided engaging the uncomfortable truth about the role of bigger government in promoting police violence in favor of rhetorical acrobatics.\n\nFor example even while acknowledging the 1994 crime bill was largely \"a sincere attempt to respond to a real epidemic of violent crime,\" Slate 's Jameille Bouie has to insist there were \"bad actors\" as well. The focus on intentionality in politics is a distraction. The effects policies have on real people matter, not the intentions of the politicians first proposing them. Evaluating how policies will play out on the ground is a more effective way of protecting people from government abuses than the parlor game of trying to divine what's in someone's heart.\n\nIt matters. One revisionist tact taken with the 1994 crime bill is that it was never supported by liberals. Salon , for example, insists Bill Clinton's \"right-leaning New Democrat policy record is a bad fit for today's liberal politics.\" Clinton blames Republicans for forcing him to add tougher provisions to the bill. Yet the 1994 crime bill went through Congress when Democrats controlled both the House and Senate. It was supported by Democrats across the political spectrum, from center-left to hard left. Every member of the leadership of the progressive-leaning Congressional Black Caucus voted for the 1994 crime bill, even as their chairman at the time has now tried to deny he voted in favor of it. 75 percent of House Democrats voted for the bill. They were joined by 46 Republicans and one Independent, the democratic socialist Bernie Sanders.\n\nHillary Clinton receives more focus on the 1994 crime bill because her husband signed it into law, but Bernie Sanders actually voted for the legislation. He says now that was because of provisions about violence against women, but laws are not passed a la carte . Sanders has also claimed police departments are just examples of everyday socialism. Nothing about his rhetoric or policy positions suggests he'd even consider commonsense reform proposals from Black Lives Matter like reforming the police union contracts that often allow officers to kill with almost complete impunity.\n\nSuch exercises aren't just a distraction from solutions like the ones Black Lives Matter's Campaign Zero have proposed, they provide cover for future policy pushes that will also have the effect of exacerbating police violence. Victims of police brutality can no longer afford to have progressives deny that there's nothing about the good intentions of their policies that inoculates them from causing more government violence when they create the legal opportunity for such, especially in communities of poor and marginalized people.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Former CBC Chair Who Voted For 1994 Crime Bill Tries to Cover Up His Role\n\nPolice Abuse\n\nEd Krayewski | 4.30.2015 11:21 AM\n\nKweisi Mfume, a former representative whose congressional district included Baltimore and who was the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) in the 103rd Congress, is trying to disown his and the CBC's role in pushing through the 1994 crime bill. The 1994 bill was the largest crime bill in U.S. history-it added 100,000 new police officers around the country and committed nearly $10 billion to build new prisons. The bill also included an assault weapons ban, to entice Democrats to vote, and a \"midnight basketball\" provision that turned off some Republicans who might otherwise be all over a law and order bill like that. The bill passed 235-195, with most Democrats voting in favor and most Republicans voting against. President Clinton happily signed the bill into law.\n\nNow, some supporters of that bill, instead of acknowledging that they're evolving on the issue of being blindly pro-police, are trying to rewrite the history of how that bill passed a Democrat-controlled Congress and was signed into law by a Democratic president. MSNBC's Chris Hayes asked Mfume about the 1994 bill:\n\nHAYES: Did you vote the wrong way on the Crime Bill in `94?\n\nMFUME: Here`s the thing about the Crime Bill in 1994, there was no vote. It was a voice vote. So you didn`t even have to be there. It was all in favor, aye, all opposed no, and that`s how it passed.\n\nWell, actually, uh, there was also a roll call vote to agree to the conference report. That vote should've been in the research packet Hayes' producers prepared for him. Here it is: http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1994/roll416.xml .\n\nMfume, and the entire leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus of the 103rd Congress, voted for it.\n\nMfume insisted widespread support for the bill was only \"assumed.\" Continuing from the interview:\n\nHAYES: And that`s how uncontroversial the idea was. More cops, three strikes-\n\nMFUME: 41 new categories for the death penalty. Increase in the amount of money for prisons, decrease in the amount of money for prevention.\n\nHAYES: And that was unanimous. That was just a unanimously held opinion across both parties.\n\nMFUME: Well, you know, when you have a vote and say all in favor, aye, and all opposed, no, and there is no roll call, you sort of sweep it under the rug and assume that everybody`s going to support it.\n\nHAYES: The law and order politics that have given us mass incarceration, many people will point to Nixon, particularly the Watts riots, the riots after King that happened near Baltimore in 1968, in Detroit and other places, as the starting point of that, right?\n\nMFUME: Mm-hmm.\n\n1994 was a big milestone on the path that might have started in 1968. And the CBC leadership wasn't a passive supporter of the crime bill. The Baltimore Sun quotes Mfume as saying the CBC wasn't doing Clinton a favor by voting for it, but had \"put our stamp on this bill,\" because in addition to a surge in police officers and prisons, which would disproportionately affect poor, young black people, there was an assault weapons ban and a limit on automatic life sentences for repeat offenders.\n\nIn 2007, when a white representative tried to join the CBC, Rep. William Lacy Clay, Jr. (D-Mo.) insisted the caucus was primarily \"concerned with the needs and concerns of the black population.\" Clay later went on to vote against an amendment that would limit the amount of military gear sent to local police officers just a couple of months before militarized police were deployed around Ferguson, which is part of the district Clay represents. Just 7 out of 41 CBC members voted in favor of limiting police militarization. Back in 1994, only 12 out of 38 CBC members voted against the crime bill, including Reps. John Lewis (D-Ga.) and John Conyers (D-Mich.), both of whom also voted to limit police militarization.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Bill Clinton's Mendacious Defense of the 1994 Crime Bill\n\nPolicy\n\nJacob Sullum | 4.8.2016 7:30 AM\n\nWhile arguing with Black Lives Matter protesters during a speech in Philadelphia yesterday, Bill Clinton made several eyebrow-raising claims about the 1994 crime bill that he signed and his wife supported:\n\nDemocrats included longer prison sentences in the bill only because Republicans demanded them. According to Clinton, Joe Biden, who was the bill's main sponsor in the Senate, said, \"You can't pass this bill, and the Republicans will kill it, if you don't put more sentencing in.\" Yet as first lady, Hillary Clinton cited tougher sentencing rules as one of the bill's main advantages. \"We need more and tougher prison sentences for repeat offenders,\" she said in a 1994 speech. \"The 'three strikes and you're out' for violent offenders has to be part of the plan. We need more prisons to keep violent offenders for as long as it takes to keep them off the streets.\" After the bill passed, the Clinton administration bragged about making sentences longer.\n\nThe 1994 bill caused historic declines in violent crime. \"Because of that bill, we had a 25-year low in crime, a 30-year low in the murder rate,\" Clinton said. \"Because of that and the background check law, we had a 46-year low in the deaths of people by gun violence.\" It's true that violent crime has declined steadily since the early 1990s, and so have gun homicides . But that downard trend began before the 1994 crime bill took effect. While incapacitation of violent criminals played some role in that decline, the federal system accounts for a small share of the prison population, as Clinton emphasized yesterday. And to the extent that the 1994 law encouraged states to be more punitive, Clinton conceded in a 2015 interview with CNN, \"we cast too wide a net and we had too many people in prison,\" contributing to the \"mass incarceration\" his wife now decries . Clinton's claim about the impact of the Brady Law, which required background checks for people who buy guns from federally licensed dealers, is even more dubious .\n\nCrack-related homicides are committed under the influence of crack. \"I don't know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out onto the street to murder other African-American children,\" he told protesters. \"Maybe you thought they were good citizens. She didn't.\" Contrary to the picture Clinton draws, so-called crack-related homicides are not caused by stimulant-fueled aggression. A 1997 analysis of \"crack-related\" homicides in New York City found that 85 percent were \"systemic,\" meaning they grew out of black-market disputes. About 7 percent occurred during crimes committed to support a crack habit. Only one homicide out of 118 involved a perpetrator who was high on crack. In other words, the vast majority of the violence that Clinton says motivated the 1994 crime bill is a predictable consequence of the prohibition policy he and his wife continue to support.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Donald Trump Attacks Joe Biden for Supporting 'Superpredator' Crime Bill\n\nReason Roundup\n\nRobby Soave | 5.28.2019 9:30 AM\n\nPresident Donald Trump criticized former Vice President Joe Biden over the latter's support for the 1994 Crime Bill, a bipartisan piece of legislation that exacerbated inequities in the criminal justice system and is associated with the racially loaded term \"superpredator.\"\n\n\"Super Predator was the term associated with the 1994 Crime Bill that Sleepy Joe Biden was so heavily involved in passing,\" said Trump in a tweet. \"That was a dark period in American History, but has Sleepy Joe apologized? No!\"\n\nIn a subsequent tweet, Trump touted his own criminal justice reform efforts:\n\nAnyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected. In particular, African Americans will not be able to vote for you. I, on the other hand, was responsible for Criminal Justice Reform, which had tremendous support, & helped fix the bad 1994 Bill!\n\n- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 27, 2019\n\nIt's true that Trump has made some significant strides on criminal justice reform: He signed the FIRST STEP Act into law , which erased crack cocaine sentencing disparities for certain incarcerated persons, allowing them to go free.\n\nTrump going after Biden for previous performative toughness on crime is a bit ironic since Trump ran on a fairly standard law-and-order platform when he sought the presidency in 2016. But President Trump has proven more interested in criminal justice reform than expected. ( Thank you, Kim Kardashian West .)\n\nBiden, of course, will have to deal with the fact that many of his former political positions-his role in the crime bill, his support for the Iraq War -are out of step with the leftward drift of the Democratic Party. Assuming this doesn't actually cost him the nomination, the general election is going to be fascinating.\n\nActivists at Princeton University are demanding that the administration create and fund an \"Office of Intersectional Violence Investigation,\" which would explore the harms to students who languish under the oppression of more than one kind of -ism. The Atlantic 's Conor Friedersdorf reports:\n\nIn our correspondence, I asked about a hypothetical in which the activists' suggested reforms turned out to cost $20 million a year. Could they justify that price tag? The activists were undaunted.\n\nFor context, \"during the 2017-2018 academic year,\" Princeton notes of its Title IX proceedings, \"there were 17 cases in which respondents were found responsible for sexual misconduct, and 16 cases in which respondents were found not responsible.\" The $20 million-a-year figure would be sufficient to give all confirmed victims of sexual assault $1 million each in cash . And I've seen no conclusive evidence that increasing the size of Title IX bureaucracies reduces the incidence of sexual assault on campus or meaningfully diminishes the pain or trauma of victims.\n\nIntersectionality, the idea that different kinds of oppression are distinct but related, and must all be opposed with equal fervor, has become the core philosophy of progressive activists. I explore why this is so in my new book, Panic Attack: Young Radicals in the Age of Trump .\n\nThe Brexit Party performed well in the European Parliament elections, which took place Thursday through Sunday. The results were a win for euro-skeptics, populists, and nationalists, but also the pro-EU left and the greens. Centrist parties had a bad showing , and the coalition led by the center-right European People's Party and the center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats lost its governing majority.\n\nIn Britain, both the Conservative and Labor Parties suffered bruising defeats-in fact, Conservatives won just eight percent of the vote. Prime Minister Theresa May has already indicated she would step down.\n\nAccording to The New York Times :\n\nIn effect, voters appear to have flocked to parties that either took an uncompromising stance in favor of Brexit, or those that oppose it altogether - abandoning the Conservative Party and Labour, which have, in their different ways, been trying to offer some sort of compromise.\n\nThe results underscore the growing polarization of British politics over Brexit, pointing to yet more political uncertainty and volatility in a country that has been in various degrees of political crisis since 2016, when voters opted in a referendum to leave the European Union.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Anti-Gun Hysteria Illustrates How Monstrosities Like the 1994 Crime Bill and the War on Terror Come to Pass\n\nGun Rights\n\nEd Krayewski | 6.20.2016 10:01 PM\n\nThe Senate voted down four separate gun control proposals earlier tonight, leading to much hand-wringing by liberals, who have ratcheted the rhetoric up to eleven in order to take advantage of the emotions surrounding the Orlando massacre to get the gun control measures they've always supported passed.\n\nThat tact requires certain dangerous misrepresentations of reality. Just this weekend, the Department of Justice said it would redact references to the Islamic State (ISIS) from 911 calls from the Orlando shooting, so as not to \"further his propaganda.\" Tonight, to further their own propaganda, Democrats literally accused Senate Republicans of selling weapons to ISIS*. The Obama administration has mostly avoided overstating the threat ISIS poses in a way that would make it easier to push a more intense intervention in Iraq and Syria, but Democrats are happy to overstate the threat posed by ISIS to curtail Americans' rights.\n\nThe Fourth and Fifth Amendment have long been popular targets in such exercises, the addition of the Second to the mix by Democrats isn't particularly surprising. Yet, once people are riled up over a threat presented by the ruling class to push through one set of policies, there's nothing to prevent those in power from using the same emotions to push through different policies. If Republicans are arming ISIS, Democrats are importing them. Democrats' professed support for refugee-friendly immigration policies offers no guarantee that the fearmongering in which Democrats are engaging doesn't also make other arguments based off the same fear more potent.\n\nMore broadly, Democrats have been pushing the idea that the United States is a uniquely unsafe country, a primary justification for their anti-gun policies. Liberal pundit Touré, like many others, framed the issue as one between a powerful gun lobby and \"the dire need to address our horrific gun violence epidemic.\" Yet, as David Harsanyi pointed out on Twitter, the homicide rate has been on a decline, and is the lowest it's been since 1963 .\n\nThe hysteria on the left, troubling in the way it focuses on the systemic deprivation of constitutional rights, is illustrative of how such policies have passed in the past. It was only a few months ago that progressives were excoriating Bill Clinton (and Hillary) for his support of the 1994 crime bill, identified as a primary driver of increased incarceration rates in the 1990s and 2000s. Supporters of the 1994 bill, like then-chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Kweisi Mfume, tried to whitewash their support of the bill. Hillary Clinton was lambasted for comments she made at the time about \"super predators\" that threatened safety in inner cities. Gun homicides are down 49 percent since their peak in 1993.\n\nCrime rates were higher in the early 1990s, when the crime bill was being debated on and passed, then it is today. Yet despite the attention criminal justice reform received during the Democratic primary process, some of the same voices who faulted the Clintons for creating a climate of fear in order to implement policies that systematically violated the constitutional rights of marginalized communities are today creating a climate of fear in order to implement policies that systematically violated the constitutional rights of marginalized communities.\n\n*This issue is swimming in so much hypocritical bullshit I almost forgot the rich relevance of this: \" ISIS armed with U.S. weapons \"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Trump Claims Biden Called Black Americans 'Superpredators.' That Was Hillary Clinton.\n\nDebates 2020\n\nC.J. Ciaramella | 9.29.2020 11:57 PM\n\nPresident Donald Trump attacked Democratic nominee Joe Biden at tonight's debate for his role in passing tough-on-crime legislation and supposedly calling black Americans \"superpredators\" years ago.\n\n\"I'm letting people out of jail now,\" Trump said to Biden. \"You've treated the black community as bad as anyone in the country. You called them superpredators and you've called them worse than that.\"\n\nTrump has previously attacked Joe Biden for his role in crafting the 1994 crime bill, formally known as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. It was Hillary Clinton , however, who infamously uttered the term \"superpredators\" back in 1996. (You can still find plenty of videos of floor speeches of then-Senator Biden railing against \"predators\" or generally demagoguing on the subject of violent crime.)\n\nThe rise of criminal justice reform as a major issue in politics has made the 1994 crime bill a liability for Biden, who has since apologized for his role in tough-on-crime legislation passed in the 1980s and '90s by large bipartisan margins.\n\nIn a speech last year on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Biden said those bills \"trapped an entire generation,\" and that \"it was a big mistake when it was made.\"\n\nThis has also led Trump, in an attempt to cut into Biden's support among black voters, to attack Biden for both being too harsh on crime in the past and not believing in \"law and order\" now.\n\nHowever, the popular narrative about the '94 crime bill isn't correct. Fordham Law professor John Pfaff has argued persuasively that, though it was certainly a bad bill, it neither created mass incarceration-which was already chugging along by the 1990s-nor was a significant driver of imprisonment.\n\nThe bill created several draconian mandatory minimum sentences at the federal level and dangled grants for new prisons and new tough-on-crime laws for states, but mass incarceration is predominantly a state-level phenomenon.\n\n\"Its effect on crime was consistently hampered by the sheer size of state and local justice systems, diminishing any impact it might have made for good or for ill,\" Pfaff wrote in a 2016 New York Times Op-Ed. \"And in many ways, the debates over it are largely symbolic.\"\n\nThere are plenty of other terrible criminal justice bills that Biden co-sponsored during his long tenure in the Senate, such as the massive expansion of civil asset forfeiture and the crackdowns on juvenile offenders . But in a \"debate\" that was little more than two candidates yelling over each other, there wasn't much room for anything other than vague symbology.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Kamala Harris Is So 'Radical,' Trump's Campaign Says, That She Criticized Joe Biden's Criminal Justice Record. So Does Trump.\n\nCriminal Justice\n\nJacob Sullum | 8.12.2020 1:50 PM\n\nPresident Donald Trump's re-election campaign, which is depicting Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Joe Biden's vice presidential pick, as \"far left\" and \"radical,\" was quick to note that the senator has criticized her running mate's draconian record on criminal justice issues. Yet so have the Trump campaign and the president himself, which makes it hard to tell whether this point is meant to reflect badly on Harris or on Biden.\n\n\"Harris has repeatedly slammed Biden, going so far as to say that he supported racist policies that hurt the Black community,\" says a press release from the Trump campaign. \"Harris said Biden's 1994 crime bill 'contribute[d] to mass incarceration' in the U.S.\"\n\nThat's a quote from comments that Harris made last May in response to Biden's defense of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act-or \"the 1994 Biden Crime Bill,\" as he prefers to call it . \"I have a great deal of respect for Vice President Joe Biden, but I disagree,\" Harris told reporters in New Hampshire. \"That crime bill, that 1994 crime bill, it did contribute to mass incarceration in this country.\" She noted that it \"was the first time that we had a federal three-strikes law,\" requiring a life sentence for anyone convicted of a violent crime after committing two other offenses (violent or not). She suggested that provision \"encouraged\" similar laws at the state level. Harris also noted that the bill \"funded the building of more prisons,\" which was contingent on state passage of \"truth in sentencing\" laws that limited or abolished parole.\n\nThe Trump campaign points out that Harris also has criticized Biden for bragging about his collaboration with former segregationists. While the context of that criticism was a spat about busing during a Democratic presidential debate in June, Biden has specifically cited his work with Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) on the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, which began a pattern of harsh mandatory minimum sentences that continued into the 1990s, as an inspiring example of bipartisanship. During that period, Biden was eager to show that Democrats could be at least as tough on crime and drugs as Republicans. In a 1993 Senate floor speech, he boasted that \"every major crime bill since 1976 that's come out of this Congress, every minor crime bill, has had the name of the Democratic senator from the State of Delaware: Joe Biden.\"\n\nBiden's criminal justice record is so appalling that the Trump campaign has attacked him from the left on the issue. \"In addition to wrecking countless lives with the 1994 crime bill, during his time in the Senate, Biden's 'priority' was legislation that policy experts agree made the opioid epidemic far more deadly,\" it said in a March 4 press release . \"Biden pioneered legislation that decreases the likelihood of people to call 911 if they witness a drug overdose and has even led to prosecutors filing homicide charges against drug overdose victims' loved ones.\"\n\nThe latter claim was based on a provision of the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act that prescribed a sentence of 20 years to life for drug distribution when it results in death. Like many Biden-backed anti-drug policies enacted in the 1980s and '90s, that provision ostensibly was aimed at \"kingpins\" who make a fortune by selling drugs that kill people. But prosecutions for \" drug-induced homicide \" (mostly at the state level) usually involve low-level dealers and acquaintances close to overdose victims, since those are the cases in which the causal link is easiest to prove. And the Trump campaign is right that such cases can involve \"homicide charges against drug overdose victims' loved ones.\" These prosecutions are not only cruel and unjust; they are potentially deadly, since fear of homicide charges is a powerful deterrent to calling 911 when someone overdoses.\n\n\"Mass incarceration has put hundreds of thousands behind bars for minor offenses,\" says a Trump campaign video released in May. \"Joe Biden wrote those laws.\" In a June 2 blog post , the campaign slammed Biden as \"the chief architect of mass incarceration and the War on Drugs, which targeted Black Americans.\"\n\nLast year Trump himself criticized Biden for supporting criminal justice policies that had a disproportionate impact on African Americans. \"Anyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected,\" he tweeted . \"In particular, African Americans will not be able to vote for you. I, on the other hand, was responsible for Criminal Justice Reform, which had tremendous support, & helped fix the bad 1994 Bill!\"\n\nBiden has repudiated the myriad mandatory minimums and death penalties he once championed, saying they should be abolished. He also wants to eliminate the irrational sentencing disparity between the smoked and snorted forms of cocaine, which was created by the 1986 law and reduced by the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 . He says that distinction, which led to strikingly unequal treatment of black drug offenders, was \" a big mistake \" based on misinformation. And while continuing to resist the repeal of federal marijuana prohibition, Biden now calls for decriminalizing cannabis consumption and automatically expunging \"all prior cannabis use convictions\" (neither of which would have much of an impact at the federal level, since the Justice Department rarely prosecutes low-level marijuana cases).\n\nTrump, by contrast, barely talks about criminal justice reform, beyond occasionally touting his support for the FIRST STEP Act and his commutation of a few drug sentences. The \"Law and Justice\" page on his campaign website says nothing about those actions or any further steps toward a less arbitrarily punitive criminal justice system. Yet despite his Nixonian \"law and order\" rhetoric, Trump has intermittently shown seemingly genuine concern about the \"very unfair\" drug penalties that Biden pushed for decades.\n\nWhether or not Biden's conversion is sincere, it seems unlikely that he could get away with reverting to his old drug-warrior ways given the current climate of opinion among Democrats and Americans generally. Harris, whose own record in this area as a local prosecutor and California's attorney general is nothing to brag about , likewise has \"evolved\" in response to shifting Democratic opinion and in some respects goes further than Biden. In 2018, after resisting marijuana legalization for years, Harris said she wanted to \"decriminalize marijuana nationwide.\" Last year she was the lead Senate sponsor of the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment, and Expungement Act, which would repeal federal pot prohibition by removing cannabis from the federal lists of \"controlled substances.\"\n\nTrump wants to have it both ways with Biden's criminal justice record, criticizing it as senselessly harsh when that's convenient and citing Harris' similar criticism as evidence of her \"radical\" proclivities when that seems like a more effective rhetorical tack. It would be interesting to see a debate between Trump and Biden about these issues, since it would give Trump a chance to clarify his position and give Biden a chance to forthrightly address his egregious misjudgments. But it seems unlikely that will happen, given Biden's reluctance to admit that his proudest accomplishments as a senator were disastrous and Trump's reluctance to antagonize conservatives who see nothing wrong with that record.\n\n[This post has been revised to include more criticism of Joe Biden's criminal justice record from the Trump campaign.]\n\nStart your day with Reason .

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nThe conservative political action committee American Principles Project is accusing Facebook of attempting to \"silence Black voices\" after the social media giant took down an anti-Joe Biden ad that targeted minority voters with criticism of the Democratic candidate's history in Congress.\n\nThe one-minute ad shows then-Senator Biden speaking in favor of a controversial 1994 crime bill and tells voters that he supports Black Lives Matter, which the ad accuses of wanting to \"keep Black men from raising their children.\"\n\nBLOOMBERG MAKES MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR, LAST-MINUTE PUSH FOR BIDEN IN TEXAS, OHIO\n\nPresident Trump , who's fighting for a second term in the White House, brought up the legislation -- which critics say led to an increase in the number of Black men incarcerated -- in a debate with the Democratic challenger last week.\n\nWhile the legislation was widely supported when it was passed in the early 1990s, as communities across the U.S. fought rising crime amid the crack epidemic, Biden later said the bill was \"a mistake.\"\n\nThe American Principles Project ad's narrator, a Black woman, voiced the same opinion:  \"I needed my dad -- more than anything,\" she says. \"Black lives, Black families, and Black futures do matter, Mr. Biden, and it starts at home.\"\n\nFacebook removed the video on Saturday after a fact-check from Lead Stories concluded that there was \"no evidence\" of the claims that Biden \"endorsed the organization or the exclusion of Black men from child-rearing.\"\n\nThe ad had reportedly cited a recently-deleted statement from the Black Lives Matter Global Network's website, saying that the group \"[disrupts] the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and 'villages' that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.\"\n\nThe page has since been archived .\n\n\"Although Biden does lay out a plan on his website for addressing systemic racism, Lead Stories searched the BLM website and Google and found no instance of the candidate's formal endorsement of it,\" the fact-checking website said.\n\nIn a statement responding to the move, American Principles Project Executive Director Terry Schilling said he was not surprised by Facebook's action.\n\nIn September, the Menlo Park, Calif.-based company also removed a video attacking Democratic Michigan Sen. Gary Peters for his support of the Equality Act, which aims to prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\n\"The company's actions over the last few weeks have made it clear that it will do whatever it takes to ensure Joe Biden is elected president, whether that means removing anti-Biden ads on absurd grounds or burying news stories which make Biden look bad,\" wrote Schilling.\n\n\"But the idea that some left-wing fact-checker who failed to do even a cursory level of research on the issue should have the authority to silence Black voices?\" he asked. \"To prevent them from describing how Joe Biden's policies would affect the Black community?

Market data provided by Factset .\n          Powered and implemented by FactSet Digital Solutions . Legal Statement .\n\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2025 FOX News Network, LLC. All rights reserved. FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nMike Bloomberg seems like the last Democratic presidential candidate who would gain an endorsement from Bobby L. Rush, the long-time south side Chicago congressman, civil rights leader and former Black Panther. Bloomberg, aside from making his billions on Wall Street, served three terms as mayor of New York City where he supported the aggressive policing tactic \"stop-and-frisk\" that civil rights leaders vilified as unfairly profiling and targeting African Americans.\n\nBut in an interview with FOX Business, Rush says he has no second thoughts about his surprise endorsement of Bloomberg earlier this month. The choice initially looked like a gamble, but now is beginning to look like a solid bet as Bloomberg rises in national polls against Democratic front-runners like independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden and progressive Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to the extent that some political insiders see a possible path to victory.\n\nWe can't be energized by the sentimentality of having an African American president\n\n\"Bloomberg now has momentum, sustainability, and can actually get it done,\" Rush said in an interview. \"Trump says he plans to spend $1 billion, but Bloomberg has already pledged to spend $2 billion.\" Fox Business was first to report Bloomberg's $2 billion spending plan .\n\nTWO BILLION REASONS BLOOMBERG COULD UNSEAT TRUMP\n\nRush isn't ignoring Bloomberg's mistakes; he called stop-and-frisk policing \"disgusting.\" But he says every candidate has been apologizing for policies or votes that have negatively affected the black community. Bloomberg recently called stop-and-frisk \"really wrong\" after years of defending the policy, and as Rush points out, Joe Biden has apologized for supporting the 1994 crime bill that some say disproportionately affected blacks. And Warren issued a mea culpa for claiming she had Native American ancestry.\n\nSanders has been criticized for a lack of diversity in his campaign staff, while polling very low with older African American voters, who tend to be more conservative than the self-described Democratic-socialist. Sanders also supported the '94 Crime Bill.\n\nBut what makes Bloomberg far better than the other candidates in the race, Rush says, is that he will enact economic policies that will do more to strengthen the black community than any other candidate - even Sanders, who is running on a platform of massive redistribution of wealth to poor people through higher taxes and a vast expansion of the welfare state with programs like \"Medicare-for-all.\"\n\nRush, who has served in Congress since 1993, describes himself as a realist. And while Sanders's platform might sound good, much of it is unrealistic given how far left he wants to take the country. In that belief, he joins another prominent African American politician, former President Obama, in being skeptical of a Sanders presidency, as FOX Business recently reported .\n\nBLOOMBERG'S BILLIONS COULD HELP BIDEN, DEPENDING ON SUPER TUESDAY RESULTS\n\nObama, as reported by Fox Business, prefers his former vice president, Biden, who polls well with blacks in part because of this association. But Rush believes Biden and the others all lack a specific plan for black economic development that Bloomberg has offered.\n\nRush cites Bloomberg's \"Greenwood Initiative,\" an economic development plan named after the famous African-American financial district in Tulsa, Okla., that was decimated during race riots in 1921. Under the plan, Bloomberg plans to spend $70 billion to increase homeownership and business in blighted communities of color across the country.\n\nBloomberg now has momentum, sustainability, and can actually get it done.\n\n\"The typical white family's net worth is $171,000 while the typical net worth of black families is $17,000 and that difference is largely tied to a lack of homeownership in the black community,\" Rush said. \"None of the other candidates are specific on these issues. We don't want generalities. Bloomberg will invest $70 billion in my community. That is specific.\"\n\nThe 73-year old Congressman agrees that the sentimental choice of many African Americans for president is Biden, but he adds now is not the time to be sentimental given the economic issues facing black Americans, and more importantly the need to defeat President Trump, which Bloomberg with his unlimited resources can do better than any Democrat running.\n\nOBAMA FEELS SANDERS IS UNFIT TO BATTLE TRUMP - AND HE HAS TOLD PEOPLE HE MIGHT SAY SO PUBLICLY\n\nPeople who know Rush say his choice to bypass Biden was no surprise even if his Bloomberg endorsement was; Rush is said to personally dislike Obama from their days in Chicago political circles. Rush was the only politician to beat Obama in a political race after the former president challenged him for his congressional seat in 2000 losing to Rush in a particularly nasty primary battle.\n\nBut Rush said personal animus has nothing to do with his support for Bloomberg. He adds that he was one of the first prominent politicians to endorse Obama for president and continues to hold the former president in high regard.\n\nMoreover now is not the time to look to the past, he said.\n\n\"Obama was a real president of African American advancement, an important figure for African Americans to see,\" he said. \"But we can't be energized by that as important as it was ... We can't be energized by the sentimentality of having an African American president ... We need to be focused on someone who can create policies that help the African American community.\"\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nBloomberg is sitting out the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary in February to focus on the \"Super Tuesday\" races in March. Rush says as the former New York City mayor gains in national polls, the odds are growing for a so-called brokered convention, where no clear-cut winner emerges when the first ballots are taken at the Democratic convention in July. Those seeking the nomination need to campaign to woo delegates to their camp during the convention to secure a majority.\n\nThat's where Bloomberg, using his financial might to woo voters - with ads and get-out-the vote efforts - will emerge in later ballots as the clear winner and could easily beat Trump on Election Day given the president's unpopularity and Bloomberg's ability to outspend any opponent.\n\nWe don't want generalities. Bloomberg will invest $70 billion in my community. That is specific.\n\nBloomberg, or any Democratic candidate, will have their work cut out for them during the general election. Trump will run on a strong economy, and he has already been touting the decline in black unemployment to record lows. During the 2016 election, polls showed African American turnout to be far lower than during the Obama years.\n\nRush says those economic numbers are deceiving because of the continued wealth gap faced by African Americans and Rush believes the true base of the Democratic Party - the African American voter - will see through Trump's spin and turn out for Bloomberg because of his economic policies and sealing an election night victory in the fall.\n\n\"Lots of people, over half of the Congressional Black Caucus members have expressed interest in Bloomberg to me,\" Rush said. \"I'm getting lots of approval from and congratulations from CBC members on my endorsement of Bloomberg because he can beat Trump.\"\n\nRush added: \"The Democratic Party needs to take their base out of the basement ... that's why I'm endorsing Bloomberg.\"\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., introduced the legislation on Tuesday, with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., joining as a co-sponsor.\n\nGaetz and Greene are two of Trump's most vocal allies on Capitol Hill.\n\n\"As the cost of living continues to rise, the hardworking men and women in the service industry, many of whom may be working a second job to make ends meet, must be allowed to keep every dollar of tip money they earn,\" Gaetz wrote on X.\n\nIN-N-OUT RAISES CALIFORNIA PRICES IN RESPONSE TO MINIMUM WAGE HIKE\n\nFormer President Trump suggested stopping taxes on tipped wages.

He said in a press release statement, \"With inflation raging, it only makes sense to eliminate the tax on tips and provide relief to working folks.\"\n\nHowever, not all Republicans are sold on the idea, despite Trump's support.\n\nRep.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nJoe Biden's campaign is in trouble. That means the Democrats are in trouble. If his problems take him out of the race, who's left to run against the president? Just the socialists. No wonder there is internal descent among democrats. After all, if it's not Biden, can Bernie, or Elizabeth Warren win? Put me in the skeptic's column. And I don't care what the polls say.\n\nSo what's Joe's problem? His past, and his attempts to reverse, explain or re-engineer all the things he's done and said in the last 46 years in politics.\n\nThis week, his problem is his association with segregationists in the 1970's. Back then, he sought their help in opposing bussing to achieve racial integration in schools. On Wednesday Biden said it was a relationship he \"had to put up with\".\n\nBut back then, he had written letters saying he was flattered and grateful to the segregationists for their help. Those letters have now emerged. Joe has a problem. In today's Democrat party, it's very hard to be \"moderate\" on race.\n\nAnd you can't be a moderate on abortion either: that's why Biden had to reverse his position:  for 40 years he had supported the ban on taxpayer funding. He's now withdrawn that support.\n\nA few months ago, he said vice president Pence was \"a decent guy\". He had to apologize! No democrat is allowed to say anything nice about anyone in the Trump team.\n\nHe supported the 1994 crime bill. So did Bill Clinton. 25 years later that bill gets the blame for the \"mass incarceration of African Americans\". Now he says \"I haven't always been right\".\n\nAnd then there's climate change. Joe Biden wanted a middle of the road policy. That didn't last long: Bernie Sanders said \"there is no middle ground\". Joe caved and signed on to the fantasy land of the green new deal.\n\nNext week the Democrat debates begin. Joe Biden will have a tough time of it. He's the front runner: he'll be attacked. And his opponents have plenty of ammunition. And then it will be on to the primaries: and he will have to run the gauntlet all over again. You think the activists who dominate primary voting will give him an easy time? No way.\n\nThe Democrats seem to believe that if they push Biden out, a far left candidate can win. I don't believe it.\n\nIf he's out, do not assume that another Democrat gets in.  Trump's prosperity beats socialism.

Not just saying, 'Hey, I'm oppressed too!'\"\n\nCharlamagne made headlines recently when he repeatedly questioned 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren about her longtime claim of Native American ancestry. He even compared Warren at one point to Rachel Dolezal, a former NAACP Spokane chapter president who falsely claimed to be black for years.\n\n\"People acted like that comparison was so off, but I mean, if you were saying that you were Native American and you got some type of benefit from that,\" he said. \"And she said she didn't, but how does she know - how does she know she didn't?\"\n\nCritics of America's criminal justice system have long held that it negatively affects communities of color in a disproportionate way and multiple 2020 candidates are facing questions about their tough-on-crime pasts.\n\nFOX Business' Kennedy asserted that 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and California Senator Kamala Harris developed a \"sketchy track record\" during her time as District Attorney of San Francisco and Attorney General of California. Charlamagne pointed out that other candidates need to answer for their involvement in a 1994 crime bill that many criminal justice reform advocates partly blame for America's mass incarceration.\n\n\"Joe Biden wrote the '94 crime bill, so he got a lot of people locked up too,\" he said. \"And Bernie Sanders voted for the '94 crime bill.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nA California cannabis industry group announced Tuesday that it reached an agreement with a state credit union that will provide checking, wire transfers and other banking services for more marijuana companies, helping ease what has been an obstacle for many businesses.\n\nMost Americans live in states where cannabis is legally available in some form, and broad legal marijuana sales began in California in 2018. But there's been a problem when it comes to banks: Many don't want anything to do with money from the cannabis industry for fear it could expose them to legal trouble from the federal government, which still considers marijuana illegal.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nAs a result, many marijuana companies in California's multibillion-dollar market have been left to do business largely in cash, making them appealing targets for crime.\n\nUnder the partnership, the California Cannabis Industry Association said its members will gain access to banking services through the California-based North Bay Credit Union.\n\nFILE - In this June 27, 2017, file photo, bundles of $20 bills are placed on a table as Jerred Kiloh, owner of the Higher Path medical marijuana dispensary, prepares a trip to Los Angeles City Hall to pay his monthly tax payment in cash in Los Angele\n\n\"Since California legalized cannabis, operators have faced significant struggles with banking and payment services, given the federal government's continued ban on cannabis products,\" the group said in a statement. The agreement is intended \"to alleviate the banking obstacles that cannabis operators face, so they can focus on their core business.\"\n\nIndustry experts say the number of state financial institutions willing to handle cannabis-linked funds is gradually growing, and a state law enacted last year was designed to provide legal safeguards for banks and credit unions engaging with marijuana companies.\n\nNY MARIJUANA TAX COULD LIGHT UP BLACK MARKET: CANNABIS INDUSTRY OFFICIAL\n\nThe credit union said on its website that it has been offering banking services to the cannabis industry since 2017. Medicinal cannabis sales have been legal in California for over two decades.\n\nJerred Kiloh, who heads the Los Angeles-based United Cannabis Business Association, said the agreement represents another encouraging step as more financial institutions open their doors to the industry.\n\nFILE - This Oct. 20, 2018, file photo shows marijuana clone plants displayed for sale by Interstate 5 Farms at the cannabis-themed Kushstock Festival at Adelanto, Calif. The leading cannabis industry group in California announced Tuesday, Jan. 19, 20\n\nWith growing acceptance of cannabis nationwide, along with regulatory changes, \"there are more banks that are willing to tell people they are willing to accept cannabis accounts,\" he said.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, federal regulators reported that 677 banks and credit unions were providing services for marijuana business. That represents a small fraction of the overall banking industry, and the figure had declined slightly in 2020, a drop attributed in part to business closings caused by coronavirus restrictions.\n\nMAINE MARIJUANA SHOPS REPORT BRISK BUSINESS DESPITE PANDEMIC\n\nEfforts to broaden banking access for pot companies have stalled in Congress.\n\nThe House in September passed a bill to allow businesses legitimately operating under state laws to access loans, lines of credit and other banking services, while sheltering financial institutions from prosecution for handling marijuana-linked money, but it didn't clear the Senate.\n\nThe industry is hoping for regulatory gains in Washington with the arrival of the new administration and Democratic control of the Senate.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden was once known as an anti-drug warrior but has softened his tone over time. He has said he would decriminalize - but not legalize - the use of marijuana, while expunging all prior cannabis use convictions and ending jail time for drug use alone. However, legalization advocates recall with bitterness that he was a leading Senate supporter of a 1994 crime bill that sent droves of minor drug offenders to prison.\n\nEven if there are doubts within the industry about Biden, the Democratic Party is clearly more welcoming to cannabis reform, especially its progressive wing. Both the House and Senate will be under Democratic control this year, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris has said making pot legal at the federal level is the \"smart thing to do.\"\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

His swing to progressive policies -- and pardons -- may have diluted that legacy.\n\nPublished: January 5, 2025 10:32pm\n\nOnce the author of a major crime, security, and law enforcement package, President Joe Biden will leave public office in the wake of suspected terrorist attacks and gang shootings that has opponents chastising his handling of the issues nationwide.\n\nOn New Year's Day, New Orleans became the scene of a terrorist attack when Shamsud Din Jabbar, a U.S. Army veteran and citizen, drove through a crowded French Quarter street at high speed, killing at least 14 and injuring dozens others. In Las Vegas, a driver identified as Matthew Livelsberger, 37, a resident of Colorado Springs and an Army veteran, drove a Tesla Cybertruck to the entrance of the Trump Hotel and detonated it. The explosion was largely limited to the vehicle and only the driver died in that incident. Both incidents are under investigation as acts of terrorism.\n\nWednesday evening, moreover, saw ten people shot in a drive by shooting outside a Queens, N.Y. nightclub. Authorities are investigating possible gang connections to that incident. The New York City area, moreover, is still reeling from the immolation of a subway passenger by a suspected Guatemalan migrant in mid-December.\n\nThe string of lethal altercations over a short time frame has Americans increasingly worried about security shortcomings and criminal vulnerabilities as some analysts warn of a new era of terrorism against soft targets and crowded spaces.\n\n\"With the Biden 'Open Border's Policy' I said, many times during Rallies, and elsewhere, that Radical Islamic Terrorism, and other forms of violent crime, will become so bad in America that it will become hard to even imagine or believe,\" President-elect Donald Trump posted on Truth Social. \"That time has come, only worse than ever imagined.\"\n\nOne of Biden's hallmark legislative accomplishments was a 1994 crime bill that raised the minimum penalties for a wide array of offenses and imposed an assault weapons ban. Throughout his Senate career, Biden was a vocal proponent of tough-on-crime measures. At one point, he recommended a shotgun for home defense, saying \"Jill, if there's ever a problem just walk out on the balcony here ... put that double-barreled shotgun and fire two blasts outside the house.\"\n\nHis record on those issues, however, proved somewhat embarrassing for him while running for president amid the defund-the-police movement. Trump also repeatedly blasted the bill, asserting that it led to mass incarceration of black Americans for non-violent offenses.\n\nBiden stopped shy of openly embracing the defund the police movement, but gradually moved further to the left on law enforcement issues throughout the campaign and his presidency. In mid-December alone, Biden announced the single largest act of executive branch clemency in modern U.S. history by pardoning 39 people and commuting the sentences of roughly 1,500 more.\n\nMany of those whose sentences were commuted were people convicted in killings, including the slayings of police and military officers, people on federal land and those involved in deadly bank robberies or drug deals, as well as the killings of guards or prisoners in federal facilities, according to NPR .\n\n\"The President recognizes how the clemency power can advance equal justice under law and remedy harms caused by practices of the past,\" a statement from the White House read.\n\nHis own sweeping pardon of his son Hunter that protected him from any and all crimes -- including potential gun charges --  he may have committed since 2014 also placed an asterisk on his \"law and order\" record.\n\nBiden's administration was further marked by a litany of scandals involving federal law enforcement and the apparent targeting of perceived political opponents, such as traditional Roman Catholics and concerned parents opposed to transgender policies in public schools. His Department of Justice, moreover, attracted scrutiny for pursuing allegedly politicized cases against Trump as he ran to reclaim the White House.\n\nThough each scandal generated outrage at the time, they returned to the forefront in the wake of the terror attacks, with some asserting that federal law enforcement were too concerned with politicized investigations and prosecutions to adequately monitor genuine security threats.\n\n\"Biden's FBI is more concerned with woke DEI initiatives and spying on its citizens than protecting Americans from credible threats,\" Rep. Andy Biggs , R-Ariz., said. \"President Trump and the next FBI Director have an uphill battle ahead of them.\"\n\n\"The FBI was too busy spying on school board parents, pastors, and the wives of congressional staffers to be bothered with stopping ISIS attacks before they happen,\" Federalist CEO Sean Davis said of revelations that Din Jabbar had joined ISIS before the Summer of 2024.\n\nThe FBI confirmed on Thursday that Din Jabbar had posted five videos to his Facebook account prior to his rampage in which he expressed support for the Islamic State and said he joined the terrorist organization months before.\n\nIn a public post on social media, Biden himself insisted that the FBI would take the lead on investigating the terrorist attacks and that his own government would not permit attacks on Americans.\n\n\"My heart goes out to the victims and their families who were simply trying to celebrate the holiday,\" he said . \"There is no justification for violence of any kind, and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation's communities.\""

But though Trump has focused on similar issues with that constituency, he has noticeably tailored his pitch toward the black community in recent rallies, emphasizing crime and criminal justice reform in light of his own conviction and visiting major American cities that are home to many black voters.\n\nThe campaign announced a June 22 rally in Philadelphia on Monday, following up on his weekend appearance in Detroit and his prior efforts in New York City and the surrounding area. A major population center in a swing state, Philadelphia was also a major focus of Trump's election fraud claims during the 2020 election.\n\n\"The Biden campaign sees that President Trump is up to 23% in the polls in battleground states with Black voters, a record high that we haven't seen in decades,\" Trump Campaign Black Media Director Janiyah Thomas told Just the News . \"President Trump knows that Black voters prefer lower taxes, which he delivered in his first term, and like all Americans, oppose Biden's hiking tax rates. Ultimately, President Trump's economic policies offered more opportunities to build generational wealth for Black families.\"\n\nThe black vote in 2020\n\nTrump earned 8% support among black voters in the 2020 election, compared to Biden's 92%, according to the Pew Research Center. The final result stood in stark contrast to polling data that cycle which had suggested Trump was poised to win a considerably larger slice of the black electorate in 2020, including data suggesting he would claim a percentage in the mid-20s and enjoyed unexpectedly high approval ratings among minority communities.\n\nIn 2020, the black electorate was particularly energized in light of the death of George Floyd and the nationwide demonstrations seeking police and criminal justice reform. Trump, eager to win over the voting bloc, tailored his pitch to address their concerns.\n\nTrump in 2018 signed the First Step Act , a criminal justice reform bill that addressed minimum mandatory sentences and other reforms to incarceration practices. The legislation featured heavily in Trump's campaign messaging at the time.\n\nHe further unveiled the \" Platinum Plan ,\" a policy agenda focusing on economic opportunity for black Americans, the creation of small businesses in those communities, health care, and other crime and safety issues. Going into the election, moreover, Trump racked up endorsements from high-profile rappers such as 50 cent, Lil Wayne, and Lil Pump.\n\nIn the end, however, Trump's 8% support was only a modest improvement on his 6% support from black voters in 2016.\n\nTrump's campaigning thus far\n\nSpeaking in Detroit over the weekend, Trump reiterated his prior criticisms of Biden's authorship of a 1994 crime bill while serving as a senator for Delaware. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act was a comprehensive overhaul of federal law enforcement, including funding for federal officers, an assault weapons ban, the expansion of the death penalty, and sentencing.\n\n\"Biden wrote the devastating 1994 crime bill, talking about 'super predators.' That was Biden. You know, he walks around now talking about the Black vote. He's the king of the 'super predators,'\" Trump said in Detroit .\n\nHe previously pointed to the legislation during the 2020 campaign, attempting to cast Biden as the architect of mass incarceration of black offenders, and to contrast that effort with his passage of the First Step Act, a criminal justice reform initiative that addressed mandatory minimum sentences.\n\nTrump's Detroit and upcoming Philadelphia events appear to be an attempt to build on existing momentum from his New York City-based campaign efforts while he stood trial. Earlier this year, Trump campaigned heavily within the Big Apple, visiting Harlem and later holding a rally in New Jersey .\n\n\"Black voters are also frustrated with the Biden administration prioritizing illegal immigrants over our interests and oppose Biden's policies on men in women's sports,\" Thomas added. \"President Trump sees this and will continue to show up and listen to the issues facing our communities, as he has done in Atlanta, Harlem, and the Bronx.\"\n\nHis appearance in Detroit saw him address issues of rising crime in major cities, saying \"[l]ook, the crime is most rampant right here and in African American communities.\"\n\n\"More people see me, and they say, 'Sir, we want protection. We want police to protect us. We don't want to get robbed and mugged and beat up or killed because we want to walk across the street to buy a loaf of bread,'\" he said, according to Fox News .\n\nWhat does the data say?\n\nTrump is largely making a similar pitch to black voters in 2024 that he did in the previous cycle, highlighting the economic and crime situation in their communities. This time, however, some data suggests that those voters may be more willing to listen.\n\nThe campaign on Monday highlighted a CNN clip showing Trump with 21% support among black voters rising to 21% from a 7% figure from 2020. That clip also pointed to a change in black voters under the age of 50, a group Biden won by 80 points in 2020 and is now leading by only 37 points.\n\n\"If this polling is anywhere near correct, we're looking at a historic moment right now where black voters under the age of 50, which have historically been such a big part of the Democratic coalition, are leaving it in droves,\" CNN's Harry Enten said.\n\nThe clip also showed analysis of a recent New York Times poll that found Biden leading Trump with black voters in battleground states 63% to 23%, though with the inclusion of third-party options, Biden led with 49% to Trump's 14% and independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy's 11%.\n\n\"It seems to me this is... partially an artifact of Donald Trump perhaps being better liked among black voters, but it's also a real artifact of Joe Biden being significantly less liked among black voters than he was four years ago,\" Enten concluded.\n\nA Pew Research Survey in April, meanwhile, showed Trump winning 18% of black voters to Biden's 77% in a one-on-one matchup. The evident expansion of Trump's appeal over the past four years with black voters appears to have been largely driven by younger members of that community.\n\nBlack voters aged 50 or older backed Biden 84% to Trump's 9%. Younger voters, however, backed Biden 68% to Trump's 29%. Black men were marginally more likely to back Trump than black women, with 20% of men doing so compared to 16% of women. Trump does appear to be earning support outside of black Republicans, however, as 12% of black voters identify with the GOP compared to 83% who identify with Democrats.\n\nThe former president's messaging, moreover, does seem to be somewhat in line with black voter priorities. Seventy-nine percent said that improving education ought to be a top priority, whereas 76% said strengthening the economy ought to be so. Seventy-four percent prioritized stabilizing Social Security, with 72% said the same of reducing the cost of health care, 70% said addressing the problems of the poor, and 68% emphasized reducing crime.\n\nMore localized data, moreover, does appear to show Trump poised to improve on his 8% showing, albeit in specific states. A USAToday /Suffolk University poll released over the weekend showed Trump with 10.8% of the black vote in Pennsylvania, compared to Biden's 56.2%.\n\nWhile Trump's support appears to be moderately higher than it was in the last election, Biden appears to be losing support to independents Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Cornell West, who earned 7.4% and 7.6% of that bloc, respectively. The numbers were worse for Biden in Michigan, where he earned 54.4% of black voter support, compared to Trump's 15.2%, Kennedy's 8%, and West's 6.2%.\n\nThat survey appeared to show the black communities in those states with relatively different priorities than the Pew survey, with both placing inflation/economy, threats to democracy, healthcare, abortion, crime and proxy wars, in their top issues. Notably, concern about crime in Pennsylvania was more than double that of Michigan, with 11.6% of black voters in the Keystone State prioritizing the issue compared to 5.2% in the Wolverine State.\n\nIs Trump gaining ground or is Biden losing it?\n\nWhile the above surveys do appear to show Trump gaining a modest amount of support within the black community and that Biden has lost appeal, many black voters appear more interested in third-party options.\n\nThe phenomenon does not appear unique to that bloc, however, as a recent survey of Latino voters in battleground states suggested that younger voters in that black were exploring third parties instead of looking to Trump.\n\n\"If you were to look at where Latinos are in battleground states, 59 percent of them are voting for Biden and 39 percent of them are voting for Trump,\" Voto Latino CEO María Teresa Kumar told The Hill this month. \"And our poll asked the thornier question, if we open up... including a third party, how does that poll?\"\n\n\"What we found was really alarming, in the sense that 14 percent of them would vote for a third party, with a majority of the votes being taken away from Biden,\" she went on. \"So instead of being at 59 percent, he dropped down to 49 percent. And Trump fell only 5 points.\"\n\nBen Whedon is an editor and reporter for Just the News. Follow him on X ."

But Harris's mixed record has different components of the political right seizing upon its disparate elements while the Trump campaign has pointed to her own \"weak-on-crime\" record.\n\nShe, meanwhile, has leaned into her record as a prosecutor to paint the race as that of a prosecutor against a convicted felon.\n\nBiden announced on Sunday that he had decided not to seek reelection and endorsed Harris to succeed him as the Democratic standard bearer. She has since received the endorsement of nearly every major party lawmaker and has reportedly secured enough delegates to clinch the nomination at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nThe Trump campaign initially focused its efforts on attempting to tie Harris to Biden's record in light of her place in the administration. To that end, Trump surrogates attempted to deem her \"Biden 2.0\" and quickly released an ad highlighting the situation at the southern border and current economic conditions, further claiming that \"Kamala owns this failed record.\"\n\nTrump himself, moreover, quickly moved toward painting Harris as a political radical far to the left of Biden, though he further attempted to cast her as power behind-the-scenes directing the Biden administration through its worst moments.\n\n\"Kamala Harris has been the ultra liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe. She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country,\" Trump said at a rally in Charlotte, N.C., earlier this week. \"Kamala Harris is the most liberal elected politician in American history.\"\n\nA \"Soros prosecutor\"\n\nPrior to her service as vice president, Harris was a senator from California, the state attorney general, and the San Francisco district attorney. Republicans appear poised to seize on her record and label her as a soft-on-crime prosecutor in the vein of the \"Soros-backed DA\" that Republicans have painted as among the leading causes of crime spikes.\n\nThe endorsement by Alex Soros for Harris this week is likely to cement the label in the minds of conservatives, who have already claimed she supported \"defunding the police\" and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n\"Kamala Harris is just as incompetent as Joe Biden and even more liberal. She was the tie-breaking vote in the Senate for Joe Biden's most disastrous policies,\" Trump Campaign National Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Just the News. \"Not only does Kamala need to defend her support of Joe Biden's failed agenda over the past four years, she also needs to answer for her own terrible weak-on-crime record in California.\"\n\n\"A vote for Kamala is a vote to allow illegal immigrants from all over the world to invade our country, a vote to defund the police, abolish ICE, and bail violent criminals out of jail,\" Leavitt went on.\n\nOther Trump surrogates, such as campaign communications director Steven Cheung deemed Harris \"soft as Charmin,\" in reference to her criminal justice policies and the toilet paper brand. He further asserted that she supported releasing \"anti-police rioters, rapists, and criminals,\" and that she supported defunding the police.\n\n\"Too tough on crime?\"\n\nOn the complete opposite end of the issue, Harris previously took flak from progressives during her own presidential campaign for being ostensibly too overzealous in her prosecutions.\n\nDuring the 2020 Democratic primary cycle, Harris faced attacks on her record as a prosecutor, with former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, claiming she \"put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she had ever smoked marijuana.\" Harris did oversee roughly 2,000 convictions related to marijuana while serving as California attorney general, but most of those did not serve jail time , according to Yahoo News.\n\nShe has further faced scrutiny over her handling of a Supreme Court mandate that the state reduce its prison population and allegations that she fought to keep prisoners incarcerated past their release dates for use as cheap labor.\n\nThe claims have some conservatives hoping to seize on the issue to win over support with minority communities. Conservative commentator Rob Smith , for instance this week, shared a \"Mosaic of Kamala Harris made up of photos of the Black men she locked up and kept in prison past their release date for free labor.\"\n\n\"She put a lot of Black men in jail for small stuff, small ball,\" Trump ally and Republican National Committee member Harmeet Dhillon told Politico this week.\n\nSuch criticisms seem to resemble Trump's attacks on President Joe Biden during the 2020 campaign cycle over his authorship of a 1994 crime bill that critics said led to large-scale incarcerations. But the right is far from united on that avenue of attack. Commentator Matt Walsh , for instance, suggested that such an approach was \"exactly the wrong move.\"\n\n\"It would be a disastrous and probably fatal error. Attacking Kamala FROM THE LEFT on crime, accusing her of locking up poor young innocent black men, would be political suicide,\" he added. \"This is exactly the kind of thing I'm worried about. It's exactly the sort of mistake Republicans love to make.\"\n\nHarris's response\n\nHarris, for her part, seems inclined to lean into her record as a prosecutor and to present herself as an aggressive prosecutor and to contrast her past employment with Trump's status as a convicted felon.\n\nThe former president was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's hush money case. He has, however, sought to have the conviction vacated in light of a Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity. But the conviction, nonetheless, has Harris linking Trump with an array of criminal offenders she previously faced in judicial proceedings.\n\n\"In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds - predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain,\" Harris said in Wisconsin this week, according to Politico . \"So, hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump's type.\"\n\nShe further intends to highlight the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot in a bid to paint Trump himself as a candidate of lawlessness and who has little respect for the American system, her aides told the outlet.\n\nFor her part, Harris has gone on the record as supporting \"defund the police\" arguments, and her tweets supporting \"The Freedom Fund\" to raise bail for those arrested in the George Floyd riots remain online.\n\nBen Whedon is an editor and reporter for Just the News.

      "text": "Trump releases pot prisoners jailed for life under Biden's 1994 crime bill\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday released seven prisoners with life sentences for marijuana - including some jailed without parole under President-elect Joe Biden's 1994 crime bill.\n\nParaplegic Michael Pelletier, 65, and Corvain Cooper, 41, are among the men who received prison commutations from Trump.\n\nPelletier had a life sentence for smuggling pot from Canada into Maine in the early 2000s. Both jurisdictions later legalized the drug.\n\nCooper had a life sentence for his role transporting marijuana from California to North Carolina, also under the three-strikes provision of Biden's law.\n\nThe crime bill's mandatory life sentence for a third serious drug conviction was reduced to 25 years by Trump's First Step Act , but the reduction wasn't retroactive. Cooper's initial two strikes were later thrown out, but that, too, didn't apply retroactively.\n\nCooper's attorney Patrick Michael Megaro told The Post in November that \"Biden is responsible for the 1994 crime law that [resulted in] Corvain Cooper being sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for marijuana and the Obama-Biden administration was directly responsible for the prosecution.\"\n\nMegaro told The Post on Wednesday that \"the system failed Corvain Cooper; Barack Obama's promises not to seek lengthy prison sentences for non-violent drug offenders and to grant clemency to those that were unjustly impacted proved to be hollow promises.\"\n\nPelletier, who was paralyzed as a child in a farm accident, told The Post in a recent email from prison that he endured a harrowing experience with COVID-19.\n\n\"I don't have much strength in my arms due to lack of physical therapy, so the prison staff hired another prisoner to push me around the compound. He died from COVID,\" Pelletier said.\n\n\"I also contracted COVID, but fortunately I survived, even though I have [type] 2 diabetes. My clemency petition was submitted during the Obama clemency project, but was never ruled on. It's still pending today and I honestly believe President Trump will be the man who will end this nightmare and reunite me with my family.\"\n\nPelletier's case was championed for years by Amy Povah, founder of the CAN-DO Foundation, which lobbies for clemency for lesser-known people.\n\nPovah said she is \"elated that [Pelletier's] sentence has finally been commuted.\"\n\n\"He served over 14 years and will be reunited with his brother, Dave Pelletier, numerous other siblings and family members,\" she said. \"Michael is an amazing artist who will continue to pursue his artistic expressions through several mediums, and he yearns to go fishing.\"\n\nAlso commuted was John Knock, 73, who was arrested in 1996 and ultimately jailed for life for his role in a smuggling ring moving marijuana through the US, Canada and Europe. Knock's sister Beth Curtis created the website LifeforPot.com to document life sentences for non-violent marijuana crimes.\n\nPresident Barack Obama denied Knock's clemency request in 2017.\n\nRecreational marijuana is legal under local law in 15 states, two US territories and Washington, DC, though it remains federally illegal. Biden opposes legalizing marijuana but Vice President-elect Kamala Harris supports legalization. The Biden administration is expected to tolerate state-legal pot businesses, as Trump did.\n\nTrump issued 73 pardons and 70 prison commutations early Wednesday. Rapper Lil Wayne , Death Row Records co-founder Michael \"Harry-O\" Harris and former White House strategist Steve Bannon were on the list. The lineup omitted more hotly debated names such as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and whistleblower Edward Snowden.\n\nThe other marijuana \"lifers\" being released are Ferrell Damon Scott, Anthony DeJohn, Craig Cesal and James Romans, according to the White House's clemency release.\n\nTrump also freed Oregon medical marijuana provider Brian Simmons from a 15-year sentence. California medical marijuana dealer Noah Kleinman was released six years into a 20-year sentence and Staten Island pot dealer Jonathon Braun was released five years into a 10-year sentence. Way Quoe Long, 58, was released halfway through a 50-year pot sentence.\n\nAdvertisement"

Critics say the tough-on-crime bill contributed to the mass incarceration of racial minorities in recent decades.\n\nBiden, growing testy, acknowledged that \"it's a legitimate concern, they should be skeptical.\" But he also said that while he's been \"told all along\" that young people oppose his past stances on criminal justice issues, \"there is no polling evidence to sustain that. Nor is there voting evidence thus far to sustain that.\"\n\n\"Watch what I do. Judge me based on what I do, what I say and to whom I say it,\" he said.\n\nBlack voters remain key to Democrats' chances for victory this fall, and Biden has engaged in a concerted outreach effort to the black community , releasing a plan focused on black economic mobility and racial disparities in health care and education systems earlier this year. He has also issued a criminal justice plan that reverses a number of key provisions of the crime bill and has apologized for supporting some policies in the 1990s that he now says were harmful.\n\nBut some black voters are still angered by his past stances on criminal justice issues and have questioned whether his proposed reforms go far enough.\n\nWhile there's little chance black voters will support President Donald Trump in significant numbers - 6% of black voters supported Trump in 2016, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of people who participated in its polls and were confirmed to have voted - there are concerns they may stay home, which could make the difference in a number of states key to Democrats' White House hopes.\n\nStill, Biden predicted Wednesday night that Democrats may be poised to take back control of the Senate this fall, if the current political climate continues.\n\n\"Based on the polling data now - it's really early - there is a real prospect that we'll pick up up to six seats in the United States to win back the Senate,\" he said.\n\nAs the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked nationwide protests and a renewed push for criminal justice and policing reform, Biden has spoken out more forcefully for the need to address systemic racism , and he reiterated his call for a number of police reforms first outlined in his criminal justice plan last summer.\n\nBut on Wednesday night, he still avoided a major flashpoint in the conversation around such reforms - whether he'd support reparations for black Americans. Pressed multiple times on his stance, Biden said only that a study should be done and that his support for cash reparations \"would depend on what it was and if it will include Native Americans as well.\""

      "text": "Joe Biden shouldn't apologize for fighting crime\n\nPresident Trump and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio agree: Joe Biden should be ashamed of his support for the 1994 crime bill.\n\nThe bipartisan legislation that was long a point of pride for President Bill Clinton - who signed it into law - is now in such malodor that CNN the other day identified it in a chyron as the \"infamous\" crime bill.\n\nTrump says that African-Americans won't vote for someone who supported the crime bill, which he calls a \"dark period in American history\" that Biden should apologize for.\" De Blasio, the no-hope presidential candidate, agrees, deeming the crime bill \"a painful era in our nation's history.\"\n\nBiden will have a lot of explaining to do about the bill, in the Democratic primaries and now, it's clear, even in a potential general election.\n\nThe legislation was a mixed bag - including an ineffectual assault-weapons ban and billions for supposed prevention - representing the blunderbuss approach typical of sweeping bipartisan federal legislation.\n\nBut the bill was, overall, a politically necessary response to a devastating ­decades-long crime wave. Rather than the foundational act of the American penal state, it is best viewed as part of a much larger, long-running effort to strengthen the criminal-justice system that helped drive down crime.\n\nIt is our good fortune to have forgotten the visceral fear and loathing engendered by the crime wave beginning in the 1960s. Violent crime increased 350 percent from 1960 to 1990. Criminologist Barry Latzer points out that from 1970 to 1995, almost 675,000 people were murdered in the United States; that's Civil War-level carnage.\n\nThe wave of murder began to break in the early 1990s, as the crack epidemic flamed out, but violent crime still increased significantly from 1987 to the early 1990s in big cities.\n\nCharles Lane of The Washington Post notes that 49 percent of people in 1994 said crime was the top problem in the country.\n\nThis wasn't a priority of white voters alone. The crime bill had the support of nearly 60 percent of non-whites, as well. Thirty-nine black pastors signed a letter supporting the legislation, and 10 black mayors urged the Congressional Black Caucus to back it, which most members did.\n\nThe bill's funding of more police officers probably helped, and the emphasis on greater incarceration certainly did, as well.\n\nIt's not true, as de Blasio says, that the \"crime bill was one of the foundations of mass incarceration.\"\n\nIncarceration began to increase in the 1970s as the crime wave built, and the crime bill most directly affected the federal system, accounting for less than 10 percent of all prisoners. See Also Bill de Blasio defends expansion of no-bail program for teen suspects in violent crimes\n\nThe bill had incentives for states to adopt so-called truth-in-sentencing laws, but a report by the Urban Institute found it only had a marginal effect.\n\nAccording to a study by the National Academy of Sciences, the drivers of mass incarceration were increases in prison commitments per arrest and in time served. Time served for murder went from five years in 1981 to 16.9 years in 2000, and for sexual assault from 3.4 years in 1981 to 6.6 years in 2009. Time served for aggravated assault, burglary and robbery all increased, as well.\n\nIt is true that the arrest rate for possession and use of drugs increased 162 percent from 1980 to 2006 (89 percent during the 1980s alone). We shouldn't exaggerate, though. At their height in 1990, drug offenders were about 20 percent of state prisoners and are currently less than 15 percent.\n\nOverall, the US incarceration rate is now at its lowest in 20 years.\n\nAlmost any public policy has its trade-offs, and in the fullness of time, with crime having fallen so dramatically, it is natural that the priorities - and overkill - of the 1990s will look different.\n\nBut no one should apologize for having worked to get dangerous people off the streets at a time when they were causing untold grief and rending the civic fabric of America.\n\nTwitter: @RichLowry"

      "text": "Bill Clinton's in trouble for telling the truth to Black Lives Matter\n\nBill Clinton trespassed against the cardinal rule of contemporary Democratic politics, which is: Thou shalt not contradict Black Lives Matter protesters.\n\nClinton's lapse came at a Philadelphia rally last week. When demonstrators inveighed against the 1994 crime bill signed by Clinton, the former president gave much better than he got. He rebutted them in finger-wagging detail, repeatedly returning to the point that the crime bill sought to diminish the rampant criminality that was destroying black lives.\n\nClinton thought he was winning the argument, and by any reasonable standard he was - but, politically, he committed a multitude of sins.\n\nHe defended the old term \"super predator\" as an accurate description of gang leaders who prey on kids - not realizing that the phrase has been deemed dehumanizing (gang leaders are very sensitive to such microaggressions).\n\nInstead of denouncing the police as agents of systemic racism, he defended sending more of them into the streets. And by using the phrase \"black lives\" in the context of blacks killing other blacks, he signaled he doesn't get that the only approved use of the slogan is as a bludgeon against the criminal justice system.\n\nIn short, Clinton demonstrated a commonsensical, pre-Black Lives Matter understanding of criminal justice, and quickly had to backtrack. Presumably, he won't be guilty of such an offense ever again.\n\nBoth Clinton and his critics exaggerate the effect of the 1994 crime bill, which, among other things, funded more cops and prisons. Clinton attributes the drastic decline in crime rates to it, when the drop had already begun. The critics attribute the drastic increase in incarceration to it, when that, too, preceded the bill.\n\nBut the notion that the crime bill and other tough-on-crime measures like it were part of a racist dragnet to imprison black men guilty of low-level drug offenses is obviously absurd.\n\nIt is easy to forget now, but between 1960 and 1990, the United States experienced perhaps the worst crime wave in its history. Violent crime increased more than 350 percent.\n\nAcross the 1960s, robbery rose 500 percent in cities with a population of 1 million. It would be impossible for the political system not to respond vigorously to such a tide of disorder, especially when the criminal justice system was initially so inadequate to the task.\n\nIn his book, \"The Rise and Fall of Violent Crime in America,\" Barry Latzer notes how the criminal justice system was fraying as crime spiked in the late 1960s: \"The number of arrests per reported crime went down, not up; sentencing to prison occurred less often, not more; and prison time served for serious crimes actually shortened, not lengthened.\"\n\nSubsequently, we readjusted, and it wasn't an exercise in quasi-white supremacy. From 1976 to 2005, blacks were 47 percent of murder victims. Bill Clinton's talk of kids wasn't just pulling at the heartstrings. During the crack epidemic in Washington, DC, about 500 kids were shot and stabbed in a roughly two-year period.\n\nSince their communities suffered so grievously from drug crime, black Democrats supported important legislative elements of the crackdown on drug offenses from the 1970s onward.\n\nYet the war on drugs wasn't the main driver of the remarkable 30-year rise in incarceration, from roughly 300,000 to more than 1.6 million. According to John Pfaff of Fordham Law School, less than 20 percent of the inmates in state prisons (they house most US prisoners) are there primarily on drug charges. The vast majority are guilty of violent or property offenses.\n\nThere is no doubt that policing and prisons - as well as the waning of the crack epidemic - played a role in breaking the great crime wave of the 1960s. That we are safer creates the political opening to rethink our incarceration policies.\n\nBill Clinton will now want to button his lip before saying such a thing, but it doesn't make it any less true.\n\nCheck out video of the incident here:"

      "text": "In ad blasting Biden for 1994 crime bill, Trump undermines law and order case\n\nA new Trump campaign commercial makes an engaging pitch for support from black Americans, but it repeats an attack against opponent Joe Biden that is flagrantly inaccurate and egregiously hypocritical.\n\nThe ad begins with an attractive black couple saying President Trump's tenure has been beneficial for their business. So far, so good. The ad pivots, though, to an attack on the 1994 crime bill that Biden helped negotiate while chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The claims in the ad are just plain false.\n\n\"Joe Biden wrote the crime bill,\" it says. (No, he didn't, but he did help oversee its legislative progress.) \"Hundreds of thousands of black Americans were put in jail for minor offenses.\" As those words cross the screen, the wife in the ad says that \"the one thing Joe Biden has done in 47 years in Washington, D.C., has made it difficult for black people.\"\n\nEvery element of that portion of the commercial is wrong. It makes the common but mistaken assumption that the 1994 bill cracked down hard on low-level drug-possession offenses and the like, and that blacks disproportionately suffered.\n\n\"The 1994 Crime Bill did not and is not driving so-called 'mass incarceration,'\" said Sean Kennedy, a visiting fellow specializing in criminal justice issues at the conservative Maryland Public Policy Institute. \"Most of that law's provisions applied to violent and sexual offenses at the federal level and did not impact federal drug offenses or state law ... More than 99.9% of drug-related offenders are sentenced for trafficking [significant drug dealing], not possession, and a quarter of them are foreigners running drug operations or smuggling narcotics.\"\n\nThe statistics overwhelmingly bear that out. Yes, federal incarceration has grown from 83,000 in 1995 to 182,000 today, but the vast bulk of the increase in federal incarceration has come for either weapons offenses, immigration-related crimes, white-collar crimes, sex crimes, or trafficking. In fact, of those 182,000 federal inmates today, a grand total of 247, barely more than a tenth of a single percent, are there for mere possession of illegal narcotics.\n\nAs for the advertisement's claim about black Americans being particularly harmed by the 1994 bill, that's just not true. While blacks still make up a significantly greater share of the prison population than of the U.S. population as a whole, the percentage of black inmates to total inmates has dropped substantially in the past 25 years. The percentage of white prisoners has increased, and that of Hispanics has jumped significantly. And, to whatever extent federal law even indirectly affects state imprisonment practices, the trend of combined federal and state imprisonment of blacks is downward as well. I don't have the following particular statistic from 1995 to 2000, but since the turn of the century , the imprisonment rate among black women has dropped 47% and that among black men has fallen by 22%.\n\nAgain, the reason these results don't match the ad's claims is that the bill itself wasn't even remotely aimed at low-level offenders. Its main provisions for federal criminal law increased penalties only for major crimes, while most of the rest of the bill provided funding, equipment, and training for better local, community-based policing. It defies not just statistics but logic to say that the bill imprisoned \"hundreds of thousands of black Americans ... for minor offenses.\"\n\nMoreover, while the bill was far from perfect, it was a huge success in its major aim, which was to catalyze a nationwide crackdown on violent crime. Perhaps other cultural trends aided the effects, but the simple fact is that the crime rate nationally began a precipitous decline just as the 1994 crime bill began being implemented. Whereas violent crime rates had risen 379% in three previous decades, those rates fell by nearly 50% in the ensuing decades.\n\nThat's why the Trump commercial is so hypocritical. For months, Trump has been running as the candidate who supposedly is a far tougher defender of law and order than the supposedly weak-on-crime Biden. Yet now, Trump's campaign blasts Biden for the one major piece of bipartisan crime legislation that Biden played a somewhat leading role in crafting - even though that law succeeded in cutting violent crime.\n\nSo, which is it, Mr. President: Was it good to be tough on crime like Biden and others were in 1994, to great results, or is cracking down on crime a bad thing because it means too many people get imprisoned?\n\nEither way, low-level offenders and blacks were neither targeted nor unduly punished. The ad, therefore, is poppycock."

The mistake came in terms of what the states did locally.\"\n\nBiden, describing the results of the legislation, pointed out disparities in sentencing between black and white men.\n\n\"So, we set up a sentencing commission, we didn't set the time, every single solitary maximum was reduced in there. But what happened was, it became the same time for the same crime. So it said you have to serve between one and three years - it ended up becoming much lower. Black folks went to jail a lot less than they would have before, but it was a mistake,\" he said.\n\nThroughout his presidential campaign, Biden supported his record on the crime bill, denying allegations from left-wing critics that it contributed to mass incarceration . In an interview with The Breakfast Club over the summer, he said failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was wrong for her and her husband's involvement in the bill.\n\n\"She was wrong. What happened was - that wasn't the crime bill, it was the drug legislation. It was their institution of mandatory minimums, which I opposed,\" Biden said . In the same interview, he said black voters \"ain't black\" if they chose to vote for President Trump over him.\n\nAt the time of the bill's passage, a supermajority of the Congressional Black Caucus also backed the bill. However, Biden has expressed regret for certain components of the bill. In January 2019, Biden said stronger sentences for crack cocaine possession required by the bill were a \"mistake.\"\n\n\"It was a big mistake that was made,\" he said then . \"We were told by the experts that 'with crack, you can never go back.'\" Biden later noted that component of the bill \"trapped an entire generation.\""

      "text": "Biden quashes 1994 crime bill with campaign criminal justice reform proposal\n\nF ormer Vice President Joe Biden rolled out a criminal justice reform plan Tuesday, offering several proposals that distance him from the 1994 crime bill he sponsored .\n\nWhen the then-Senate Judiciary Committee chairman pushed the bill, signed by President Bill Clinton, the crack-cocaine epidemic was rampant. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle sought to fix the issue by passing tough-on-crime provisions to alleviate the matter. This included strict sentencing measures on drug-related crimes.\n\nPresently, not only does Biden want to abolish the federal death penalty, he also wants to eradicate mandatory minimums, end the federal crack and powder cocaine disparity, decriminalize the use of cannabis and automatically expunge all prior cannabis use convictions, cease all incarceration for drug use alone, and divert individuals to drug courts and treatment instead.\n\nFraternal Order of Police President Chuck Canterbury told the Washington Examiner Tuesday he has not come to any conclusion on Biden's proposal, but he did note that the crack cocaine disparities \"were dealt with years ago in sentencing reform\" legislation on Capitol Hill. Also, the FOP has a standing motion that the organization does not support the legalization of cannabis.\n\nAdditionally, Biden wants to use the president's clemency power to secure the release of individuals facing unduly long sentences for certain nonviolent and drug crimes. The campaign argues this will lower federal spending on incarceration and any extra money saved should be \"reinvested in the communities impacted by mass incarceration.\"\n\n\"[Each case] will have to be looked at individually because what some people call violent crime other people don't. They need to be much better defined. You got to take into consideration plea bargains, where somebody is convicted or charged with a violent felony and they plea down to a lesser included charge - still a violent felon. So you have to be very careful with that,\" Canterbury said.\n\nThe former vice president seeks to create a $20 billion competitive grant program to urge states, cities, and local municipalities to implement his criminal justice reform-related initiatives.\n\nHis new proposal, according to his campaign, is \"inspired\" by the Brennan Center, and as a requirement to receive the funding, states would have to abolish mandatory minimums for nonviolent crimes, institute earned credit programs, and take other steps to reduce incarceration rates without impacting public safety.\n\nThe Biden initiative would also federally fund pre-kindergarten to every three- and four-year old in the country by tripling funding for Title I. The campaign claims, \"This will eliminate the funding gap between white and non-white districts, and rich and poor districts. Biden will also make sure every high school student graduates with either advanced credits or an industry credential in their pocket. And, he'll make community college free for all qualified students.\"\n\nBiden will make a formal announcement of his plan in New Orleans Tuesday afternoon."

It may happen tomorrow. You've got a bill which has some bad stuff in it, some good stuff.

The legislation caused political problems during the 2016 presidential campaign for Hillary Clinton, given many pundits argue the framework had a disproportionate impact on communities of color.

But if Trump comes out strong on criminal justice reform, he is going to get a slice of the black vote, because this is life or death,\" West said. \"I think Biden is going to have to take responsibility and acknowledge the contribution he made to something that was not a force for good. We all make mistakes, but this was a major, major bad judgment. And we have to tell the truth.\n\n\"That Joe Biden was one of the architects, or core architects, is going to haunt him in a very serious way,\" West said. \"When he says it didn't contribute to mass incarceration, I tell him he has to get off his symbolic crack pipe.\"\n\nThe 1994 law introduced mandatory life sentences for three-time federal felons and had a ripple effect of increasing state prison populations by granting $12.5 billion for prison construction to states that passed \"truth-in-sentencing\" laws forcing inmates to serve 85% of sentences.\n\nIn his Twitter assault, Trump wrote that the First Step Act he signed in December - lessening the three-strikes penalty to 25 years, among other reductions - \"helped fix the bad 1994 Bill\" and noted that then-first lady Hillary Clinton used the term \"super predator\" to describe black youth targeted by the measure.\n\n\"Super Predator was the term associated with the 1994 Crime Bill that Sleepy Joe Biden was so heavily involved in passing. That was a dark period in American History, but has Sleepy Joe apologized? No!\" Trump wrote.\n\nWest largely agreed with Trump's attack on Biden and expressed concern about the former vice president fracturing the Democratic base ahead of 2020. West, who supports Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders over Biden, said that large numbers of black voters and progressives would sit out the election if Biden were unrepentant as the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"It is our relatives and friends and children who were damaged by this,\" West said of the crime bill, explaining why African Americans would abandon Biden. \"I think it damaged sister Hillary also\" in 2016\n\nWest said Biden \"should be ashamed of himself\" for using the word \"predator\" in a 1993 speech pushing for the legislation, and that Trump has a clear political opening.\n\nWest said Biden will cause many liberal voters, as well as black voters, to abandon him if he does not apologize for the 1994 law. Sanders also voted for the bill but said in March he was swayed by the inclusion of an assault weapons ban and provisions penalizing violence against women.\n\nWest said \"we got to do everything we can to get brother Trump out of the White House,\" suggesting with a laugh, \"My fundamental advice to Biden is pull out of the race and pull into the port of Bernie.\"\n\nAnyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected.

From a spiritual perspective for his own soul he needs to repent,\" King said.\n\n\"Enough people do not know [about the law], and when they do find out they definitely care,\" she said. \"I believe an enlightened, compassionate America will vote for those who want to set the captives free.\"\n\n....Super Predator was the term associated with the 1994 Crime Bill that Sleepy Joe Biden was so heavily involved in passing.

      "text": "Sorry #BlackLivesMatter: Black leaders supported Clinton's '94 crime bill\n\nBlack Lives Matter is in an all-out war against Bill Clinton and his legacy, especially the 1994 crime bill. It may seem opportunistic for young #BlackLivesMatter activists to accuse the former president of racism, but some of the biggest supporters of the law were leaders in the African American community.\n\nNBC News reported that The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 may have contained some harsh aspects, including expanding the death penalty to include drug offenses, the \"Three Strikes, You're Out\" rule, and billions in funding for state police and prisons in exchange for policies that made it harder for people to get parole. However, the bill was overwhelmingly supported by black leaders who saw their communities consumed by crime.\n\nIt's hard to understand in today's world, but the nation was actually much more dangerous two decades ago. New York City alone experienced nearly 2,000 murders, over 3,000 rapes, and 100,000 burglaries in 1993. That seems almost incomprehensible today - in 2015 NYC saw just 352 homicides, 1,438 rapes, and 15,125 burglaries.\n\nNew York City Rep. Charles Rangel (D) saw this crime affecting his district in Harlem and was one of the first people to push for tougher enforcement in the \"War on Drugs\" with President Nixon.\n\nHe was one of the largest supporters of Nancy Reagan's \"Just Say No\" campaign and the escalation of the \"War on Drugs\" during President Reagan's administration.\n\nWhile Rangel didn't end up supporting Clinton's '94 law, plenty of other black politicians did. The first black mayor of Baltimore Kurt Schmoke supported it, as did Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.), the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus who rallied most of his members to support the legislation.\n\nIn the end, a majority of the bill's supporters were Democrats, 188 voted aye vs. just 46 Republicans.\n\nBlack leaders were desperate to rid the inner cities of the crime that was killing thousands of young black men every year.\n\nThough the law had unintended consequences, violent crime in America did drop drastically over the next two decades.\n\nDespite claims that black voters were outraged by Clinton and the Democratic Party's betrayal, they had a funny way of showing it. In 1996, the former president captured 84 percent of the African American vote, and his Vice President Al Gore received 90 percent of the African American vote in 2000.\n\nIf black millennials really want to show the Clintons that they disapprove of their legacy, they can vote Republican or third party in this year's election."

      "text": "On the crime bill, Biden is groveling when he should be boasting\n\nDemocrats have moved so far leftward that now Joe Biden is apologizing for a 1994 crime bill that, yes, actually cut crime.\n\nNow the media is fact-checking Biden's apology - a fate Biden could have avoided if he had done the right thing by bragging about the bill's successes.\n\nWell-intentioned people across the political spectrum have worked in recent years to reduce the incidence of over-incarceration. The reform idea du jour is that nonviolent offenders should spend less time behind bars and more in rehabilitative environments. It's a good idea. The Left, though, absurdly takes the idea further, arguing in effect that prisoners are somehow victims and that even repeat offenders should serve substantially less time.\n\nHence Biden's convoluted groveling. Even though he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee that largely produced the final version of the 1994 federal crime bill, he is now saying the bill really wasn't his responsibility. He's also saying the bill didn't really increase incarceration all that much, and that to the extent it did, it was then-President Bill Clinton's fault.\n\nSo, to review: It wasn't his fault, but it didn't do what they say it did, but when it did the allegedly bad things they say it did, well, remember, it wasn't his fault.\n\nYeah, right.\n\nBiden's pretzel-like explanations aside, here's the reality: The 1994 crime bill contained some unnecessary measures, but to the extent that it did result in increased incarceration, its result was exactly as intended, which was to reduce violent crime both directly in the federal system and also, indirectly, by spurring states to crack down on violent offenders.\n\nThere were four key provisions relating to new and necessary incarceration. First, the law provided funds for states to hire more police. Second, it helped states finance more prison space. Third, it encouraged states to make violent offenders serve 85% of their sentences. Fourth, it enacted a \"three strikes\" provision, for federal crimes only, that mandated life imprisonment for a violent offense that followed two earlier convictions, state or federal, for violent felonies.\n\nThe three-strikes provision now has a bad odor, because too many states enacted copycat measures that included nonviolent , lower-level offenses. But the federal provision was well targeted at violent recidivists. I know because I helped write it.\n\nIn a 1993 referendum, Washington State adopted a well-designed three-strikes law. My then-boss, U.S. Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., was a former local, state, and federal prosecutor. For two years already, he had been pushing a federal three-strikes bill. The very day after the Washington referendum overwhelmingly passed, he entered the office and directed us to re-tweak and re-introduce his own federal bill, carefully aimed only at violent recidivists. As his press aide, I quickly saw via talk radio and newspaper columns how much support grew, indeed erupted, when word of our bill got out.\n\nLivingston introduced the bill , which quickly earned huge bipartisan support in the House. But then New York Democrat Chuck Schumer, still a House member while the Democrats had the majority, insisted that the House Judiciary Committee wouldn't advance the bill unless he was listed as its original co-author.\n\nSeeing the growing popularity of tough-on-crime measures, Clinton suddenly wanted a larger bill of his own. With Biden as point man in the Senate, that more comprehensive bill, incorporating the Livingston-Schumer three-strikes proposal along with numerous other measures, passed easily into law.\n\nAnd it worked.\n\nRates of violent crime in the United States had risen from 158.1 per 100,000 people in 1961 to 758.2 per 100,000 in 1991 - an astonishing 379% increase in just three decades. After the federal crime bill, plus the adoption nationwide of smart policing practices embraced by, among others, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, violent crime rates began dropping precipitously. By 2011, the rate per 100,000 was down to 387.1 - in other words, nearly cut in half.\n\nThe decline in violent crime coincided exactly with the rise of tough-on-crime policies. Part of getting tough on crime involves putting violent offenders in prison. If they aren't on the streets, they can't rob, rape, and murder. It's that simple.\n\nThus, a large part of the rise in incarceration rates was necessary. One can and should argue for alternative sentencing, less incarceration, and more rehabilitation for one-time or nonviolent offenders, yet still fight hard to keep violent recidivists behind bars.\n\nBiden is right that if states went overboard in incarcerating, rather than requiring community service for, nonviolent offenders, it wasn't the 1994 federal crime bill that did it. But to the extent that that bill did increase incarceration, it did so wisely and well. Joe Biden should be proud: He helped package Bob Livingston's idea in a way effective at keeping American communities safer."

      "text": "Biden Leaves Office With Mixed Reactions To His Legacy\n\nPresident Joe Biden took office amid one of the most sweeping public health crises in the nation's history, promising to \"restore the soul\" of the country and bring unity. As his term comes to an end, his presidency has been met with a mix of praise and criticism, leaving behind a divided legacy.\n\nIn his inaugural address in 2021, Biden described the moment as a \"winter of peril and possibility.\" Four years later, in his farewell speech to the nation on Jan. 15, he expressed pride in his administration's achievements.\n\n\"I've kept my commitment to be president for all Americans through one of the toughest periods in our nation's history,\" Biden said, reflecting on the successes and challenges of his tenure.\n\nSome regarded the president a hero, arriving just in time to navigate the country through the COVID-19 pandemic, mandate vaccines, fix supply chains, spur economic growth, and defend democracy.\n\nYet, as Emel Akan writes for The Epoch Times , for others, his presidency became a source of frustration due to concerns about government overspending, soaring inflation, escalating wars, and a deepening border crisis.\n\nOne of the defining issues of Biden's presidency was inflation, which hit a 40-year high during his term. Rising grocery and energy costs strained the daily lives of many Americans, especially those in the lower and middle classes, whom Biden had pledged to support.\n\nThough Biden and his administration argued that inflation was a global phenomenon caused by the pandemic and Russia's war in Ukraine, rising costs played a significant role in fueling negative perceptions of his economic agenda, known as \"Bidenomics.\"\n\nA grocery store in Columbia, Md., on Oct. 24, 2024. Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times\n\nThe 82-year-old president leaves office believing he has achieved significant wins for the country. But his approval ratings remained persistently low throughout much of his term.\n\nAccording to a recent CNN poll , 36 percent of U.S. adults at the end of his presidency approve of how Biden managed the country. It was also the lowest rating of his term.\n\nHe received especially low approval ratings on his handling of immigration, foreign affairs, and the economy. However, his approval was relatively higher in other areas, such as protecting democracy, and handling environmental and health care policies.\n\nA recent Gallup survey also found that 54 percent of U.S. adults believe Biden will be remembered as a \"poor\" or \"below average\" president.\n\nSome Democrats, however, say Biden was not fully appreciated during his time in office, arguing that history will eventually give him more credit than the current polls suggest.\n\nAccording to Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.), it's important to remember the context in which Biden took office.\n\n\"If you look back to four years ago, we faced mass unemployment, and in January 2021, we were right in the middle of the worst and deadliest month of the COVID pandemic. The economy was on its knees,\" Boyle told The Epoch Times.\n\n\"He leaves office four years later with the strongest economy in the world,\" he said. \"On foreign affairs, he rebuilt our NATO alliance. We were able to stand up to Russian aggression in Ukraine. So overall, while there are still things that we need to improve, America is much stronger and economically more prosperous today than when he entered office four years ago.\"\n\nMany will view Biden's presidency as a period of significant legislative achievements, particularly in areas such as infrastructure and manufacturing. As part of his \"Investing in America\" agenda, the president directed nearly $221 billion in federal funds during his term-through loans, grants, tax credits, and other incentives-into boosting domestic manufacturing. According to the White House, these incentives unlocked more than $1 trillion in private-sector investment across industries such as semiconductors, solar energy, batteries, critical minerals, and nuclear energy.\n\nWorkers install solar panels on a rooftop at the Port of Los Angeles, in Los Angeles on April 21, 2023. Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\nBiden said he created jobs every single month during his presidency, claiming to have achieved the lowest average unemployment rate of any administration in the last 50 years.\n\n\"We changed the basic formula of how to make an economy work,\" Biden said in his final sit-down interview with MSNBC on Jan. 17, highlighting how his administration had empowered labor unions.\n\n\"He's been a good president. He's delivered on a lot,\" Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) told The Epoch Times.\n\nThe outgoing president repeatedly said many of his legislative achievements are focused on the long term, arguing that their positive effects will become more evident over time.\n\nIn a recent interview with USA Today , Biden also expressed regret for not taking enough credit for these accomplishments, admitting that he could have done more to communicate what he had delivered for the American people.\n\nBiden was reluctant to engage with the media during his time in office. A July study found that he held fewer press conferences and gave fewer media interviews than any president since Ronald Reagan.\n\nAs the oldest president in U.S. history, Biden faced frequent questions about his age and mental fitness. Many believed he was not fit to run for a second term. After a poor debate performance in June, he faced mounting pressure and eventually announced that he was stepping aside as the party's presidential nominee, and passed the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBiden recently said he believed he could have won the 2024 presidential election if he had stayed in the race. However, he told USA Today that he wasn't sure he had the energy to serve another four years in office.\n\n\"Who knows what I'm going to be when I'm 86 years old?\" he said.\n\nDemocrat strategist Theryn Bond defines Biden's time in office in two words-\"consequential and controversial.\"\n\n\"There were a number of things over the course of his entire political career that many may have viewed as problematic, while others may have viewed as wildly successful,\" she told The Epoch Times.\n\nBond believes that Biden came to office like a \"superhero\" because people were unhappy with President Donald Trump's COVID-19 response and other policy decisions four years ago and assumed Biden would \"save the day.\"\n\nBond also pointed out that he will be judged not just for his presidency but for the actions he's taken throughout his entire political career.\n\nSome will praise him for the programs and initiatives he introduced that benefited them directly, she said, such as student loan forgiveness.\n\n\"People also know him as 'Crime Bill Joe,' a legacy that left a sour taste in many folks' mouths for decades,\" she added, referring to the 1994 Crime Bill and its controversial impact , particularly on communities of color.\n\nIn the final weeks of his presidency, Biden faced backlash for pardoning his son, Hunter, who was facing sentencing in two criminal cases, despite previously ruling out such action. His decision drew sharp criticism, even from within his party, with many accusing him of setting an unusual precedent for future presidents.\n\nJoe Biden, Hunter Biden, and Beau Jr., in Nantucket, Mass., on Nov. 29, 2024. Craig Hudson/Reuters\n\nThroughout his presidency, Biden said he worked to strengthen alliances and partnerships, particularly to counter Russia and China. He took pride in bolstering NATO by welcoming new members, Sweden and Finland, into the alliance.\n\nThe outgoing commander-in-chief emphasized that, despite challenges, he kept America out of war.\n\nHowever, his foreign policy faced significant scrutiny, especially because of the chaotic withdrawal of the U.S. military from Afghanistan in 2021. The fall of Kabul to the Taliban after the U.S. pullout, along with the tragic killing of 13 U.S. troops in a suicide bombing at the Kabul airport, led to widespread criticism of the administration's handling of the crisis. The images of desperate Afghans clinging to planes to escape the country shocked the world, and many U.S. allies questioned America's leadership on the world stage.\n\nDuring his foreign policy speech at the State Department on Jan. 13, Biden took credit for the Afghanistan withdrawal, stating that he ended the nation's longest war after 20 years of fighting.\n\nHowever, the incident marked a turning point in his presidency, leading to the first significant decline in his approval ratings.\n\nPassengers board a U.S. Air Force C-17 at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, on Aug. 24, 2021.

However, Biden's approach furthered efforts focused on strengthening alliances in the Indo-Pacific region to address climate change and technology, while also working to limit China's access to critical American technologies.\n\nBiden also called Chinese communist party leader Xi Jinping a dictator and declared that the United States would not hesitate to use military force if China attempted to invade Taiwan.\n\nDuring his farewell address from the Oval Office on Jan. 15, Biden said \"an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power, and influence.\"\n\nHe also echoed President Dwight Eisenhower's famous 1961 farewell address that warned of the dangers of the \"military-industrial complex.\"\n\n\"Six decades later, I'm equally concerned about the potential rise of a tech-industrial complex that could pose real dangers for our country,\" Biden said.\n\nMany believed that Biden's comments were aimed at billionaire Elon Musk, owner of social media platform X, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the latter of whom recently reformed Meta's fact-checking program to be more like the X-style community notes, calling third-party fact checkers \"too politically biased.\"\n\nIn a recent interview with Joe Rogan, Zuckerberg said that during the COVID-19 pandemic, officials in the Biden administration pushed to censor vaccine-related content.\n\n\"We did generally defer to the government on some of these policies that in retrospect I probably wouldn't, knowing what I know now,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nChristopher Hale, a political commentator and former Obama White House and campaign alum, said Biden's farewell address wasn't crafted to win the immediate moment.\n\n\"It was designed to shape the broader, enduring argument,\" Hale told The Epoch Times.\n\n\"If his diagnosis of a tech-industrial oligarchy as the defining threat of our era proves correct, this could become the pivotal moment of his presidency. However, it will take a generation to fully judge its significance.\"\n\nMeta Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee in Washington on Jan. 31, 2024. Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times\n\nBiden is visiting Charleston, South Carolina, on Sunday, just one day before leaving office-a state where his journey to the White House began more than four years ago. South Carolina holds particular significance for Biden, as he won the state's primary in 2020 thanks to strong support from its black voters. This victory was a pivotal moment that helped his campaign regain momentum and eventually secure the party's presidential nomination after struggling in earlier primaries.\n\nThe end of Biden's presidency also marks the conclusion of his political career, which has spanned five decades and included roles as a senator from Delaware and as vice president under President Barack Obama.\n\nOn Jan. 20, Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will attend Trump's inauguration. Following the swearing-in ceremony, the Bidens will reportedly travel to central California for some personal time.\n\nThe outgoing president indicated on Jan. 10 that he will continue to work on domestic policy matters after leaving office.\n\nWhen asked about his plans, Biden told reporters jokingly, \"I'm not going to be out of sight or out of mind.\"\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "VIDEO: MSNBC Hack Pushes Armed Insurrection to Prevent Trump Presidency\n\nOriginally published via Armageddon Prose :\n\nEveryone's favorite pseudo-populist retarded Cajun gargoyle - \"everyone\" being the Deep State managers who run MSNBC and seemingly have him on every other day to offer anachronistic and frequently empirically wrong political opinions - appeared yesterday to call for, on national television, armed insurrection in the event Trump defeats the Karamel-uh entity in two weeks.\n\nRelated: MSNBC News Actress Confronted Over Migrant Coverage, Bodyguard Assaults Journalist\n\nCarville is concerned as well about what Donald Trump will do to the MOCs (Males of Color) once he assumes office - because, apparently, his former boss who signed the 1994 Crime Bill and put nonviolent drug offenders in prison for life and his wife who called black children \"super-predators\" who need to be \"brought to heel\" were so good to them... or something.\n\nWhatever - just get back on the Democrat plantation, MOCs! Masta's on the ballot!\n\nVia Slay News (emphasis added):\n\n\"Veteran Democrat strategist James Carville has appeared on national television and warned the American people President Donald Trump is planning to arrest all \"males of color\" if he wins the election.\n\nIn addition, Carville , who served as the lead strategist on Bill Clinton's winning 1992 presidential campaign, called for leftists to launch an armed uprising if Trump beats Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris .\n\nThe former Clinton strategist also pushed the false claim that Trump has publicly stated he will \"use the military to arrest political enemies\" and wants \"to get rid of the Constitution.\"...\n\n\"People want to know about [Harris' polling] weakness among males of color,\" Carville said.\n\n\"Okay? He's gonna arrest all of ya,\" he claimed...\n\nThe Democrat operative then compared the current political environment to pre-WWII and pre-Civil War times.\n\n\" When the Republic was threatened, people picked up arms and answered the call,\" Carville said .\n\n\"Or, you know, in 1965 in the middle of the Civil Rights movement, I think people decided they were gonna take matters into their own hands and create a better country and that's what I hope we do here in the next few weeks ,\" he finished.\"\n\nIt sounds an awful lot to me like what is happening here is James begging publicly for Trump to give him the nonviolent J6 granny \"domestic terrorist\" treatment.\n\nI myself am more partial to the guillotine for creatures such as him (following all due process granted to the defendant, obviously; we don't promote vigilante justice), but if we must conduct ourselves in a civilized 21 st -century manner, the DC gulag is the next best thing for him.\n\nRelated: EXCLUSIVE: Nonviolent 'J6 Granny' Slapped With Bitter Sentence\n\nThis brand of election-denial rhetoric has become commonplace on the left over the course of the last year as the Deep State has seen its lawfare, character assassination attempts, literal assassination attempts, etc. fail to produce the desired results.\n\nJamie Raskin, earlier this year, floated nullifying the election results via the 14 th Amendment, which according to his own logic would create \"civil war conditions\" in America and then require instituting martial law to quell the uprising.\n\nVia The Federalist (emphasis added):\n\n\" If you listen to U.S. Rep.

      "text": "The Long Sordid Career Of Creepy Joe Biden\n\nAuthored by Donald Jeffries via substack,\n\nI get complaints from people that I concentrate too much on Donald Trump. Basically, the message is, \"But what about Biden?\" I do write more about Trump, because he's the face of the perceived opposition. The only Emmanuel Goldstein in town. I assume everyone reading me understands just who and what Joe Biden is.\n\nBut people might not remember quite everything about Joe Biden's lengthy career as a beloved resident of the Washington, D.C. swamp that Trump promised to drain. Biden was first elected as a U.S. Senator from Delaware in 1973. Even I was very young then. In 1981, the great \"liberal\" senator strongly supported the Intelligence Identities Protection Act, passed in the wake of CIA whistleblower Philip Agee's disclosures about the Agency is his best-selling book Inside the Company. Biden declared that \"I do not think anybody has any doubt about Mr. Agee. We should lock him away in my opinion.\" The good senator really liked locking people up, it seems. As a strong supporter of the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, he took credit for a draconian provision that mandated a five year sentence for possessing small amounts of crack cocaine.\n\nLittle did Biden know that, decades later his own troubled son Hunter would be caught with enough crack cocaine to garner a long prison sentence under the original 1986 Act, which was softened a bit in 2010. With every ounce of \"liberal\" ardor that he could muster, Biden bragged at the time, \"If you have a piece of crack cocaine no bigger than this quarter that I'm holding in my hand, one quarter of one dollar, we passed a law - with leadership of Sen. Thurmond and myself and others - a law that says: you're caught with that, you go to jail for five years. You get no probation, you get nothing, other than five years in jail. Judge doesn't have a choice.\" Senator Biden also authored the horrendous 1994 crime bill which featured \"three strike you're out\" and mandatory sentencing, significantly increasing the prison population.\n\nA JFK assassination researcher attended a Joe Biden seminar in 2005. He was able to briefly question Biden about the assassination. As recounted on a discussion forum, this was the short conversation: \"Senator Biden, do you believe JFK was killed as a result of a conspiracy?\" Answer:  \"No.\" \"So do you believe that Lee Harvey Oswald, alone and unaided, killed President Kennedy?\" Answer:  \"Yes.\" This is hardly surprising, of course, but reflects Biden's ironclad establishment mindset. In 2019, the American Prospect published a piece headlined, \"Joe Biden's Love Affair With the CIA.\" Biden was very helpful to Reagan's CIA Director William Casey, who praised him in a classified early 1980s memo to his intelligence staff. Biden would state, in a speech at Stanford, that the intelligence community had been compromised by leaks.\n\nSo Joe Biden was never one of the Democratic Party politicians I admired back in my misguided youth. He wasn't going to expose the abuses of the intelligence agencies, like a Frank Church. He wasn't interested in any \"sunshine\" laws that would make it easier for the People to be informed about their government. His concern then about \"leaks\" would evolve into concern over whistleblowers like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange. In a January, 2023 tweet, Snowden would comment on Biden's classified documents scandal, accusing the Department of Justice of suppressing the story until after the election, and declared, \"Worth noting that the President seems to have absconded with more classified documents than many whistleblowers.\" Biden is on the record as saying that Snowden should \"face the consequences of his actions.\"\n\nFollowing Julian Assange's release from exile last week, some assumed that the Biden administration had been responsible for it, given Biden's recent statements that he was \"considering\" dropping the charges against the Wikileaks founder. However, the White House would issue a statement maintaining that they had not played a role in Assange's plea deal. A deal which, incidentally, made the disappearance of all those troubling DNC emails a prerequisite for his release. So if you're tempted to think that perhaps, after over fifty years of serving the interests of the corrupt Deep State, Joe Biden finally did something good, you'd be wrong. Why spoil a perfect record? Even Barack Obama commuted Bradley/Chelsea Manning's sentence.\n\nSo we get to the Joe Biden we've come to know and love.\n\nApparently beset with relatively early dementia, he has bumbled, mumbled, and stumbled his way through an embarrassing series of verbal and physical gaffes. He has also avoided being held accountable for some pretty blatant criminality. As far back as when Hunter and his late brother Beau were little boys, Daddy Joe had a disturbing habit of \"crashing\" into vacant mansions that were on the market. They literally sometimes entered through unlocked windows. As a long time realtor, I can tell you that it's pretty simple to make a call and schedule an appointment to see a property, especially a vacant one. It is unknown why the then United States Senator engaged in such bizarre behavior, but it speaks to some kind of odd personality flaw.\n\nHunter wasn't the only Biden offspring to become addicted to the drugs the young senator wanted to crack down on (pun intended). Biden's daughter Ashley wrote openly about the \"inappropriate\" showers her father took with her when she was a young girl in her journal. This triggered an unfortunate promiscuity in her, as well as an addiction to illegal drugs. We only know about this journal, because Ashley left it behind at a drug rehab center, and the woman who found it sold it to Truth Veritas. Being as we are living in America 2.0, and not some vaunted \"democracy,\" the woman was prosecuted and served thirty days in jail. Joe Biden remains unscathed by what should be a very serious scandal. It's not like he bounced his daughter on his knee, like Donald Trump and every other father has.\n\nLeft free to his own devices, Creepy Joe resumed his long history of inappropriately touching little girls, much of it documented on videotape. Our beloved president has a rarely known perverse kink for sniffing their hair. Again, this is all clearly shown on film. If only the Washington Generals were an actual opposition party, they might want to use those damning film clips in their campaign ads. I don't know what kind of evidence existed against any pedophiles who were given long prison sentences, but how much more incriminating can you get than an adult grabbing the undeveloped chests of minor girls, while their facial expressions register their discomfort? Sure, there is supposedly the filmed rape of a ten year old girl by Hunter Biden on his laptop, but that's been sent down the memory hole along with those DNC emails.\n\nMen have been prosecuted and given lengthy prison sentences for less clear evidence of child abuse than what can be seen freely online, in numerous past instances, from our current president. Either this is the heinous crime most of us think it is, or it's no big deal. So release all the pedophiles. Unless you have video of them actually raping children. Like the alleged rape of a child on Hunter Biden's laptop. Or the still never seen videos of our glorious troops raping Iraqi boys while their mothers scream. Seymour Hersh claims to have seen them. Some pedophiles are more equal than others. Just keep repeating, \"grab 'em by the pussy\" and click your heels three times. Creepy Joe's rather sensual kissing of his own granddaughter was also notable. Maybe he forgot it was his granddaughter. Or he was hoping to shower with her.\n\nBiden was caught, again, on videotape , boasting about getting a Ukrainian prosecutor fired. Who was looking into his son's (and his) financial improprieties in that wonderful democracy presided over by a former actor, who has a legendary proficiency for penis piano playing. That's pretty damning evidence. But no, it was Donald Trump instead, who was impeached because of a \"perfect\" telephone conversation to the very same crisis actor/comedian Volodymyr Zelenskyy. For asking the astute pianist to look into any possible corruption by the Bidens. I think there's an obvious message there. But that's what happens when you play for the Washington Generals. It's a Harlem Globetrotters thing, you wouldn't understand.\n\nI have written many articles over the years for the American Free Press, detailing Hunter Biden's financial shenanigans in Ukraine. They are intermingled with the \"Big Guy,\" the same timeless statesman who has sniffed more girlish hair than any other political leader in the history of the formerly free world. Hunter Biden's emails reveal that the \"Big Guy\"- his loving father- always got a cut of the booty, no matter what. Just like court historian hero William Sherman, who always got a cut of all the personal property his Union troops stole from southern civilians. As my new book American Memory Hole will show, this theft is a grand American tradition going back at least to the Mexican-American War. The Bidens obviously know their history.\n\nJoe Biden, when he has been comprehensible, has said some remarkable things during his terrifying presidency. How many times has he claimed that \"White Supremacy\" represents \"the greatest danger to democracy?\" Now, keep in mind this is the corrupt elite's definition of democracy, not any form of government the ancient Greeks would recognize. That speech he made, with the bright red backdrop and sinister lighting, was perhaps the worst speech any U.S. president has ever made, when factoring in the background. All that was missing was the hammer and sickle, or a Lenin-style goatee on Creepy Joe's chin. The Stupid Party objected a bit to that speech, in their weak, customary manner, but it should have offended every American. If only the sane remaining among us were allowed to be offended in America 2.0.\n\nOn occasion, Creepy Joe's attention is distracted from the hair and undeveloped chests of little girls, onto adult women. Dr. Jill was an adult (I think) after all, when she started babysitting the Biden children. Maybe he loved her shampoo. But then there was Tara Reade. Reade accused then Senator Biden of doing something remarkably similar to what E. Jean Carroll would accuse Donald Trump of. Only Tara could recall the year it happened, unlike Carroll. And she has never been videotaped writhing around on the floor like a lunatic, unlike Carroll. I seriously doubt she has a dog named Tits or paints her trees blue, like Carroll does. Reade was ridiculed by the same state controlled press and feminists who believed Carroll. A ridiculous jury awarded Carroll millions of dollars. Reade fled to Russia for her own safety.\n\nHollywood and the kept media make fun of Trump's sons. There are inferences about Eric being \"special.\" Riding the short bus. Those distasteful remarks are just fine, as long as they're made against the \"right\" people. They are free to joke all they want about young Barron Trump, for instance, regarding whether he's on the autistic spectrum. You know, the spectrum that didn't exist until about thirty years ago. You'll lose your medical license if you suggest there's a connection there to all the massive increases in vaccines doled out to our children. But no comedian jokes about Ashley Biden's numerous brushes with the law. Or the unmentioned Biden, Creepy Joe's brother Frank, who has a crime record the sainted George Floyd would have envied. The \"Big Guy\" has a niece, Caroline, who also has had several run-ins with the law.\n\nHave you heard anyone, including Fox News, Breitbart, or other conservative outlets, talk about the Biden crime family? Remember poor Billy Carter? He was ridiculed and considered a real embarrassment to the still living former peanut farmer. He never wracked up all the DUIs that Frank Biden has. But Billy Beer was pretty putrid, for those of you old enough to remember it. Even young Amy Carter and young Chelsea Clinton had their looks cruelly mocked by comedians. No comedian is about to mock Hunter Biden, famously photographed asleep with a crack pipe in his mouth, let alone Ashley Biden. Can you imagine what the hysterical shrews on The View would say if Ivanka Trump had written about inappropriate showers with her father?\n\nNow, all Biden's greatest crimes appear to have been committed before he developed dementia, Alzheimer's, or whatever it is that he has. I doubt if Hunter or anyone else is even giving him his ten percent cut nowadays. Over the course of his presidency, Biden has been caught on film uttering inanities that often sound alien in nature. Maybe it's the Reptile in him coming out. How many times have we seen him wandering off, like a misguided toddler. He did this recently at an international gathering, and despite the fact that the president of Italy was captured on film grabbing him by the arm, and leading him back to safety, Biden's ridiculous DEI press secretary insisted that the video had been altered. His doddering was termed a \"cheap fake,\" or \"deep fake,\" depending on the source. Who can argue with that?\n\nJoe Biden, in fact, has been so absurd in his role as president that many suggest he is a cheap or deep fake. Some say the real Biden died a while back, and has been replaced by a clone or robot. Boy, you'd think they could make a more realistic and competent clone or robot than that. It makes one cringe to watch him try to express himself. He reminds me very much of the Peter Sellers character in the film Being There. Although Biden is not known to have been mentally challenged during his life, and nothing he's said as president could ever be mistaken for profundity, as was the case with the Sellers' character. He is also prone to making his key points in a menacing whisper. No, his stutter isn't a lifelong thing, as his old filmed speeches demonstrate. It is unknown at what age he began inappropriately touching little girls.\n\nBiden has issued more racist comments than Donald Trump could ever dream up. He has stated that those Blacks who don't vote for him are not really Black. He called inner city schools \"jungles.\" He compared poor students to White students. Senator Joe Biden helped put untold numbers of nonviolent Black crack cocaine addicts in prison. He simply makes up stories about his past, depending on his audience. He obviously didn't go to a historically Black college, as he told a Black audience. He wasn't practically raised in a synagogue, as he bragged to a Jewish audience. At least the \"Corn Pop was a bad dude\" story was funny. Fictional, but funny. Funnier than the millions of illegals he has opened the border to, flown around the country, and deposited in five star hotels. While our own homeless citizens crap in the streets.\n\nJoe Biden's \"performance\" in the presidential debate the other night exposed the serious problems he has with his faculties at this point. He was filmed after the debate, struggling, with the help of someone on each side, to navigate one step down off the stage. Dr. Jill, who is essentially his handler, was recorded congratulating him for \"answering all the questions,\" in the manner a mother would praise a preschooler for using the potty by himself. It is unclear if Joe Biden is potty trained now. Rumors persist that he has publicly pooped his pants, with the latest incident being at a Normandy commemoration ceremony. Those with TDS insist that Trump has done this as well, and wears adult diapers. Maybe neither of them is potty trained. No one can say that the American people aren't offered the best and the brightest choices.\n\nExactly what record would Joe Biden run on? The billions given to Ukraine? Anyone who buys gas or shops at a grocery store knows that inflation is now worse than it has ever been in our lives. And yet Creepy Joe just cites phony statistics to claim otherwise. His administration is peopled with politically correct, sideshow circus freaks. While there is no known sword swallower, there was the bald, red dressed high ranking official who kept stealing women's luggage at airports. And then there is our health czar Rachel Levine, who I suppose somehow \"identifies\" as a healthy person. The other day, the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy gender fluids visited the White House. Vice presidential cackler Kamala Harris actually answered the door. You know George Washington and Thomas Jefferson would be proud.\n\nI don't know what they're planning to do with Biden.\n\nThe day after the debate, he sounded suspiciously more lucid. He's done that before. Dementia doesn't usually work that way. Maybe presidential dementia is different.\n\nPerhaps we'll get Gruesome Newsom. Or Hillary could stage a Brett Favre-like comeback. The sensational rumors about Michelle Obama actually being Big Mike, would cover all the DEI bases. It would represent a national \"Woke\" orgasm. They could have the \"big reveal\" in the Rose Garden. Or they could just opt to install Biden again. It's not like he could be much less capable of the job than he's been since his initial selection. He'll have all the fawning press coverage he needs. His absurd persona will be off-limits to the late night comedians. No one better epitomizes the America 2.0 version of \"democracy.\"\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

He said President Biden's policies have seen inflation, crime, and illegal immigration rise.\n\n\"African Americans are getting slaughtered, Hispanic Americans are getting slaughtered,\" President Trump said.\n\n\"These millions and millions of people that are coming into our country-the biggest impact and the biggest negative impact is against our black population and our Hispanic population who are losing their jobs, losing their housing, losing everything they can lose.\"\n\nThe presumptive Republican nominee won loud applause when he promised to \"throw out\" Biden's economic policies on \"Day One\" and \"replace it with MAGAnomics.\"\n\n\"The minute Joe Biden shuffles out the door, I will rapidly rebuild the greatest economy in the history of the world,\" he added.\n\nPresident Trump also used the rally to share his plans for the city-which is home to some of his sprawling business empire.\n\nThe former U.S. leader, likewise, vowed to bolster public safety and access to education, among other things.\n\n\"I'm here tonight to declare we are going to turn New York City around, and we are going to turn it around very, very quickly,\" President Trump said moments after taking the stage.\n\n\"We're going to bring safety back to our streets, we're going to bring success back to our schools, we're going to bring prosperity back to every neighborhood in every borough of the greatest city in our land.\"\n\nPresident Trump also vowed to reduce taxes while simultaneously bringing business and \"big taxpayers\" back to New York.\n\n\"We are going to make New York bigger, better, and more beautiful than ever before, and that includes right here in the Bronx,\" he declared to a cheering crowd.\n\nThe real estate mogul added that the overhaul of New York would be funded by \"our great and beautiful White House\" as soon as he takes office if he were to win in the Nov. 5 presidential elections.\n\nPresident Trump also spoke of how the city was close to his heart while praising New Yorkers, who he said had built the city into \"the towering forests of iron, aluminum, concrete, and steel.\"\n\n\"We made the city and state into the capital of global commerce, we turned our hometown into the bustling center of a confident glamorous American culture, and we inspired the entire world, we inspired the world,\" he said. \"But sadly, this is now a city in decline.\"\n\nAttendees before a rally with former President Donald Trump in the South Bronx in New York City on May 23, 2024. (Samira Bouaou/The Epoch Times)\n\nThe businessman also used Thursday's rally to highlight the ongoing homelessness and drug crisis plaguing the city while taking aim at what get said were \"mobs of migrants fighting our police officers and giving America the middle finger.\"\n\n\"Throughout my life, I've seen New York through good times and bad times, through boom times and crime waves, through market crashes and terrorist attacks, but I've never seen it quite like this,\" President Trump said.\n\nPresident Trump's rally in the Bronx neighborhood comes amid a brief pause in his criminal trial in Manhattan, with the jury set to begin deliberations on whether or not to convict him of felony charges next week.\n\nThe former U.S. leader has been charged in connection to a $130,000 payment from his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to Stephanie Clifford, better known as adult entertainment actress Stormy Daniels, during his 2016 campaign.\n\nHe has pleaded not guilty to all counts.\n\nThe Epoch Times has contacted the White House for comment.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

Pelletier, a paraplegic, was convicted and sentenced for smuggling marijuana from Canada to Maine - both of which later legalized the drug.\n\nPelletier lost the use of his legs as a child and has struggled - especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \"I don't have much strength in my arms due to lack of physical therapy,\" Pelletier explained, \"so the prison staff hired another prisoner to push me around the compound. He died from COVID.\"\n\nDespite also suffering from type-2 diabetes, Pelletier survived the novel coronavirus. He said that his petition has been waiting since its submission \"during the Obama clemency project, but was never ruled on.\" But even before finally being freed, Pelletier was optimistic. \"I honestly believe President Trump will be the man who will end this nightmare and reunite me with my family,\" he said.\n\nCooper, meanwhile, had already seen one of his sentences reduced to 25 years by Trump's First Step Act. Unfortunately, the provided reductions were not retroactive.\n\nIn November, Cooper's attorney Patrick Michael Megaro told the New York Post :\n\nBiden is responsible for the 1994 crime law that [resulted in] Corvain Cooper being sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for marijuana and the Obama-Biden administration was directly responsible for the prosecution and conviction of Corvain Cooper under the 1994 crime law.\n\nOn Wednesday, Megaro said \"the system failed Corvain Cooper; Barack Obama's promises not to seek lengthy prison sentences for non-violent drug offenders and to grant clemency to those that were unjustly impacted proved to be hollow promises.\" Now, after years of waiting, he will finally be free.\n\nTrump signed 73 pardons and 70 commutations in total on January 19, his final full day in office. They were issued early Wednesday. Others offered mercy for their non-violent marijuana life sentences were Ferrell Damon Scott, Anthony DeJohn, Craig Cesal, and James Romans.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

James O. Eastland (D-MS), to push for mandatory minimum sentencing that would limit judges' decision-making in sentencing.\n\nAn October 1995 report from the Sentencing Project, a group that advocates for criminal justice reform, discovered that between 1989 and 1995, the percentage of young black men who were incarcerated or on probation soared from 23 percent to 32 percent.\n\nIn the first five years of the Obama administration when Biden was vice president, the number of federal prisoners also increased .\n\nYet despite his history of being tough on crime in the past, Biden called the drug bill he and other senators passed in the 1980s \"a mistake.\"\n\n\"We should not send anybody to jail for a pure drug offense,\" Biden said at the debate on Thursday. \"They should be going into treatment.\"\n\n1994 Crime Bill , Donald Trump , James Eastland , Joe Biden , Presidential Debate"

      "text": "Instagram Censors Post Linking Joe Biden to Mass Incarceration\n\nFacebook-owned social media platform Instagram recently censored a post linking Joe Biden to his 1994 crime bill which contributed to the mass incarceration of black people. The platform relied on independent \"fact checker\" USA Today to label connections between Biden and mass incarceration as \"false.\"\n\nThe New York Post reports that the Facebook-owned photo-sharing platform Instagram recently labeled a post by a user claiming that President-elect Joe Biden's 1994 crime bill contributed to the mass jailing of black people as \"false.\" The claim that Biden's 1994 crime law contributed to the mass incarceration of black people has been vehemently supported by criminal justice reform advocates on both the right and left.\n\nArtist Brad Troemel, who boasts over 100,000 Instagram followers, posted a photo of Biden alongside former President Bill Clinton with a caption stating : \"Find someone that looks at you the way Biden looked at Clinton after Clinton signed Biden's crime bill into law. Bringing mass incarceration to black Americans.\"\n\nThe post quickly received a label stating that it included \"False Information.\" A message further explained that: \"Independent fact-checkers say this information has no basis in fact.\" The fact-check further stated that the claim was rated \"False\" by USA Today reporter Doug Stanglin, in July.\n\nA Facebook spokesperson told the Post that it will not change the fact-check unless USA Today changes its assessment. The spokesperson stated: \"People can appeal a rating by contacting a fact-checking partner directly. Fact-checking partners are ultimately responsible for deciding whether to update a rating, which will lift enforcement on the content.\"\n\nWhile the effects of Biden's crime bill are disputed, many have claimed that Biden's bill led to mass incarceration. Harvard Divinity School professor Cornel West, who actually backed Biden for President this year, said in an interview , \"When [Biden] says it didn't contribute to mass incarceration, I tell him he has to get off his symbolic crack pipe.\"\n\nIn a recent interview , host of the popular radio show The Breakfast Club , Charlamagne Tha God, commented: \"When [Biden] was on the Breakfast Club, another part of that interview that people miss is that I asked him about the '94 crime bill, and the '94 crime bill being the catalyst for mass incarceration in this country. And he said it wasn't the crime bill, it was the '86 mandatory minimum sentencing. But I'm like, 'Joe, you wrote that too.'\"\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

Yes, I decided to go up the rough side of the mountain, as we say in church. And I didn't fix the entire system.\"\n\nHarris in her remarks also repeated the false narrative Trump has not denounced white supremacy.\n\n\"Donald Trump, who in the last debate, stood on the debate stage and refused to condemn white supremacists,\" Harris said.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, Trump has repeatedly denounced white supremacists and his administration has, in fact, prosecuted extremists during his tenure as president.\n\nNewsweek reported on the record prosecutions of white supremacists under Trump:\n\nSixty-four white supremacists have been sentenced to a combined total of 820 years' imprisonment in what is believed to be the largest collective prosecution of white supremacists in the United States, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Texas.\n\n\"Not only do white supremacist gangs endorse repugnant ideologies, they also facilitate a violent drug and gun trade, putting our citizens in grave danger,\" U.S. Attorney Erin Nealy Cox said in a press release. \"We were alarmed - but not necessarily surprised - at the quantities of drugs and firearms recovered during this investigation. The U.S. Attorney's Office is committed to working with our law enforcement partners to dismantle these organizations, disrupt their criminal activities, and put their members behind bars.\"\n\nHarris said Trump doesn't care about blacks based on his response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"The people of Georgia deserve to have a president who sees them, who cares about them,\" Harris said. \"Georgia has been so hard hit by the pandemic.\"\n\nA woman cheers while Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) speaks to supports while visiting Morehouse College in Atlanta, Georgia. Harris is in Georgia to make a push for early voting. According to reports more than 2.3 million votes have been cast in the state through early in-person voting or through mail-in voting so far. (Megan Varner/Getty Images)\n\n\"Democrats hope Harris, the first woman of color on a major party's presidential ticket, will energize black voters who form the backbone of the state's Democratic Party,\" AJC reported.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported on Harris' time as a prosecutor:\n\nStarting in the late 1960s, one lurid murder after another fed public perceptions that crime in California was spiraling out of control. Gang shootings turned neighborhoods into combat zones. The crack epidemic ravaged communities.\n\nFear and outrage spawned a raft of harsh sentencing laws. California enacted one of its most punitive, \"three strikes and you're out,\" after one parolee killed 18-year-old Kimber Reynolds of Fresno in 1992 and another kidnapped and killed 12-year-old Polly Klaas of Sonoma County a year later.\n\nThe laws strengthening criminal penalties drove a surge in the state's prison population over 30 years, beginning in the 1970s. Under both Republicans and Democrats - including Kamala Harris, who became a prosecutor in 1990 - a tough-on-crime political culture flourished in California, and African Americans were hit hardest: Their incarceration rate remains more than five times their share of California's population.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Joe Biden Abandons Long-Held Support for Death Penalty\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden is abandoning his decades-long support for the federal death penalty as he seeks the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nIn a wide-sweeping criminal justice reform plan released on Tuesday, the former vice president called for the elimination of the federal death penalty. Biden, who led the effort to expand capital punishment amid rising crime rates in the 1990s, couched his new-found opposition to the death penalty in terms of protecting the innocent.\n\n\"Over 160 individuals who've been sentenced to death in this country since 1973 have later been exonerated,\" the plan states. \"Because we cannot ensure we get death penalty cases right every time, Biden will work to pass legislation to eliminate the death penalty at the federal level, and incentivize states to follow the federal government's example.\"\n\nEven though advancements in DNA analysis having made such instances nearly non-existent, Biden proposes that individuals convicted of heinous crimes \"instead serve life sentences without probation or parole.\"\n\nThe plan comes as Biden is facing increased scrutiny for his law and order record. Social justice activists, in particular, have centered their criticism on his tenure leading the Senate Judiciary Committee in the 1990s, which he used to author the 1994 crime bill. Activists have seized on the bill, which has been recognized to have targeted black American males for higher prison sentences, as proof that Biden created the current system of mass incarceration.\n\nIn May, shortly after announcing his presidential bid, Biden was confronted by protesters in Nashua, New Hampshire, with that very accusation. In the face of the protesters, the 76-year-old former vice president stood defiant, saying the notion his legislation \"generated mass incarceration\" was wrong.\n\nAlthough the bill is controversial for its effects on the prison population, few have noted the impact it has had on the death penalty. Prior to the law, there were only a certain of number of federal offenses that were eligible for the death penalty. After Biden and his allies were done crafting the legislation, however, more than 50 new federal offenses were created under which the death penalty could be pursued as punishment. Among the list of new crimes included murders related to drug dealing, drive-by shootings, and the killing of a law enforcement office, along with others.\n\nBiden, who has previously called the crime bill his greatest achievement, even boasted about the new death penalty offenses when pushing the measure through Congress.\n\n\"Let me tell you what is in the bill, and I'll let you all decide whether or not this is weak,\" he said during a speech on the Senate floor in 1992. \"Let me get down here a compendium of the things that are in the bill. One, the death penalty. It provides 53 death-penalty offenses. Weak as can be, you know?\"\n\n\"We do everything but hang people for jaywalking in this bill,\" Biden added. In the lead up to passage, he also characterized the legislation as the best weapon available against the \"predators on our streets\" who showed they were '\"beyond the pale\" through their crimes.\n\nBiden continued to support the death penalty after the legislation passed and its effects were beginning to be felt. In 2000, during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on a post-conviction DNA testing, Biden reiterated his support for the death penalty and dismissed question over the morality of capital punishment.\n\n\"I support the death penalty,\" he told the committee. \"Let me put it this way: I don't oppose the death penalty on moral grounds, but I have been fastidious ... that if you are going to have a death penalty, you had better go out of your way to make sure you don't execute an innocent person.\"\n\nTo that end, Biden argued expanding the use of DNA testing and ensuring plaintiffs had the best legal help available would go a long way.\n\nOn Tuesday, Biden did not elaborate on his plans for how to \"eliminate\" the death penalty. If elected, it is certain he would face major obstacles to achieving that goal. Any major change to the existing federal penal code would require congressional approval. Currently, there is no indication that enough support exists, within either party, for abolishing the death penalty. Despite the Democrat's 2016 platform calling for such an act, the issue is very much divisive between moderates and progressives.\n\nThere would also likely be political consequences for Biden and the Democrats if they attempted to push such a measure through Congress. According to polling by Gallup, 56 percent of Americans support the death penalty in cases where the criminal is convicted of murder. On the broader question of the death penalty being morally tolerable, an even larger majority of Americans - 60 percent - agreed it was an acceptable form of punishment.\n\nBiden's criminal justice reform comes only weeks after the frontrunner pledged to cut the U.S. incarceration rate by more than 50 percent if elected president. It is unclear if his proposal, which includes the abolition of all mandatory minimum sentences and ending incarceration for drug offenses, will meet that goal.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Trump's 1st Term: Lowest Black Imprisonment Rate in 31 Years, Clemency Gives Inmates Second Chance\n\nPresident Donald Trump has made criminal justice reform a priority during his first administration and his efforts have paid off, from signing into law the First Step Act to help individuals successfully transition back into society, to the lowest rate of incarceration for blacks in 31 years, and on Wednesday he granted clemency to five non-violent inmates whom he believes deserve a second chance.\n\n• Lenora Logan was sentenced to 27 years in prison for her involvement in a cocaine conspiracy. Aside from saving a prison nurse from being attacked by another inmate, during her time behind bars she served as a suicide watch companion, a nursing assistant for those in hospice care, and a leader of the praise and worship team.\n\nLogan wrote in a letter to President Trump:\n\nBeing a recovering addict of 23 years, I now have been on the other side of the spectrum. Now I see how devastating the lives of others are effected by the crime I committed. I am very remorseful for the part I played in the crime, and if I could do it all again I certainly would do things differently. I never would have sold or used drugs at all.\n\nI ask for this chance to contribute with my experience to help others to learn from their mistakes, just as I have from my own mistakes. If given this opportunity it would not be taken lightly, nor in vain, but instead it would be used to give back to society, not only to save my children's lives, but others from going down the same path I did.\n\n• Rashella Reed was convicted of wire fraud and money laundering. While in prison, Reed used her teaching background to tutor inmates and facilitate children's programs in the prison.\n\n\"She was serving 14 years in prison for her role in an $8 million food stamp scheme,\" the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported . \"Now the former Atlanta Public Schools teacher is a free woman, thanks to President Donald Trump.\"\n\n• Charles Tanner was a young professional boxer who at 24 was sentenced to life in prison for a drug charge - his first criminal conviction. His sentence was later reduced to 30 years. Before his clemency, he served 16 years in prison.\n\n\"On Wednesday, President Donald Trump granted clemency to Tanner and four other people convicted of committing drug and financial crimes,\" the NWI Times reported . \"Tanner said he learned the news Wednesday morning, when he was called into the prison office.\"\n\n\"They said, 'Hey, you're going home today,'\" Tanner said. \"President Trump signed clemency for you and you have to get out of here.' I broke down praying right there in that office.\"\n\n• John Bolen was a small business owner who allowed his boat to be used to transport cocaine from the Bahamas to Florida. After a jury trial, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for his first conviction. Before his clemency, he served 13 years in prison. His wife, June Bolen, put a petition up on the change.org website asking Trump to pardon him. \"Please help me bring my high school sweetheart and soulmate home,\" she wrote . Their son was eight years old when Bolen was sent to prison.\n\n• Curtis McDonald, now 70, was convicted in 1996 for drug trafficking and money laundering. After a jury trial, he was sentenced to life in prison.  He was a first-time offender who served nearly 24 years in prison.\n\nThe Commercial Appeal reported on Trump granting McDonald clemency:\n\nIn 2018, President Trump granted clemency to Alice Marie Johnson, who was serving a life sentence for the minor role she played in a Houston-to-Memphis drug trafficking ring in the 1990s.\n\nYet Johnson didn't rest after her release. She fought for the release of her co-defendant, Curtis McDonald, who was also serving a life sentence that could have easily turned into a death sentence after he was diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nSo now, after months of advocating for McDonald, and after his family and other supporters marched for him in downtown Memphis on Juneteenth , Trump granted clemency to McDonald and four other inmates who turned their lives around while in prison.\n\nThe Associated Press reported on Trump's latest clemencies:\n\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Wednesday in a statement that Trump was granting the clemencies \"in light of the decisions these individuals have made following their convictions to improve their lives and the lives of others while incarcerated.\"\n\nThe latest round of clemencies comes less than two weeks before Election Day and as Trump has been hammering Democrat Joe Biden over his tough-on-crime record during his time in the U.S. Senate. Biden, as head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, helped shepherd the 1994 crime bill that many criminal justice experts say contributed to harsh sentences and mass incarceration of black people.\n\nWashington Examiner columnist Paul Bedard reported on the Department of Justice report on the drop in rates of incarceration:\n\nAmerica's imprisonment rate has dropped to its lowest level since 1995, led by a dive in the percentage of blacks and Hispanics sent to jail during the Trump administration, according to a new Justice Department tally. For minorities, the focus of President Trump's First Step Act prison and criminal reform plan, the rate is the lowest in years.\n\nFor blacks, the imprisonment rate in state and federal prisons is the lowest in 31 years, and for Hispanics, it is down 24%.\n\n\"Across the decade from 2009 to 2019, the imprisonment rate fell 29 percent among black residents, 24 percent among Hispanic residents and 12 percent among white residents. In 2019, the imprisonment rate of black residents was the lowest it has been in 30 years, since 1989,\" said the report.\n\nThe report considers incarceration as individuals who spend more than one year in prison and it gave no specific reason for the rate drop.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

Overall, Trump has experienced a 24 percent bump in approval among likely black voters since Monday:\n\nDuring a segment on race in America, Trump hammered former Vice President Joe Biden for failing to get anything substantive done for the black community during his 47 years in politics, blasting his 1994 crime bill, specifically.\n\n\"Nobody has done more for the black community than Donald Trump. And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln - possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I've done,\" Trump said, citing his strides in criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, and historically black colleges and universities.\n\nTrump also claimed that Biden used the term \"super predators. While he had used the phrase \"predators on our streets\" in a 1993 speech defending the crime bill, it was former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who used the term \"super predators.\"\n\nNonetheless, Biden attempted to defend his record, prompting Trump to ask why he failed to get anything done during his eight years serving in the Obama-Biden administration.\n\n\"You were vice president. You keep talking about all these things you're going to do and you're going to do this. But you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump later added, \"You know, Joe, I ran because of you.\"\n\n\"I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job. If I said you did a good job, I would have never run. I would've never run. I ran because of you. I'm looking at you now, you're a politician. I ran because of you,\" he added, noting that Biden represents a typical politician with \"all talk\" and \"no action\":\n\nDuring the segment, Biden sarcastically referred to Trump as Abraham Lincoln, remarking, \"Abraham Lincoln here is one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history.\"\n\n\"This guy has a dog whistle about as big as a fog horn,\" he added.\n\n\"I said not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I've done for the black community. I didn't say 'I'm Abraham Lincoln.' I said, 'Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done but what I've done for the black community,\" Trump clarified.\n\n\"Now you have done nothing other than the crime bill, which put tens of thousands of black men, mostly, in jail,\" Trump said, prompting an \"Oh God\" from Biden.\n\n\"And you know what? They remember it because it you look at what's happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly,\" he added. \"Just take a look at what's happening out there.\"\n\nThe Rasmussen Reports tracking poll also showed Trump's overall approval standing at 51 percent.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

Says 'The Justice Reform Movement Gains An Ally In' The 'White House'\n\nMinutes before Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46 th President of the United States on Wednesday, Los Angeles County's new controversial progressive district attorney expressed solidarity with the new administration on social media.\n\n\"Today, the justice reform movement gains an ally in [the] White House,\" tweeted L.A. County District Attorney George Gascón. \"Biden's promise to confront mass incarceration fills me with hope. It's past time to reform our bail system, decriminalize marijuana, abolish the death penalty & so much more.\"\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GeorgeGascon/status/1351932855534772224\n\nGascón, who took over as L.A. County's top prosecutor in December, issued a set of special directives that has sparked a revolt from local law enforcement groups and several deputy district attorneys within his office.\n\nEarlier this month, Gascón said the \"Biden-Harris administration\" would \"have the mandate they need to meaningfully reform our criminal justice system\" after Democrats won the Senate runoff elections in Georgia. Gascón said that the people Biden has chosen to lead the Department of Justice would \"work to do the tough but critical work of restoring trust between law enforcement and the communities they are sworn to protect and serve,\" and \"hold police departments accountable for abuses of power.\"\n\nHowever, several progressive leaders and activist groups are apprehensive after reflecting on Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' records on criminal justice issues. Both had previously supported tough-on-crime policies that have been blamed for contributing to the mass incarceration of black people. During the presidential campaign, Biden said he made a mistake by authoring and supporting President Bill Clinton's 1994 crime bill that put more cops in black neighborhoods and incentivized states to construct more prisons. Meanwhile, Harris vowed to correct racially biased policies within the legal system, despite serving 27 years as a prosecutor enforcing harsh sentencing laws.\n\nThe Biden administration has promised to \"deliver criminal justice reform\" as part of its agenda to advance racial equity, which it has categorized among its \"immediate priorities.\"\n\nStill, The Washington Post recently reported that \"Biden has avoided speaking in detail about criminal justice reform\" since winning the election. The outlet reported that while on the campaign trail, \"Biden's message was at times unclear.\"\n\nMore details from the Post:\n\nAlthough he supported ending capital punishment and mandatory minimums in federal sentencing, privately-run prison contracts and cash bail, he opposed other policies supported by some of his Democratic rivals, including allowing people to vote while incarcerated. And Biden said he favored letting states decide whether to adopt \"red-flag\" laws, which create a process for police or family members to obtain court orders temporarily restricting access to guns by people who pose a danger to themselves or others.\n\nBiden has proposed ramping up Justice Department investigations of police departments accused of a \"pattern or practice\" of abuse, which can lead to court-ordered reform agreements called consent decrees. The Justice Department opened more than two dozen such investigations under the Obama administration, but quickly abandoned them under Trump.\n\nA comprehensive criminal justice plan Biden released in July also called for ending the disparity in federal sentencing for crimes involving powder and crack cocaine, decriminalizing marijuana and shifting government resources from incarceration to crime prevention.\n\nD.A. Gascón has said he is \"excited\" for President Biden and Vice President Harris to \"fully\" execute the bipartisan First Step Act, which he said was built on legislation written by Biden and enacted by the Obama administration. He did not acknowledge the bill had been signed into law by President Donald J. Trump in 2018. The policy instituted sweeping sentencing reforms for some drug offenses, expanded job training for federal inmates to reduce recidivism, and broadened early-release programs that reduced the prison population.\n\nRelated: Los Angeles County's New Progressive D.A.

      "text": "5 Dead And 42 Wounded From Shootings In Chicago Over The Weekend\n\nOver the weekend, 42 people were wounded and 5 people were killed in the Windy City as a result of shootings, according to Fox News . The deaths come amid a national debate on guns after the recent tragedies in El Paso and Dayton.\n\nCBS Chicago reports that last weekend 7 people were killed and 46 were wounded from shooting-related incidences. The prior weekend 8 people were killed and 39 were wounded. The weekend before that, 9 were killed and 32 more were wounded. During fourth of July weekend, nearly 70 people were shot, five of which would eventually succumb to their injuries. This trend continues week after week, month after month, year after year, and decade after decade.\n\nSo far this year, 309 people have been killed in Chicago, as reported by the Chicago Tribune . That figures averages out to 1.6 murders per day since January 1st. The city is also on track to nearly match the body count of Detroit and Baltimore combined. If the average rate of murders keeps up, then 587 people in the city will die from gunfire in 2019.\n\nThe demographics of the deceased are not evenly distributed among the races. A preponderance of those killed are black, as 75 percent of the victims are African American. While Hispanics make up the second-largest group, they make up only 18 percent of all victims. The percentages are not consistent with the demographics of the city, as only 30 percent of the city is black. This means that black people are disproportionately hit by a factor of 2.6. Men are also over-represented on the list of the dead, accounting for 90% of the victims. These numbers are according to the most recent data released from the Chicago Police Department .\n\nAlthough these statistics are horrible, the homicide rate is significantly lower than it was in 2016 and 2017. The reason for this is mainly the subsidence of the so-called \"Ferguson effect.\" The \"Ferguson effect\" is the feeling of distrust and resentment towards the police by local racial minorities. This occurred nationwide after a white police officer shot Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Missouri - a shooting the Obama Department of Justice determined was justified after an extensive review of the evidence and 40 witness testimonies. The fracturing of the bond between local communities and their constables, along with federal pressure applied to local police, weakened the effectiveness of law enforcement. The diminished capabilities of the police created a vacuum that criminals exploited.\n\nThe country at-large witnessed a rise in violent crime, with Chicago especially experiencing a huge surge in gun-related homicides.\n\nChicago has been a violent city for a long time and is notorious for being a hotbed of illegality, going back to the days of bootlegging by characters such as Al Capone in the 1920s. A crime wave hit the city in 1965 and it never truly subsided. Shootings would reach their peak in 1994. The violence was so great that Congress was forced to act. The federal government passed the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which is known as the \"1994 Crime Bill.\" Since the bill was passed, crime has decreased significantly. While shooting remains the highest of any city across much of the Western world, the situation has significantly improved.

      "text": "'You're full of sh**!': 6 Times Joe Biden Lost His Temper Before Becoming President\n\n\"You're full of sh**!\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden is known to throw a tantrum every now and then, especially when he is frustrated or caught off guard by a question or statement. It's a trait we saw throughout the 2020 election, both on the campaign trail and during debates.\n\nWe saw Biden tell a Michigan autoworker he is \"full of sh**\" for believing the then-candidate was in favor of gun confiscation. He also flipped at a reporter for asking about Hunter Biden fathering a child while dating his brother's widow. And who could forget the debate where Biden called Trump a \"clown\" because he was frustrated about it being \"hard to get any word in\"?\n\nThroughout his nearly 50 years in politics, Biden has produced multiple similarly-fiery moments. Here are a few notable examples of when Joe Biden's temper got the best of him.\n\n1987: Biden challenges a voter over who has a higher IQ\n\nDuring a 1987 presidential campaign event in Claremont, New Hampshire, Sen. Biden challenged a voter over who had the higher IQ.\n\n\"What law school did you attend and where did you place in that class?\" a person in the crowd asked.\n\nBiden quickly responded by listing off his supposed academic accomplishments.\n\n\"I think I probably have a higher IQ than you, I suspect,\" Biden replied to the man. \"I went to law school on a full academic scholarship, the only one in my class to have a full academic scholarship. The first year in law school I decided I didn't want to be in law school and ended up in the bottom two-thirds of my class and then decided I wanted to stay.\"\n\nAccording to the then-senator, he returned to law school his second year and eventually graduated in the top half of his class.\n\n\"I won the international moot court competition. I was the outstanding student in the political science department at the end of my year,\" he explained. \"I graduated with three degrees from undergraduate school and 165 credits, only needed 123 credits, and I'd be delighted to sit down and compare my IQ to yours if you'd like, Frank.\"\n\nAccording to Newsweek , Biden lied about his academic achievements.\n\n\"On the tape Biden appears hyper, glib, intellectually insecure. But there is another problem: Biden did not go to Syracuse Law School on a 'full academic scholarship.' He went on a half scholarship based on financial need,\" the outlet reported at the time. \"He didn't finish in the 'top half' of his class. He was 76th out of 85. If he won an international moot-court competition, he has inexplicably neglected to list it on his resume. He did not win the award given to the outstanding political-science student at his undergraduate college, the University of Delaware. Finally, he didn't graduate from Delaware with 'three degrees,' but with a single B.A. in political science and history.\"\n\nAt the time, Biden released a statement to The New York Times explaining the discrepancies:\n\nI graduated from the University of Delaware with a double major in history and political science. My reference to degrees at the Claremont event was intended to refer to these majors - I said \"three\" and should have said \"two.\"\n\nWith regard to my being the outstanding student in the political science department, my name was put up for that award by David Ingersoll, who is still at the University of Delaware.\n\nMy recollection is - and I'd have to confirm this - but I don't recall paying any money to go to law school.\n\nI exaggerate when I'm angry but I've never gone around telling people things that aren't true about me.\n\n﻿\n\n1994: Biden delivers a speech about the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act\n\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Joe Biden made a case for the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, a bill he co-authored with former Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT).\n\n\"The Biden-Hatch crime bill, as it becomes law, God-willing, I hope that we will have ended, once and for all, this notion that is a hangover from the 60s that somehow Democrats are weak on crime and Democratic presidents are weak on crime, and Republicans are tough on crime,\" Biden said during a floor speech. \"The truth is that every major crime bill since 1976 that's come out of this Congress - every minor crime bill - has had the name of the Democratic senator from the state of Delaware, Joe Biden, on that bill and has had a majority vote of the Democratic members of the United States Senate on the bill.\"\n\nAccording to Biden, his goal with the 1994 crime bill was to \"end crime\" and end the \"carnage\" that stems from the idea that Democrats are weak on crime.\n\n\"Crime is not Democrat or Republican. Making the streets safe is not a Democratic or Republican issue,\" he explained. \"This is one of those issues, I hope, this passage of this bill will do - will be taken out of the gridlock category and move into an emerging consensus.\"\n\nBiden indicated he's uninterested in learning about a person's background and how their upbringing resulted in a life of crime.\n\n\"It doesn't matter whether or not they're the victims of society. The end result is they're going to knock my mother on the head with a lead pipe, shoot my sister, beat up my wife, take on my sons,\" Biden said. \"So I don't want to ask what made them do this. They must be taken off the street! That's number one. There's a consensus on that.\"\n\nHe made the argument that elected officials have to \"do something\" for the \"cadres of young people\" who were born out of out wedlock and without adequate parent supervision because they weren't properly \"socialized.\"\n\n﻿\n\nSince then, the 1994 crime bill has been considered the source behind the further incarceration rate of black Americans, particularly low-level offenders. It's something both conservatives and progressives have agreed upon.\n\nSeptember 2019: Biden scolds Fox News' Peter Doocy for not asking Trump questions about the Ukrainian whistleblower.\n\nWhile on the campaign trail in Iowa, Fox News reporter Peter Doocy asked Biden about his \" admission that he used his position as Vice President to shut down a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating a company that was employing Biden's son,\" The Daily Wire reported at the time.\n\n\"Mr. Vice President, how many times have you ever spoken to your son about his overseas business dealings?\" Fox News reporter Peter Doocy asked.\n\n\"I've never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings,\" Biden replied.\n\n\"And so how do you know ...\" Doocy said, attempting to ask a question.\n\n\"Here's what I know,\" Biden replied, pointing his finger in Doocy's face. \"I know Trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him the question: why is he on the phone with a foreign leader, trying to intimidate a foreign leader, if that's what happened?\"\n\nBiden turned to others in the press pool and encouraged them to \"look into Trump.\"\n\n\"I'll beat him like a drum,\" Biden said about President Trump. \"And he's using an abuse of power and every element of the presidency to try and do something to smear me.\"\n\nAccording to Biden, \"Everybody looked at this and everybody's looked at it and said there's nothing there.\"\n\nHe turned back to Doocy. \"Ask the right questions!\" he shouted at the reporter.\n\n﻿\n\nNovember 2019: Biden faces off with Doocy again, this time over Hunter Biden fathering a child with a stripper.\n\nIn 2019, reports surfaced that Hunter Biden fathered a child with Lunden Alexis Robert, a stripper he met in Washington, D.C. When Peter Doocy asked Joe Biden about the situation, the former vice president became irritated.\n\n\"Mr. Vice President, I'm wondering: do you have a comment on this report and court filing out of Arkansas that your son Hunter just made you a grandfather?\" the reporter asked.\n\n\"No, that's a private matter,\" Biden replied.\n\n\"I have no comment. But only you would ask that,\" he said, pointing to Doocy. \"You're a good man. You're a good man.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Doocy replied.\n\n\"Classy,\" Biden said with a smirk.\n\nHere's a different angle provided via Fox News that shows Biden's facial expression as he was asked the question, which is a legitimate news question\n\nBiden clearly seems agitated pic.twitter.com/23OB1xyz28\n\n- Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) November 21, 2019\n\nA court-ordered paternity test concluded Hunter Biden is the father of the baby, per a report from The Daily Wire .\n\nFebruary 2020: Biden calls a college student a \"lying dog-faced pony soldier.\"\n\nAfter Biden suffered a loss in the Iowa Caucuses, a college student named Madison asked why New Hampshire voters should support him.\n\n\"You're arguably at the greatest advantage in this race. You've been the vice president ... how do you explain the performance in Iowa, and why should the voters believe that you can win a national election?\" the student asked.\n\n\"That's a good question. Number one, Iowa is a Democratic Caucus,\" Biden replied. \"You ever been to a caucus?\"\n\nThe student indicated she had.\n\n\"No you haven't,\" Biden replied. \"You're a lying dog-faced pony soldier.\"\n\n\"You said you were but now you gotta be honest. I'm gonna be honest with you,\" Biden explained. \"It was a little bit confusing in Iowa, number one. Let's assume it was all, everything was exactly right in Iowa. The idea that you come in with half the delegates that the leaders come in with in Iowa does not necessarily say how you're gonna win.\"\n\n﻿\n\nAfter the event, the student issued her own statement, reported The Daily Wire .\n\n\"A lot of what he's saying seems to be very pathos spaced and very sad,\" she said in an interview with Fox News. \"We have heard a lot about deaths and cancer and people losing their jobs and to me, he doesn't seem very solution-oriented. ...

      "text": "Trump-Supporting Dem Congressman: 'Joe Biden Is The Full-Blooded Bigot'\n\nA Democrat congressman from Georgia who has been targeted by members of his own party because he is an unabashed supporter of President Trump issued an op-ed on Tuesday in which he declared former Vice President Joe Biden a \"full-blooded bigot.\"\n\n\"Since that day in May when I announced I would support Donald Trump for president, my motives have been questioned, my integrity assailed, even my intelligence challenged. That's okay,\" wrote Georgia Rep. Vernon Jones (D) in an op-ed published by The Daily Caller . \"Since that day in May when I announced I would support Donald Trump for president, my motives have been questioned, my integrity assailed, even my intelligence challenged. That's okay. I'm a lifelong Democrat, but I am also a black man, the son of a World War II veteran and a proud American.\"\n\nJones segued to Democrats' \"absurd\" calls to defund the police, noting that he had formerly served as former Chief Executive Officer of DeKalb County, Georgia, and thus managed \"one of the largest police departments in the state.\" The \"Defund the Police\" movement, he argued, \"will only lead to more pain and suffering in our most vulnerable communities.\"\n\n\"I've had the experience of dealing with police shootings and comforting the families of victims,\" he wrote. \"But at the same time, I've also had the experience of losing two black police officers. I've had to comfort their families in the middle of the night and console their young children. I know firsthand when others are running away from chaos, police officers are running into the fight to protect and serve.\"\n\nJones opined that Trump \"was sickened by the death of George Floyd and fully committed to ensuring that he will not have died in vain.\"\n\nJones went on to laud Trump's executive order on police reform, then turned to Biden, noting that the black unemployment rate while he was vice president \"averaged a horrific 12.8 percent,\" while the number of black Americans fell by just 145,000 over eight years. \"By comparison, more than double that number - 350,000 black Americans - were lifted out of poverty during just the first two years of the Trump administration,\" Jones pointed out.\n\nJones then turned back the clock:\n\nEven before that, where was Biden for 36 years in the United States Senate on this issue? I'll tell you. He was too busy shouting \"my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle.\" That racial jungle he was referring to includes black and brown Americans like me. Right now, President Trump is being defined as a racist by the media, when in reality Joe Biden is the full-blooded bigot.\n\nDon't take my word for it, take then-Senator Joe Biden's own words for it. \"The truth is, every major crime bill since 1976 that's come out of this Congress, every minor crime bill, has had the name of the Democratic senator from the State of Delaware: Joe Biden.\" Now that Biden is running for president in a woke Democratic Party in 2020, he's attempting to sweep his racist legacy under the rug. We can't let him.\n\nJoe Biden is directly responsible for the mass incarceration policies of the 1980s and 1990s, which decimated the black community. Biden authored the 1994 crime bill which imposed mandatory minimum sentences, disproportionately putting hundreds of thousands of young black men in prison.\n\nHe closed the piece by addressing the black community. Describing Biden has having \"betrayed black Americans throughout his career\" and Trump as having \"spent his 3.5 years in office fighting to improve the lives of black Americans,\" Jones stressed, \"We cannot be tricked again\" by politicians who \"only care about black people during election years.\" ( Read Jones' full op-ed here .)\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "The Racist Legacy That Should Haunt Joe Biden\n\nAs the legacy media and others on the Left herald Joe Biden as the man who will bring about some new progressive era, they have conveniently forgotten the racist policies and actions that pockmark his political career. While the Left has spent the last four years hounding President Trump as a racist- with scant evidence - Joe Biden advocated for and wrote actual policies that may have negatively impacted minorities for decades. From his adamant stance against racial integration, his infamous crime bill, and, most recently, his insistence that \"you ain't Black\" if you don't vote for him, Biden's racist legacy as a career politician stands in stark contrast to the reputation he enjoys on the supposedly 'anti-racist' Left.\n\nHis opposition to busing over fears of a \"racial jungle\"\n\nEarly in his career as a U.S. Senator from Delaware, Biden became one of the most vocal advocates for maintaining racial segregation in all of America. He was the \"leading anti-busing crusader\" for the Democrats and found himself very much \"in league\" with staunch segregationists. According to The New York Times:\n\nHe emerged as the Democratic Party's leading anti-busing crusader - a position that put him in league with Southern segregationists, at odds with liberal Republicans and helped change the dynamic of the Senate, turning even some leaders in his own party against busing as a desegregation tool.\n\nIn an interview with CNN , Jason Sokol, a professor at the University of New Hampshire, emphasized that Biden was \"strongly opposed to busing and was very interested in the passage of the anti-busing legislation\" and that his approach \"wasn't a half-hearted thing.\"\n\nIn his opposition to integration through busing, Biden famously warned that such a policy could create a \"racial jungle\" or sorts, as detailed by David Harsanyi of the National Review :\n\nBiden might have later claimed to have 'marched in the civil-rights movement' ( he didn't ) and to have represented Black Panthers (he almost surely didn't), but in reality he was one of the leading voices in the Democratic Party opposing busing reforms. Now, we can debate the usefulness of busing, but there is no debate over whether Biden said that without 'orderly integration' his children would be growing up ' in a racial jungle .'\n\nIn a bit of irony that now borders on the absurd, vice-president-elect Kamala Harris chastised Biden's opposition toward busing during a heated debate in 2019 stating, \"There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day, and that little girl was me,\" according to CNBC .\n\nIn a television interview Biden gave in 1975 on the volatile subject, he argued that \"such steps\" as mandatory busing would be a source of greater animosity between Americans, The New York Times reported.\n\n\"This is the real problem with busing...You take people who aren't racist, people who are good citizens, who believe in equal education and opportunity, and you stunt their children's intellectual growth by busing them to an inferior school, and you're going to fill them with hatred.\"\n\n\"And what about the black student from Wilmington's east side? You send him to A.I. Dupont, bus him through Centerville every day, then send him back to the ghetto. How can he be encouraged to love his white brothers?\"\n\nHis rubbing elbows with segregationists\n\nJoe Biden's opposition to busing was surely supported at the time by segregationists around the country- some of whom Biden considered allies.\n\nHe regarded George Wallace in a positive light and \"bragged about receiving an award from... the former Alabama governor and one of America's most notorious segregationists,\" according to Rolling Stone .\n\nIn the same piece, Rolling Stone reported that Biden also once proclaimed during a campaign speech that \"we (Delawareans) were on the South's side in the Civil War.\"\n\nAs The Washington Examiner detailed, former segregationist Strom Thurmond was one of Biden's \"closest friends\" by his very own admission.\n\n\"Thurmond...ran for president in 1948 on a segregationist platform and led a record-setting filibuster to block the Civil Rights Act in 1957. He later softened his stance on civil rights issues in the 1980s but never fully renounced his position on segregation or the racially inflammatory comments he made during his presidential campaign.\"\n\nBiden even spoke at Thurmond's funeral, lauding him as great leader and man of conviction.\n\nNot surprisingly, both Biden and Thurmond were very much opposed to \"mandatory busing to desegregate schools in the 1970s and 1980s.\"\n\nIn 1975 Biden \"stunned his colleagues\" by teaming up with Jesse Helms, \"the segregationist senator from North Carolina,\" to author an \"anti-busing amendment to that year's education spending bill,\" according to The New York Times .\n\nHis 1994 Crime Bill\n\nThe inherently specious notion of \"systemic racism\" has been at the forefront of the Left's narrative these last six months and counting. Spurred on by the extremism of organizations such as Black Lives Matters and the growing prevalence of ideas such as ' Critical Race Theory,' the term is fast becoming an unfortunate and divisive cultural mainstay in our nation.\n\nIf, for the sake of argument, we concede to the idea of \"systemic racism,\" then Joe Biden was very much an architect of it for close to three decades as the author of The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Critics of his bill argue that it disproportionately targeted Black Americans and lead to their mass incarceration, according to the National Review .\n\nCritics, mostly contemporary Democrats, argue that the law helped create a mass-incarceration regime that disproportionately affects African Americans. We can debate the effectiveness of the policy, but Biden can't claim he didn't brag that the bill does 'everything but hang people for jaywalking.'\n\nThe Atlantic argued that Biden's crime bill \"helped lead to the wave of mass incarceration that's resulted in the United States accounting for 25 percent of the world's prison population.\"\n\nLenny McAllister, a Black conservative, told NPR that Biden's \"1994 crime bill disproportionately impacted [primarily Black] communities such as Homewood-Brushton where literally generations of fathers and mothers spent a disproportionate amount of time in jail.\"\n\nBiden, for his part, had little patience or sympathy for the perpetrators of crime regardless of race back in 1993 - a position diametrically opposed to the Left's current stance - stating, \"It doesn't matter whether or not they're the victims of society...I don't want to ask, 'What made them do this?' They must be taken off the street.\" Biden also gave dire warnings of \"predators in the streets\" insisting that we simply \"[l]ock the S.O.B.'s up,\" according to The New York Times .\n\nHillary Clinton echoed Biden's hardened stance in 1996 with her now-infamous and racist labeling of inner-city kids as diabolical \"super-predators\" :\n\n\"They are often the kinds of kids that are called super predators. No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.\"\n\nNow, of course, Biden has tried to walk back his tough stance on crime. While vying for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2019, he \"unveiled a plan\" aimed at \"lowering incarceration rates, ending the federal death penalty and eliminating racial disparities in how people are sentenced,\" in large part, because of the backlash against his 1994 crime bill \"that some say contributed to mass incarceration, especially of black men,\" Reuters reported.\n\n\"Under Biden's new plan, he would aim to reduce the U.S. prison population, in part by ending the jailing of people solely for drug use offenses. He would also create a $20 billion grant program to incentivize states to shift their focus from jailing people to preventing crime.\"\n\nThough a decades-long proponent of the death penalty, Biden would also \"scrap the death penalty at the federal level\" and call on states to follow suit \"by sentencing people to life without parole, rather than executing them.\"\n\n\"You ain't Black\"\n\nBiden's most recent racist gaffe occurred recently on the campaign trail. In an interview with The Breakfast Club , Biden exclaimed that anyone who voted for Trump \"ain't Black\" in his closing comments to the host: \"If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't Black.\"\n\nThe insinuation, of course, is that any minority that votes for Trump is some form of an Uncle Tom - one of the most derisive and racist accusations leveled at minorities, often by the Left.\n\nLarry Elder, a conservative and producer of the documentary, Uncle Tom , points out in a piece for the Toronto Sun that \"Democrat Identity Politics 101 dictate that Republican blacks lose their blackness, Republican women lose their gender and Republican Latinos cease being Latinos.\"\n\nOn a deeper, perhaps more insidious level, such aspersions cast by the likes of Biden point to how the Left forces minorities to either tow the progressive line or be ostracized and forced to relinquish their own identity. One is simply not allowed to have a dissenting voice as a minority on the Left without fear of reprisal.\n\nThis is often how minorities are, essentially, used by the Left to do their bidding ad nauseam as well. In an essay for Townhall , professor and scholar Walter E. Williams touches upon an oft-ignored aspect of the overarching chicanery employed by the Left toward minorities by citing a telling quote from the late controversial civil rights leader, Malcolm X:\n\nThe worst enemy that the Negro have is this white man that runs around here drooling at the mouth professing to love Negros and calling himself a liberal, and it is following these white liberals that has perpetuated problems that Negros have. If the Negro wasn't taken, tricked or deceived by the white liberal, then Negros would get together and solve our own problems. I only cite these things to show you that in America, the history of the white liberal has been nothing but a series of trickery designed to make Negros think that the white liberal was going to solve our problems...\n\nSuch a quote, even with the vitriol behind it, highlights the inherent racism behind Biden's assertion and highlights why a growing number of minorities are simply no longer willing to be duped by the Left.\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

      "text": "Black Lives Matter Leader Says Joe Biden 'Capitalized On Our Efforts To Defund The Police'\n\nA founding member of the Black Lives Matter Global Network recently accused Joe Biden of taking advantage of the movement and its ongoing drive to dismantle allegedly racially biased law enforcement agencies.\n\nDr. Melina Abdullah, lead organizer of BLM's Los Angeles chapter, said Biden \"capitalized on our efforts to defund the police, and then tried to condemn the words at the same time.\"\n\nShe made the comments on Tuesday morning while protesting outside of the residence of Democratic Mayor Eric Garcetti, the first of a series of demonstrations intended to spoil his chances for a cabinet position. Garcetti was a national co-chair of Mr. Biden's presidential campaign and has been rumored to be in the running to oversee either the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development or the Transportation Department.\n\nAlthough many Black Lives Matter leaders publicly supported Biden's candidacy, several still consider him a flawed statesman who is unwilling to push for meaningful reforms that they say would significantly improve black people's lives. For instance, Mr. Biden has said he is \"totally opposed to defunding the police officers,\" concluding, \"they need more assistance.\"\n\nNEWSFLASH: Biden & Trump are white supremacists. #blacklivesmatter #presidentialdebate pic.twitter.com/9xAInAF9UW\n\n- #BlackLivesMatter-LA (@BLMLA) October 23, 2020\n\n\"We want to be very clear that as we happily usher out the Trump regime, we will not accept liberal white supremacy in the White House in the form of Joe Biden,\" Abdullah said, later adding: \"It doesn't matter to me that Kamala Harris is your vice president if you're using her black woman body to usher in oppressive systems and oppressive people like Eric Garcetti.\"\n\nAbdullah said Biden would be \"doubling down on liberal white supremacy\" with a Garcetti appointment, accusing the mayor of criminalizing the city's homeless population while claiming that he has been too supportive of an abusive LAPD.\n\nBLM leaders believe law enforcement agencies exist to maintain a capitalist social order in America that has historically benefitted white people, which in turn is the root cause of police violence against people of color. Their plan involves gradually shifting public safety responsibilities and funding away from police departments, then reallocating that money to new services centered around meeting people's universal needs, such as housing, healthcare, and access to nutritious food.\n\nAs The Daily Wire previously reported , BLM executive director Patrisse Cullors requested a meeting with Biden and Harris earlier this month to discuss the organization's expectations and priorities.\n\n\"In short, Black people won this election,\" Cullors wrote in a letter on behalf of the BLM Global Network. \"We want something for our vote.\"\n\n\"Black people can neither afford to live through the vitriol of a Trump-like Presidency, nor through the indifference of a Democrat-controlled government that refuses to wrestle with its most egregious and damnable shame,\" she continued.\n\nCullors ended the letter by referencing Biden and Harris' records, both of whom previously supported tough-on-crime policies that have been blamed for contributing to the mass incarceration of black people. During the campaign, Biden said he made a mistake by sponsoring a 1994 crime bill signed by President Bill Clinton that put more cops in black neighborhoods and incentivized states to build more prisons. Meanwhile, Harris vowed to correct allegedly inherently racist policies within the criminal justice system, despite serving 27 years as a prosecutor enforcing harsh sentencing laws. Cullors reportedly has not yet received a response.\n\nBiden has spent his political career advocating a lock-them-up approach that feeds mass incarceration and overpolicing. @BernieSanders has been willing to get to the root of the issue...providing for people's needs reduces crime. #ReimaginePublicSafety #NotMeUs https://t.co/fazql8NZ6k\n\n- Melina Abdullah (@DocMellyMel) March 7, 2020\n\nWhile police abolitionists nationwide view Biden as a better alternative to President Donald Trump, they generally seem to have low expectations for substantial progress toward their ultimate goal. One leading scholar compared Biden's platform to \"the kind of superficial and ineffective procedural reforms that the Obama administration proposed.\" Still, they have vowed to keep the pressure on.\n\n\"We know that we had to protest Donald Trump, we had to get Donald Trump out,\" Dr. Abdullah said. \"We have to protest blatant white supremacy, but we have to remember that there's a lot of liberal white supremacists.\"\n\nRelated: Black Lives Matter Pen Letter To Joe Biden And Kamala Harris: 'We Want Something For Our Vote'\n\nRelated: Black Lives Matter-Led Drive To 'Defund The Police' Also Targets Capitalism\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

Tim Scott (R-SC) and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson both slammed presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden late last week over remarks that Biden made that were widely deemed as bigoted toward the black community.\n\nDuring an interview on \"The Breakfast Club\" with co-host Charlamagne Tha God, Biden said, \"If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.\"\n\nCarson, who is a top neurosurgeon, responded to Biden's remarks by stating: \"It is disheartening to see that some in this country still believe that African Americans are beholden to one political ideology at birth, due to the color of their skin.\"\n\nCarson added: \"In reality, ideals like the freedom of thought, resilience, and self-determination have guided the black community through the darkest of times.

      "text": "The Full Timeline Of The Fiery Candace Owens/Cardi B Feud\n\nA feud between Candace Owens and rapper Cardi B blew up Tuesday evening when the \"WAP\" singer posted a doctored tweet and made repeated false claims about Owens and her family, sparking the conservative to announce that she will \"100%\" be suing Cardi.\n\nThe feud between the pair, however, did not start on Tuesday. For years, Owens, host of The Daily Wire talk show \"Candace,\" and Cardi, real name Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, have engaged over politics and culture.\n\nJuly 2019\n\nOwens pushed-back on Cardi's public support for then-presidential candidate democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and offered to give $250,000 to a charity of the performer's choosing if she were to debate her positions against Owens or another black conservative. Cardi declined.\n\nCharity* of her choosing. Sorry @iamcardib , I was thinking of Bernie's political campaign when I typed this out.\n\n- Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) July 30, 2019\n\nWhy don't you use that 250k for a charity that will be more helpful.I like Bernie because since the 60s he's been fighting for https://t.co/HJ7iDjllir looks like progression is really his passion.I still want to ask other candidates questions that my followers would like to know. https://t.co/yucoeBJdd3\n\n- Cardi B (@iamcardib) July 30, 2019\n\nSeptember 2020\n\nOwens appeared on Ben Shapiro's \"Sunday Special\" in September and told Shapiro that his criticisms of Cardi's raunchy song \"WAP,\" or \"wet a** p****,\" were correct. Owens also hit Democrats and then-presidential candidate Joe Biden for ignoring the press but making it a point to sit down with Cardi, whom Owens called \"illiterate,\" for an interview. Owens argued that it was \"pandering\" to the black community. \" It's basically saying, 'black people, you are stupid, you are dumb,'\" she said.\n\n\"Since most black people didn't have the spine to admit that [Ben Shapiro] was 100% correct about [Cardi B] a nd how her music and platform contributes to the disintegration of black culture and values...here you go,\" Owens posted to her Twitter account, captioning a clip from the \"Sunday Special.\"\n\n\"I completely agree with your assessment about Cardi B,\" Owens told Shapiro during the show. \"It is one of the biggest insults - if black Americans are not insulted by the fact that Joe Biden, who has been hiding in his basement for the entire year, made an appearance and came out because he was gonna do an interview with Cardi B? Do we have nothing better to offer?\"\n\n\"You're pandering,\" the \"Blackout\" author said of the Democrats and Biden. \"You look at Cardi B's Instagram, you see she has millions of followers, and you think, 'okay this is an illiterate person ... they think she's cool, she's hip, just by sitting here and taking this interview, black people will vote for me.' It's basically saying, 'black people, you are stupid, you are dumb.'\"\n\nWATCH:\n\nSince most black people didn't have the spine to admit that @benshapiro was 100% correct about @iamcardib and how her music and platform contributes to the disintegration of black culture and values...here you go. #WAP #SundaySpecial pic.twitter.com/q5QxxX9G4e\n\n- Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) September 6, 2020\n\nThe post sparked a response from Cardi, who claimed she had to publicly support Biden because her song is number one, and her sister and her sister's girlfriend were allegedly \"harassed\" by a man in a \"Make America Great Again\" hat.\n\nOwens took the rapper to task about Biden's record and Cardi's incoherent comments on policy and told the \"WAP\" singer that Sanders and Biden, who've both worked with Cardi, believe she's \"dumb\" and used her.\n\nThe feud included an attack from Cardi on Owens' unborn child: \"Your baby singing wap wap wap this some dry a** p****yyy.\" This led Owens to highlight Democrats' ties to Planned Parenthood, an abortion mill founded by Margaret Sanger, a racial eugenist.\n\nNever listen to a person that has private security but wants the public police defunded. Never listen to a millionaire that made it here in America, but trashes our country. These Hollywood idols are frauds, leading sheep down paths they never took when they discovered success.\n\n- Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) September 7, 2020\n\nAmid the Twitter back and forth, Cardi took to Instagram to post a video about Owens, and Owens did the same in response.\n\n\"Joe Biden sat down with me to speak with me,\" the rapper says in the video. \"You know that interview. Two weeks ago, Fox News was really talking s*** about me too because Joe Biden sat down with me to do the interview. But let me tell you something ... why wouldn't Joe Biden want to sit down with me, Cardi B? I have millions of followers and I pay millions in taxes. I have the number one song in this country and the number one song in the United Kingdom. I have the number one song in Australia. I got the number one song in New Zealand. I'm heard all around the world. So, just like I can make people pop their p**** and have a good time and make them feel like a bad b****, I could also encourage millions of followers to go vote.\"\n\n\"Now you're saying that Joe Biden is pandering 'cause he's using a popular figure like me?\" she added. \"But your president, the guy that you f***ing love so much, he panders as well.\"\n\n\"Dear [Cardi B]. You know nothing,\" Owens captioned her post. \"Stop using your platform to call for more black deaths. Stop lying about Trump.

I'm almost six months pregnant but got the time to rip you a new WAP.\"\n\n\"You are uneducated when it comes to politics,\" Owens said in the Instagram video, adding that she did not mean to \"offend\" Cardi but believes Biden was indeed using her and think she's \"an idiot.\"\n\nOwens argued that Cardi was misusing her platform and \"hurting black America\" by echoing the myth that our police system is systemically racist and a major threat to black people. Alternatively, Owens said black communities need \"more policing\" to save black lives.\n\nThe commentator dismissed Cardi's touted \"number one song\" status with regard to politics, encouraging the rapper to \"educate\" herself on the issues, noting Cardi's \"Santa Claus list\" rattled off to Biden. \"I want this; I want this,\" Owens mocked.\n\nThe author ended the post by telling Cardi she wants to send her book \" Blackout \" to help educate her on the issues the rapper says she cares about.\n\nA post shared by Candace Owens (@realcandaceowens)\n\nOwens, soon after, told The New York Post that she loved the battle between her and Cardi. \"I love every second of this feud,\" she said. \"I was playing chess and she was playing checkers.\"\n\nThe exchange ended with memes depicting Owens' rhetorical domination of Cardi flourishing online.\n\nShe is still tweeting about me.

      "text": "Black Lives Matter Pens Letter To Joe Biden And Kamala Harris: 'We Want Something For Our Vote'\n\nThe leader of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation recently wrote a letter addressed to \"President-Elect Joe Biden and Vice-President-Elect Kamala Harris\" requesting a meeting to discuss the organization's expectations and priorities.\n\nBLM co-founder and executive director Patrisse Cullors said members are \"relieved that the Trump era in government is coming to a close,\" adding, \"As we celebrate his electoral demise, we also know that his political exit does not ensure an end to the intolerable conditions faced by Black people in America.\"\n\nThe letter was dated Saturday, November 7, the day several media outlets projected the Democratic ticket had won the presidential election. However, President Donald J. Trump has not conceded, alleging voter fraud occurred in several swing states. Attorney General William Barr on Monday authorized the Department of Justice to investigate vote irregularities before the results are certified.\n\nFull letter penned by @Blklivesmatter to @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris pic.twitter.com/Jv3G25qfXS\n\n- Black Lives Matter (BLM) (@Blklivesmatter) November 8, 2020\n\nOn behalf of the BLM Global Network, Cullors wrote :\n\nWithout the resounding support of Black people, we would be saddled with a very different electoral outcome. In short, Black people won this election. Alongside Black-led organizations around the nation, Black Lives Matter invested heavily in this election. \"Vote and Organize\" became our motto, and our electoral justice efforts reached more than 60 million voters. We want something for our vote.\n\nWe want to be heard and our agenda to be prioritized. We issue these expectations not just because Black people are the most consistent and reliable voters for Democrats, but also because Black people are truly living in crisis in a nation that was built on our subjugation. Up until this point, the United States has refused to directly reckon with the way it devalues Black people and devastates our lives. This cannot continue. Black people can neither afford to live through the vitriol of a Trump-like Presidency, nor through the indifference of a Democrat-controlled government that refuses to wrestle with its most egregious and damnable shame.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/OsopePatrisse/status/1323316604688506881\n\nCullors ended the message by referencing Biden and Harris's records, both of whom previously supported tough-on-crime policies that have been blamed for contributing to the mass incarceration of Black people. During the campaign, Biden said he made a mistake by supporting President Bill Clinton's 1994 crime bill that put more cops in Black neighborhoods and incentivized states to construct more prisons. Meanwhile, Harris vowed to correct racially biased policies within the criminal justice system, despite serving 27 years as a prosecutor enforcing harsh sentencing laws.\n\n\"The best way to ensure that you remedy past missteps and work towards a more just future for Black people - and by extension all people - is to take your direction from Black grassroots organizers that have been engaged in this work for decades with a legacy that spans back to the first arrival of enslaved Africans,\" wrote Cullors.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, \"the BLM network banked millions of dollars from a surge of donations\" that followed nationwide protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man who died on May 25 while in the custody of Minneapolis police officers. Cullors established a fund of more than $12 million, the outlet reported. Affiliated BLM chapters are eligible to apply for grants to advance local efforts, such as defunding police departments.\n\nT he Daily Wire is one of America's fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

      "text": "Why His Support For The 1994 Crime Bill Won't Hurt Joe Biden - Yet\n\nYesterday, President Trump took to Twitter to deride Joe Biden for his work on the 1994 Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act. Trump insinuated that Biden's support of the bill, which imposed steep sentencing guidelines and some of Biden's presidential opponents have criticized, would keep black voters from supporting him.\n\nAnyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected. In particular, African Americans will not be able to vote for you. I, on the other hand, was responsible for Criminal Justice Reform, which had tremendous support, & helped fix the bad 1994 Bill!\n\n- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 27, 2019\n\nIt's hard to understand the president's exact political motivation here. Maybe he thinks the crime bill is a serious stumbling block for Biden in the primary and wants to elevate it as an issue, playing political adviser to Biden's opponents, as it were. Maybe he thinks he can force Biden to double down on his support of the crime bill, and alienate the social justice wing of the party in a general election. Maybe he's just stirring the pot.\n\nWhatever he's doing, the crime bill is not going to take Biden down. Not yet, anyway.\n\nThe reason Biden is safe on this front is generational. Basically, if you are more than 40 years old, you might think the bill was draconian, but you can remember how bad the crime crisis was in 1994. If you are younger than 40, and have no such recollection, it may very well seem like a needless and reactionary measure. Most of the electorate is older than 40. They have a context for Biden's choice that makes it seem, even if one disagrees with it, entirely understandable.\n\nPollster Frank Luntz weighed in on this question in response to me on Twitter today.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/FrankLuntz/status/1133432709458456577\n\nAnd he's right. In 1993, for example, there were more than 2,400 murders in New York City. Last year there were 289. It is impossible to explain to a 30-year-old what 1993 New York City was like - don't get me wrong, I still loved it, and moved there - but it was often legitimately frightening. This was a pattern seen all across the country. And the voters were demanding solutions.\n\nThere is widespread disagreement about how effective the crime bill and New York City's \"broken windows\" policing methods were in the staggering crime rate drop that followed their enforcement. I won't litigate that here, except to say that whatever role they played, violent crime dropped dramatically. The important point is that whether they worked or not, people understand why they were adopted, and they had broad public and political support across demographic boundaries.\n\nThis will be Biden's play: \"It was a crisis,\" \"The public demanded action,\" \"It had broad support, including among black politicians.\" For the vast majority of voters of all ages, this makes sense and makes his support of the bill into something of a nothingburger. In terms of the Democratic primary, this line of attack seems unlikely to leave much of a mark. But the general election is a different story.\n\nIf, as may have been Trump's hope, Biden has to double down on his defense of the bill, it will anger parts of the far-left Democratic base. I think Trump is either wrong, or trying to be edgy about whom those voters are. It's not black voters that the crime bill is likely to influence, it is white progressives, who make up the vast majority of far-left New Progressives. But this can still work in Trump's favor. Frankly, it's reminiscent of what happened to Hillary Clinton, who could not bring along enough Sanders voters to beat Trump.\n\nTrump's tweet is his most powerful direct intervention into the Democratic primary to date. It is a reality show challenge. How will each contestant deal with it? Will a desperate single-digit long shot take up the president's critique and call Biden unfit? Or will one of them try to appeal to the center by getting Biden's back? Bernie Sanders also voted for the bill as a member of Congress, so how does that affect the game?\n\nOne of the more telling moments of the 2016 election was when Bill Clinton, apparently against his advisors' wishes, engaged a young Sanders supporter in a diner in New Mexico who criticized his administration. At one point, Bubba said, \"If you never have to make a decision, then you can go back to the past and cherry pick everything[for a narrative] that is blatantly false.\" It was an awkward moment for the Hillary Clinton campaign that wished to divorce itself to some degree from Bill's legacy.\n\nBut what if that was a mistake by Hillary's team? What if it was the same mistake Al Gore made? What if  lots and lots of people, including Democrats who aren't on CNN or Twitter, still believe Clinton was a good president? Then Biden might be making a very shrewd choice to defend the 1990s Democratic Party in the primary.\n\nBut for some progressives it might be a bridge too far. And that is why Trump wants this to be an issue.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "'Defunding The Police' Is Ridiculous. Here's How To Do Real Police Reform\n\nBy the time I heard a local activist leader shout that he had brought a group of protesters outside my house to make my children, wife, and neighbors \"uncomfortable,\" I had mostly given up on the idea that meaningful systemic changes would come out of the movement sparked by the brutal murder of George Floyd.\n\nI am an African American man who grew up in rough neighborhoods in Dallas during the most violent period of our nation's history. Before I became mayor, I had successfully pushed for police accountability measures and expanded educational opportunities during my nine years in the Texas legislature. I was raising two black boys in America (and have added a daughter since then). I was horrified by the death of George Floyd. And Eric Garner. And Philando Castile. And Tamir Rice. And Michael Brown. And on and on.\n\nBut like many of my fellow mayors across the country, I had become the enemy because I didn't believe in slashing the budget of our police department - which had already shrunk by hundreds of officers during the previous five years - amid staggering increases in violent crime in Dallas.\n\nThe movement, which began with bipartisan support and captured hearts and minds across the country in a way I had never before seen, was hijacked by elitist and extremist talk of \"defunding\" or \"dismantling.\" The loudest voices eschewed common ground and common sense, opting for sloganeering and an air of insatiability that repelled rather than persuaded. Many positive changes, including better use-of-force policies, came out of the movement, but many other opportunities have been squandered.\n\nIt didn't have to be that way. And it still doesn't.\n\nCities and states can implement programs now that provide for equity, improve policing, and make us less reliant on law enforcement to solve every social ill. And the federal government could support these ideas through a 21st-century crime bill. Whereas the 1994 Crime Bill centered on punishment, a new plan could focus on prevention and policing.\n\nNow is the time to take action in a comprehensive way. Violent crime is up across the country, and underserved communities and minorities are disproportionately the victims. They deserve safety and justice. During the pandemic, I was a member of the National Commission on COVID-19 and Criminal Justice, and we collected data that showed aggravated assault rates in the United States increased 7 percent, gun assault rates went up by 22 percent, and homicides spiked by 24 percent. In Dallas, the numbers were even higher.\n\nPolice can help stop violent crime and bring criminals to justice. Over and over, defunding activists claimed that police only show up after a crime is committed - an absurd notion that suggests all crimes are just one-offs and that there is no such thing as repeat offenders and no need for detectives.\n\nThere are bad people in this world. Maybe some people could have been saved and still can be once they are in the criminal justice system. But once they victimize someone, they must be stopped. That's why we need police, and why defunding - whatever it means - is a mistake. We also need solutions that reduce our dependence on law enforcement and prevent crimes from occurring in the first place.\n\nHere is how we can fight crime and make our police departments better and more responsive.\n\nDemand and develop crime reduction plans. Every city's police chief should have an annual strategic plan to reduce violent crime and to engage the community. This may seem simple, but when I became mayor in June 2019, it became apparent that the police brass of the ninth-largest city in the country simply didn't have a comprehensive crime-reduction plan. I had to demand one.\n\nThat also meant that policymakers had nothing on which they could base resource allocation decisions and had no real way to assess accountability or let their constituents know what steps were being taken or why. Accountability must start at the top.\n\nOffer competitive pay for police. Simply put, you get what you pay for. Policing poses many potential dangers for both suspects and the police, and the pay isn't always commensurate with the risks and skills required to do the job.\n\nIn 2019, we supported market-based pay increases in Dallas after years of losing some of our best young officers, whom we paid to train, to growing suburban cities with salaries that were $10,000-$15,000 a year more than what we offered. If we want good community policing, we must set high standards and pay accordingly.\n\nImprove accountability measures . Those who can't meet those expectations need to find other work. The stakes are too high. A civilian police oversight board can be an important way to hold our police officers accountable.\n\nWe have enhanced ours in Dallas and hired a monitor to help review cases and recommend policy changes in line with evolving community expectations. We also need to double down on body cameras, which have allowed prosecutors, grand juries, juries, and the public to cut through the noise and see issues more clearly.\n\nExpand training for police officers. Those cameras also give police something that has been used for decades in sports: game film. Video is an important training tool. And training must be intensive.\n\nPolice are expected to think like lawyers, criminologists, psychologists, and athletes. No police department worth its salt should be adhering to only the minimum prescribed state standards as they exist now. Boost the requirements, give the best available training, and correct mistakes.\n\nAddress environmental factors that cause crime . In August 2019, I formed the Mayor's Task Force on Safe Communities to make recommendations for policies that could reduce crime without the involvement of law enforcement. After reviewing policies in some other cities, the Task Force recommended improving lighting and remediating blight in high-crime areas.\n\nCrime tends to exist where criminals believe no one is watching and that no one cares. We need to eliminate havens for violence. We have begun implementing these recommendations through our newly formed Office of Integrated Public Safety Solutions, and the early returns have been promising. Cities should move swiftly on place-based crime reduction strategies that don't involve law enforcement.\n\nProvide counseling services, early and often . My Task Force on Safe Communities also recommended two policies aimed at changing behaviors: implementing social and emotional learning (SEL) curriculum in schools and employing violence interrupters in targeted neighborhoods. Both programs are meant to help people learn to deal with conflict in nonviolent ways.\n\nWe recently hired Youth Advocate Programs to run a violence interrupter program, and other cities have started similar programs. And Dallas ISD has expanded its SEL program, which has produced positive results.\n\nHandle mental health calls the right way. Police are not equipped well enough to deal with mental health emergencies. In Dallas, we have created and expanded our RIGHT (Rapid Integrated Group Healthcare Team) Care program, which deploys mental health professionals to calls, accompanied by police. Other cities have similar programs. They are worth the cost and help cities deal with their most vulnerable residents in a caring and understanding way.\n\nCreate and expand summer jobs programs . These programs are primarily meant to give young people some money and teach them life and job skills. But they also help reduce crime. One federally funded 2017 study showed that New York City's Summer Youth Employment program participants were 17 percent less likely to be arrested during the summer and 23 percent less likely to be arrested for a felony. In Dallas, we are scaling up my summer jobs program for youth called Dallas Works and hope to see similar results.\n\nThese are real solutions that do not require defunding or dismantling anything. They are about building for a better future.\n\nThey also reflect the on-the-ground reality that mayors deal with every day. We know very well that public safety is our residents' top priority. We know that our residents must feel safe to thrive and that they want to be able to call 911 and get an appropriate response when they're in a crisis. We can't expect people to strive for the American dream if they can't sleep safely and comfortably. And we can't expect people to feel safe if they don't have trust in our police officers to correctly respond to difficult situations.\n\nThe status quo isn't working for many people. It's not working for crime victims or for the victims of police brutality. We can and must do better for them and for our children. And in this country that has seen too many divisions, we must do it in a way that brings people together.\n\nRepublished from RealClearPolicy, with permission.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Legalizing Drugs And Opening The Border Will Only Worsen Our Nation's Addiction Crisis\n\nAs the nation prepares for the incoming Biden-Harris administration the new president promises will be \"the most progressive in history,\" many drug policy practitioners wonder with trepidation what this will mean for the country's drug crisis.\n\nRecord levels of methamphetamine, heroin, and fentanyl, not to mention surging tonnage of cocaine and black market marijuana, are pouring across our borders at the hands of ruthless Mexican drug cartels, directly fueling ever-increasing overdose deaths and crime. So leftists' stated objectives and record on drugs and crime should worry all Americans.\n\nWe can get a preview of the new administration's more \"nuanced\" counterdrug approach by examining \"The Biden Plan to End the Opioid Crisis\" from the campaign. It doesn't look promising. Long on therapeutic programs and short on reducing drug availability through border security and targeting drug trafficking organizations, it boldly declares that \"Biden will tackle this crisis by making sure people have access to high quality health care.\"\n\nIt also proudly calls for an incomprehensible $125 billion in additional spending to \"make prevention, treatment and recovery services available to all,\" which will accomplish little more than expanding the already bloated government-sponsored compassion industry. Bowing to the far left wing of the party, the Biden plan also promises to \"reform the criminal justice system so that no one is incarcerated for drug use alone\"-a debunked myth.\n\nVirtually no one goes to prison for simply using drugs, especially at the federal level. According to a 2015 study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, only about 16 percent of our state prisoners are there for drug offenses-nearly all for distribution. Drug possession accounts for only 3.6 percent of the total. Federally, nearly all drug offenders (99.5 percent) are serving time for major trafficking.\n\nThe incessant cry from the radical left (and often the libertarian right) that \"the war on drugs has failed\" has lately been destructively amplified with demands to \"defund,\" or \"abolish,\" or even \"f-ck the police.\" Their misguided and malicious charges that U.S. law enforcement professionals are the principal perpetrators of \"systemic racism\" and \"mass incarceration\" reveal a breathtaking ignorance about what is required to maintain safety and order on the mean streets of modern America.\n\nSuch reckless slogans by the far-left wing of the Democrat Party have been matched with equally reckless action. From House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's repeated attempts to legalize marijuana at the federal level-most recently by passing the MORE Act in the House of Representatives on Dec. 4-to Oregon decriminalizing the possession of even heroin and methamphetamine at the state level, to Seattle sponsoring \"safe-injection sites\" for heroin users across the city, such catastrophic actions mainly serve to demonstrate how enlightened, sophisticated and caring leftist leaders are in their approach to the drug war.\n\nAttempting to excuse or medicalize the entire drug crisis, while vilifying the police for \"filling our prisons with drug users,\" not only makes the problem worse, but undermines the ability of our criminal justice system to reduce the predatory behavior of individuals and organizations that seek to prey upon our fellow citizens for profit.\n\nTo argue that the drug problem should be solved therapeutically, not criminally, simply because it involves the \"medical\" problem of addiction, ignores the role that drug availability plays in developing and expanding new markets. Would one make the same argument in attempting to deal with the trafficking of child pornography by pursuing only treatment and prevention programs for the addicted?\n\nFew remember that when President Nixon declared his \"war against drugs\" in 1971, his principal weapon in our national struggle was actually drug treatment. Recognizing the need to reduce the alarming rise of drug use in our society, Nixon increased drug treatment funding eight-fold within two years, consuming nearly two-thirds of our total federal drug control budget.\n\nBut the president-and the country-came to learn the limitations of government's ability to affect behavior solely through therapeutic means. Without the ability to compel drug users into long-term treatment, most attempts at drug treatment failed miserably and repeatedly-an outcome that largely continues today.\n\nLandmark research from Boston University in 2006 and detailed in the Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment put the mean number of drug treatment episodes at 6.9 times over a six-and-one-half-year period. Additionally, the National Institutes of Health published findings in 2010 which revealed that more than 90 percent of opioid users tragically returned to their drug use following treatment, most within one week. That's why they call it a \"chronic, relapsing condition.\"\n\nSo, too, with drug prevention. Drug policy expert Mark Kleiman from New York University has written that, although we so want to believe in its efficacy (after all, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure) \"the hard scientific evidence concerning drug prevention\" has shown completely \"underwhelming results.\" He further notes, \"Even the best prevention programs have only modest effects on actual behavior, and many programs have no effect at all on drug use.\"\n\nWe have learned through experience that, although drug prevention and treatment programs must continue to be made available and improved upon through evidence-based practices in order to help at the margins, government's role-not that of society-at-large, but government -can make the greatest positive impact by reducing drug availability. That is, interdicting drug shipments and arresting, prosecuting, and imprisoning drug dealers.\n\nIn fact, over the long-term, given the continuing limited success of treatment and prevention programs, drug enforcement may be the most effective, and compassionate, anti-drug program available to us today.\n\nIt has been perplexing to see former senator Biden denounce the 1994 Crime Bill-one he helped draft, and that received overwhelming support from the Congressional Black Caucus and the African American community-to pander to radical, anti-law and order groups demanding the dangerously unrealistic nullification of our police.\n\nThe Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 was a direct response to the explosion of crime and violence that accompanied the crack scourge across the country in the late '80s and early '90s, one that incontrovertibly caused homicide rates in most of our cities to intolerably spike to record levels in 1993. That is, until now.\n\nThanks to a deadly combination of sentimental, i.e., \"woke,\" ideologies that excuse criminal behavior, combined with new and ever-more potent and addictive drugs flooding into our communities, homicide numbers are breaking new records across the land this year.\n\nFinal national murder update of 2020:\n\nMurder up 36.7% in 57 agencies with data through at least September (though most have data through November). Murder up in 51 of 57, 37 of 58 agencies reporting murder up more than 30%.\n\nSpreadsheet here: https://t.co/vEhKHuFNrY pic.twitter.com/5HgVmwGmDS\n\n- Jeff Asher (@Crimealytics) December 29, 2020\n\nWe didn't treat or prevent our way out of the crack epidemic. Those programs helped, but we gained the upper hand by enforcing legitimate and reasonable state, federal, and international laws against illegal drugs.\n\nFrom multilateral efforts targeting cocaine labs in South America, to enhanced Caribbean interdiction operations, right down to taking back our communities from the violent gangs and dealers who constituted the foot soldiers of the cartels, it was our collective national will to do what was necessary, however distasteful to some, to rescue our society from catastrophe. One can only hope we can muster such a will again, or the consequences will be dire.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

He said it ... 1994, the crime bill. Super predators.\"\n\nBiden immediately denied the claim on stage.\n\n\"I never, ever said what he accused me of saying,\" Biden said.\n\nDuring a speech on the Senate floor in 1993 however, Biden warned of \"predators on our streets\" that were \"beyond the pale.\"\n\n\"They must be taken off the street,\" Biden said. \"Unless we do something about that cadre of young people, tens of thousands of them born out of wedlock without parents, without supervision, without any structure, without any conscience developing ... we should focus on them now ... they will, or a portion of them will become the predators 15 years from now, and madam president we have predators on our streets.\"\n\nMedia fact-checkers flocked to the defense of their preferred presidential candidate, including CNN's Daniel Dale, a predictable culprit .\n\nBiden never used the phrase \"super predators.\" (That was Hillary Clinton.)

Cory Booker last summer.\n\nBiden's crime bill was responsible for investing billions of federal dollars into the contemporary prison industrial complex giving Trump, who passed criminal justice reform in 2018 more credibility on the issue than his Democratic opponent less than two weeks before election day.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Biden: 'Sometimes Even George Wallace Is Right'\n\nIn 1981, Joe Biden argued that segregationist George Wallace's positions on criminal justice, rehabilitation, and the death penalty were prophetic.\n\nHow many Republican candidates could survive a 2020 political race if they had once said, \"sometimes even George Wallace is right about some things?\" I'd venture to say none.\n\nIn his email newsletter , CNN's Chris Cillizza ranks the five big campaign stories to keep an eye on. Coming in at No. 1 this week is whether presidential hopeful Joe Biden can turn over a \"new leaf.\" The former vice president, Cillizza explained, \"sought to put a rough few weeks, which began with what was interpreted as praise for segregationist senators, behind him.\"\n\nWere Biden's comments about the relative civility of segregationists interpreted as praise of segregationists-as in, still up for debate-or was it just unadorned praise? Whatever the case, reporters now have a catalog of historical evidence showing Biden extolling segregationists, defending segregationists, eulogizing segregationists, working with segregationists on shared interests, being mentored by segregationists, and sucking up to segregationists to secure coveted committee seats as a freshman senator-appointments that he was given over more experienced colleagues.\n\nWhat more do journalists need to see to make a declarative statement about Biden's history? I mean, other than finding an \"R\" next to his name.\n\nWhat about Biden telling a witness \"sometimes even George Wallace is right\" during a Senate committee hearing in 1981?\n\nNo, Biden wasn't arguing that Wallace - the notorious four-term Democrat governor of Alabama and three-time segregationist presidential candidate who, in 1963, had famously said, \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\" - was a good guy, as he did of his \"closest friend,\" Strom Thurmond. By the time Biden was bringing up Wallace, in fact, the Alabama governor had asked for forgiveness. Biden was arguing that Wallace's argument about criminal justice, rehabilitation, and the death penalty-positions that are now abhorrent to progressives-had been prophetic.\n\n\"Let us take the death penalty,\" Biden explained. \"Everybody wants the death penalty now. We are going to hang everybody. Do you know why they want the death penalty? Because stupid sociologists and guys like people who sit up here in my job for years kept telling them: 'We know how to rehabilitate.' They do not have the slightest idea how to rehabilitate. Our entire criminal justice system is premised on the point that you sentence someone based upon the amount of time it will take to rehabilitate them.\n\n\"So the American people,\" he went on, \"because they are basically good, like most people in my opinion are, went along and said: 'We'll buy that.' And they bought it for 20 years. And it does not work. It flat out does not work. So, what are the liberals, but Joe Biden and a few others like me, saying? And I get killed by my liberal constituency for saying it. I say: 'Hey, let's forget about rehabilitation. We do not know how to do it.' Say it. Boom. Tell them. Because if you don't, you know what is going to happen.\"\n\n(None of the above, incidentally, had anything to do with the topic of the Senate hearing Biden was charged with running, which was the constitutionality of busing.)\n\nCasting himself as a rebellious Democrat, Biden argued that Americans were going to get so frustrated with the \"liberal sociologists and politicians\" that they would turn to Thurmond's view of \"hang them all,\" not because Americans were bad people, but because urban liberal policies had failed them.\n\nSo maybe Biden wasn't always wrong.\n\nThen again, the future vice president also argued that our criminal justice problems only existed because the American people were \"not very innovative.\" This assertion was made with United States on the cusp of a technological and economic revolution that benefited every strata of society and changed the world of information and commerce forever. So there's also that.\n\nDoes Biden believe rehabilitation is overrated? Who are we kidding? Biden believes whatever he needs to believe to win-then and now. He will drop decades-long positions if they offer the slightest threat to his campaign, without any intellectual or moral explanation.\n\nWe know this because, despite his insistence at the time, there was nothing particularly courageous about being a law-and-order senator from Delaware in 1981. In that year, 66 percent of Americans supported the death penalty . By the time Biden was pushing the 1994 crime bill, that number had climbed to 80 percent. Biden was adopting popular positions in a nation sick of rampant criminality.\n\nThings have changed, though, and Biden has already apologized for his part in passing the 1994 crime bill. \"It was a big mistake that was made,\" he explained. \"We were told by the experts that 'Crack, you never go back,' that the two were somehow fundamentally different. It's not. But it's trapped an entire generation.\"\n\nYou'll notice that here Biden drops his customary habit of taking personal credit for policy achievements, even ones that he was only tangentially involved in during the Obama administration, and instead lays the blame on the collective. Policies that Biden sponsored, helped write, and campaigned on for decades, are now - well, mistakes were made.\n\nJoe \" lock those SOBs up \" Biden contends that he was part of a group fooled by pointy-headed experts and \"Crack is Wack\" slogans. You might notice this was the very same rationalization he used in his Wallace-was-right lecture to make the contradictory point about crime in 1981. Experts misled us.\n\nThat's all debatable. Maybe Biden was just doing what he had to do in 1970s Washington. Maybe Biden was right about busing and crime, and needed some unsavory allies to stop bad policy. Maybe he buddied up with James O. Eastland and J. William Fulbright for the long-term good, and maybe it was worth it. Maybe Wallace had a point. Maybe it's all just ancient history.\n\nBut that brings us back to the central argument of the Biden campaign: if his experience in Washington is the most compelling reason for his candidacy, why does he spend so much time apologizing and walking back positions, policy choices, and statements? These are not all inconsequential, long-forgotten fights, either. We're talking about some of the biggest debates of the past 50 years. War. Abortion. Integration of schools. Crime.\n\nDoes Biden deserve a pass simply because he said these things a long time ago? If not, perhaps someone at the next debate can ask him if he still believes Wallace was right.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Biden Muddles Through Gentle, Hunter-Free Town Hall\n\nBiden's softball town hall did not instill confidence.\n\nJoe Biden came into Thursday night's town hall, which was originally supposed to be a debate, stung by new allegations of influence-peddling involving his son Hunter. The question on everyone's mind going in was whether he would be allowed to answer any question harder than chocolate or tapioca? With social media strangling the Hunter story from the New York Post, the nation's oldest continuous daily newspaper, and Twitter going dark after criticism, it was up to old media, ABC News, to act responsibly and ask the question.\n\nJoe appeared with Greek heartthrob George Stephanopoulos. They started off with a question from a Democrat who was dismayed by Trump's response to COVID-19. What would Biden have done differently? Now listen, carefully. He wanted more access to China; so did Trump. After that? Biden wrote a USA op-ed. But he can point to nothing he would have done substantively differently from Trump's response. Nothing. This is important. According to Democrats, Trump killed 200,000 people, but they can't say what they would have done differently.\n\nBiden's big plan going forward seems to be a mix of big signs about masks in stores, ventilation systems, and bearing the example of wearing a mask. On vaccines, Biden referred to the body of scientists, whatever that means, and said that if they said it was OK, he would take it. But he reminded us that Trump lies and we should be careful.\n\nJoe Biden insisted that as president he would spend a lot of time telling governors, mayors, and maybe even city councilmen, \"Wear a mask!\" \"Mandate masks!\" He then suggested that kids are in danger. Joe was waving his mask around the whole time, but he wasn't providing a lot of evidence.\n\nLucky Joe just happened to have some kind of card in his pocket when he was asked by a Trump supporter about eliminating middle-class tax cuts Trump provided. Joe kept referring to the card - not without difficulty - but didn't really answer the question. And heartthrob George, instead of pressing Biden on taking away middle-class tax cuts, asked if it's really fair to tax the rich. He didn't just put the ball on the tee, he grabbed Biden by the hips and said, \"swing.\"\n\nA young, progressive, black voter asked if Biden would change the racist systems in America. Biden talked about funding, funding for education. He did not address the fact that some of our best-funded schools are some of our worst, especially in vulnerable communities. It was a saccharine repetition of generations of failure.\n\nBiden insisted in regard to his support of the 1994 crime bill that he does not think drug addicts should go to jail. He thinks they should go into mandatory rehab - presumably in Ukraine on business travel. There were promises of talking to black and brown people. Biden also said police should \"shoot them in the leg,\" instead of shooting to kill in self-defense. He is very cavalier about the lives of law enforcement officers.\n\nBiden was very gently asked if the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett as a Supreme Court justice would open the door to establishing \"guardrails\" to protect the judicial system. Yeah, that was the question on whether he would pack the Supreme Court. No question, no answer - exactly what ABC News intended. Biden defended his position by referring to arguments between scholars. When pressed, Biden said he wants a slow debate process in the Senate or else he will consider packing the court.\n\nShockingly, we got a question from a disaffected Republican who doesn't like Trump. Thank God ABC News found one of these 57 people or so who exist in the world. The question was how will Biden be more civil? It was a trash bag of nonsense that had no place in a serious town hall. It was the breadcrumbs in a very disappointing meatball.\n\nWhat didn't come up was Hunter Biden. What didn't come up was credible claims from the New York Post, the oldest daily newspaper in America, showing that the former vice president met with a Ukrainian businessman connected to his son. The biggest story in America right now was just ignored. That tells us pretty much everything.\n\nThis was really sad. It was sad in the way that old baseball players used to suit up and do old-timers games. This was an old-timer game. Biden put on his uniform and took batting practice, and he didn't take it all that well. Biden was a back-up in the Obama administration, and making him the starter isn't looking like a great bet.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "What To Make Of Biden's Latest Call For Banning Guns\n\nLast week, asked what he planned to do about crime, Joe Biden said \"I'm the only guy that ever got passed legislation, when I was a senator, to make sure we eliminated assault weapons. The idea (that) you need a weapon that can have the ability to fire 20, 30, 40, 50, 120 shots from that weapon, whether it's a nine-millimeter pistol or whether it's a rifle, is ridiculous. I'm continuing to push to eliminate the sale of those things.\" Any gun can fire 20 shots, of course, and Biden has never been articulate, so it would be fair to assume that he meant \"fire 20 shots without reloading .\"\n\nOnline, a disagreement about what Biden meant ensued between House Republicans and PolitiFact. But before getting into that, three things should be noted. First, as has often been the case during his political career, in this instance Biden lied. The legislation Biden bragged about-Sen. Dianne Feinstein's, D-California, gun and magazine \"ban\" of 1994-2004, imposed as part of Biden's 1994 crime bill-didn't \"eliminate\" any guns.\n\nThe \"ban\" didn't apply to the possession of guns already owned. On paper, it banned the importation of semi-automatic firearms it defined as \"assault weapons,\" but the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) had already done that in 1989, as ordered by President George H. W. Bush, with the blessing of Bush's \"drug czar,\" Bill Bennett.\n\nFeinstein's ban applied to the manufacture of such firearms, but unintentionally allowed manufacturers to keep making the firearms in modified form. As a result, during the \"ban,\" Americans bought almost three-quarters of a million newly made AR-15s, and no telling how many rifles of similar orientation.\n\nSix months after the \"ban\" took effect, in a CBS \"60 Minutes\" segment titled \"What Assault Weapons Ban?,\" reporter Lesley Stahl called 1994 \"the best year for the sales of assault weapons ever.\" Frustrated, Feinstein told Stahl, \"There is no question that I would have preferred to see an outright ban on the possession of semi-automatic assault weapons in America\" and \"if I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America turn them all in, I would have done it. I could not do that. The votes weren't there.\"\n\nSecond, since 1989, Democrats' federal gun- and magazine-ban legislation, the first of which was introduced by purported communist Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Arizona, has defined such magazines as any that can hold 11 or more rounds of ammunition. Therefore Biden was trying to mislead, saying he wanted to ban guns that can fire \"20\" or more shots.\n\nThird, while firearms that Democrats call \"assault weapons\" are used in only 2-3 percent of murders (compared to about 30 percent of murders without firearms of any type), no use of a gun in crime is grounds for banning it, because the right to keep and bear arms is constitutionally protected and, as the Supreme Court said in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), \"the enshrinement of constitutional rights necessarily takes certain policy choices off the table.\"\n\nBesides, as the late Jeff Cooper, considered the founder of the modern defensive handgun technique, said in \"The Art Of The Rifle,\" rifles \"may be used by evil men for evil purposes, but there are more good men than evil, and while the latter cannot be persuaded to the path of righteousness by propaganda, they can certainly be corrected by good men with rifles.\"\n\nWhile there is nothing in the legislative history of the Second Amendment to support Heller's claim that the right to arms includes only such arms as are \"in common use\" for legitimate purposes, AR-15s, comparable rifles, and handguns that can use magazines that hold 11 or more rounds are the firearms most in common use for such purposes today. For example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, in Kolbe v. Hogan (2017), said \"in 2012, the number of AR- and AK-style weapons . . . was more than double the number of Ford F-150 trucks sold, the most commonly sold vehicle in the United States.\"\n\nHowever, for the record, violent crime, which began declining several years before Feinstein's \"ban\" was imposed, continued to decline as purchases of those firearms in particular, and firearms generally, increased. And since the \"ban\" expired in 2004, Americans have bought millions more AR-15s, comparable rifles, semi-automatic pistols, and hundreds of millions of magazines that hold 11 or more rounds for those firearms. Also, until Democrat officials stopped prosecuting rioters and began defunding police departments, the U.S. murder rate had declined.\n\nIn response to Biden's statement, House Republicans, overlooking that Biden said he supported banning rifles that can fire 20 or more shots, said on Twitter, \"Biden says he wants to ban handguns.\" \"Handguns\" could be interpreted as meaning \"some handguns\" or \"all handguns,\" so PolitiFact assumed the latter and said Republicans' claim was \"false.\" It added, \"Biden doesn't want to ban handguns, Biden wants to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. . . . The most popular handguns would face no restrictions under Biden's policies.\"\n\nAdding to the confusion, two conservative websites quoted Biden without including his first sentence, with which, it could be argued, he put the remainder of his statement in the context of \"assault weapons.\" Both websites, like the Republicans, ignored Biden's claim relative to banning rifles.\n\nPolitiFact was particularly wrong in claiming Biden's policies would have no effect on the most popular handguns. The most popular handguns today are those that use detachable magazines, detachable magazines are integral parts of firearms designed to use them (like a gas tank is to a car), firearms that can use detachable magazines can use ones of any size, magazines of 11 rounds or more are made for most of them, and magazines of 20 rounds are made for many of them.\n\nIn the 1800s, Democrats imposed state laws designed to prevent blacks from being armed. In 1934, a Democrat Congress and President Franklin D. Roosevelt (who threatened to pack the Supreme Court and threw Japanese-Americans in internment camps) imposed the National Firearms Act. In 1968, a Democrat Congress and President Lyndon B. Johnson (who campaigned for universal gun registration and gun owner licensing) imposed the Gun Control Act, which, among other things, prohibited a firearm dealer from selling a handgun to a young adult, prohibited a dealer from selling a handgun to a resident of another state, and limited the importation of firearms to those the BATFE considers \"generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes\" (emphasis added).\n\nIn 1974, thinking they had momentum and seeing the opportunity to rake in cash by sending fundraising letters to hoplophobic leftists, anti-gun activists formed the National Coalition to Ban Handguns and the National Council to Control Handguns (NCCH, later renamed Handgun Control, Inc., or HCI). In 1975, NCCH called for \"a ban on the manufacture, sale, and importation of all handguns and handgun ammunition,\" and in 1976 advocated a law \"to make the possession of all handguns and all handgun ammunition . . . totally illegal.\"\n\nInto the 1980s, both groups campaigned in particular for a ban on compact handguns which, at the time, typically held six or fewer rounds of ammunition. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, of Chappaquiddick infamy, and Rep. Peter Rodino, D-New Jersey, introduced the necessary legislation.\n\nIn 1991, a future president of HCI told the New York Assembly's Committee on Codes, \"There is no reason why a legitimate gun owner needs to have a clip (sic) capable of holding more than six rounds, and thus I would suggest the banning of clips (sic) that hold more than six rounds.\" Coupled with a ban on compact handguns holding six rounds or fewer, a ban on magazines holding more than six rounds would have begun to look a lot like a ban on handguns.\n\nTwo years later, even six rounds was too many. In 1993, Feinstein told the Senate, \"I intend to add an amendment that would exempt semi-automatic bolt action (sic) shotguns and bona fide hunting rifles whose clips (sic) don't exceed three rounds.\"\n\nSince Democrats have worked toward civilian disarmament for more than a century, Biden's latest comment about banning guns and magazines should come as no surprise.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Why Anita Hill's Grudge Against Joe Biden Could Be His Achilles' Heel\n\n\"Joe Biden in Salem - May 16th\" by Barack Obama is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\n\nThe rollout of Joe Biden's third presidential campaign went about as well as he could have hoped. Despite his lackluster performances in the campaign debut video and some of his first speeches since declaring his candidacy, Biden raised impressive amounts of money and saw his already strong poll numbers go up once he entered the ranks of the already swollen Democratic presidential field.\n\nWith the current RealClearPolitics average of polls showing him with a 39 to 15.5 percent lead over Bernie Sanders and with the rest of the field only in single digits, Biden deserves the title of early Democratic frontrunner. Unfortunately for him, Biden has a problem named Anita Hill.\n\nBiden carries an enormous amount of political baggage after almost a half-century in Washington politics. His opposition to forced busing for desegregation in the 1970s is heresy in today's intersectional Democratic Party, where identity politics is the coin of the realm. His championing of the 1994 crime bill that is credited with massively increasing the number of African-Americans who have been incarcerated is just as much of a problem for the same reason.\n\nBut unlike those issues, Biden's Anita Hill problem is embodied in a person rather than a talking point. Since, as Hill recently told The New York Times, she has not been mollified by his recent expression of \"regret\" (but not an apology) for his conduct toward her in 1991 when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings, that could create the kind of obstacle that might be enough to outweigh electability in the eyes of a critical mass of Democratic primary voters.\n\nThe Biden lead is built on three elements. One is his near-universal name recognition after eight years as vice president and 36 years in the Senate. The other is his reputation as President Barack Obama's loyal foot soldier, a real asset in a party where the 44th president is still political royalty. Last and perhaps most important is the belief that he is the most electable Democrat running, something members of the anti-Trump \"resistance\" value perhaps even more than ideology.\n\nTo Democrats, including many who count themselves as staunch liberals, beating Trump and making the bad dream of 2016 finally go away is all they care about.\n\nSeen in the light of their desperate desire to oust Trump, nominating a woman, a minority, or a gay man who better represents the beliefs of the party base doesn't seem so important. If Biden can manage to spend the next year campaigning in a manner that will give Democrats the impression that he can stand up to Trump and avoid sounding like the \"crazy old Joe\" stereotype that the president will pound away at (such as his recent statement in which he said \"Margaret Thatcher\" rather than \"Theresa May\" when referring to the current British prime minister), then he might coast to the nomination despite the competition.\n\nMany Democratic voters came of age long after the epic and divisive battles over busing and aren't likely to judge Biden too harshly because of what he said during the Nixon, Ford, or Carter administrations. The same is largely true for the crime bill that was passed a quarter-century ago.\n\nThose issues also have less power because Biden is not running as a moderate Democrat but as one who is very interested in portraying himself as just as much of a supporter of radical causes like the Green New Deal and a vast expansion of federal entitlements. Although it dates back to events that took place nearly 28 years ago, his Anita Hill problem poses a much greater danger to his prospects.\n\nThat is partly due to the enormous importance of the Me Too movement that began to dominate conversations about sexual harassment and assault in late 2017. It was lost on no one that the confirmation hearings of Justice Brett Kavanaugh last fall was something of a rerun of the circus surrounding the Thomas hearings Biden presided over. The treatment of Hill must now be viewed as a contemporary concern rather than one rooted primarily in history, as is the case with Biden's other past stands.\n\nHill also looms as a threat to his candidacy because Biden is too afraid of the left to defend himself. Although the notion of his cruelty to Hill is now part of the liberal catechism, the truth is that Biden doesn't owe her any regrets, let alone an apology.\n\nBiden didn't merely vote against Thomas. The justice and his defenders rightly held Biden responsible for the circus atmosphere in which Democrats brought forward a last-minute accusation to derail his confirmation.\n\nThomas was looking directly at Biden when he famously said that he was being subjected to \"a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks\" in which unsubstantiated \"sleaze\" was being publicly hurled at him. Thomas's impassioned defense of his character and reputation convinced the majority of Americans at the time, and that convinced the Senate to narrowly confirm him.\n\nBut over time, as Thomas maintained a dignified silence about his ordeal, his detractors in popular culture and the media seized control of the narrative. In that retelling, the judge's guilt was assumed. That's how Hill acquired the reputation as a secular saint who had been sacrificed by men like Biden on the altar of male privilege.\n\nAlthough the collective memory of the hearings is now one in which Hill was scorned and disbelieved, the senators did not treat Hill discourteously. They did question her closely about her charges; they asked for details. They probed for inconsistencies and asked reasonable questions about her dealings with Thomas and how and why she had stepped forward to accuse him.\n\nThat was enough to raise doubts about her testimony in the minds of the public as well as the admittedly, all-male committee. Moreover, as the late senator Arlen Specter (who was Hill's most persistent questioner on the committee) noted later in his memoirs, Biden admitted to him that he believed Hill was lying.\n\nThe idea that Biden should have conducted the hearings differently only makes sense if those accused of sexual misconduct must be assumed to be guilty until proven innocent. Biden's committee didn't prevent Hill from making explicit and detailed accusations about what she said Thomas had said and done. And the accusation that he denied her right to bring in corroborating witnesses is another myth that collapses upon closer examination . But in the Me Too era, asking an accuser to substantiate or corroborate her allegations is considered to be a form of unconscionable abuse.\n\nThat's why, when Christine Blasey Ford stepped forward to accuse Kavanaugh of teenage misbehavior that could neither be conclusively proved nor disproved, none of the Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee dared pose a single question to her. Even their designated counsel refrained from doing anything more than gently asking about details with nary a question about any inconsistencies or discrepancies in her story.\n\nThe reckoning for a culture in which sexual harassment and even assault was not treated as serious crimes was long overdue when the Me Too movement emerged. But the idea that those who make such accusations should not be challenged or that the accused has no right to defend themselves against what they allege to be false charges are parodies of American justice.\n\nThe problem for Biden is not just the way the public now views the Thomas hearings, but also the fact that Hill seems to be still burning with resentment at him. Hill is a living, breathing symbol of Me Too who could, if she chooses, act as a personal scourge of Biden that could be greatly destructive of his presidential hopes.\n\nShould Hill be willing to keep speaking out about Biden's alleged offenses, it will be a far more telling blow than any references to the Thomas hearings, either direct or oblique, from the other Democratic challengers. As her New York Times interview indicated, Hill intends to judge Biden's performance in the upcoming campaign. That leaves open the possibility that she may choose to personally intervene to make further demands upon Biden, to claim that his responses are unsatisfactory or to give a boost to one of his competitors that could demolish his lead.\n\nIn a very real sense, Anita Hill holds Biden's presidential future in her hands.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Biden's Performance In Milwaukee County Raises Questions About Wisconsin Votes\n\nHow could Joe Biden outperform Barack Obama in a place like Milwaukee County?\n\nOn election night , Wisconsin was too close to call, but President Trump was ahead by comfortable margins, defying the predictions of corporate media pollsters who prepared America for a Biden blowout in the Badger State. Pollsters' predictions ranged from 17 to five-point margins for Joe Biden. By early Wednesday morning, Biden had been pushed over the edge by a \"ballot dump\" of mail-in votes. While some have alleged that this ballot dump points to fraud, even Republican Party officials say they were prepared for 160,000 mail-in votes to be counted after the polls closed.\n\nOthers have called into question disparities in Wisconsin's high voter turnout when compared to other election cycles. This too can be explained by same-day voter registration in an election that saw record turnout nationwide.\n\nHowever, voter anomalies in Milwaukee County, the largest county in the state, do raise some questions. Specifically, how did Biden outperform former President Barack Obama's 2008 performance in the county, in an election that saw the highest voter turnout in 40 years?\n\nIn 2008, Barack Obama received 316,916 votes in Milwaukee County. In 2016, Hilary Clinton won only 288,822 votes there. But in 2020 Biden outperformed them both, receiving 317,251 votes countywide and besting Obama's share of the vote by nearly two points .\n\nWhat makes this suspicious is that the county is shrinking . The Census Bureau population estimates show that in the last 10 years, thousands of metro Milwaukee residents have left the area for other parts of the state and country. As the Milwaukee Sentinel put it, \"We're lagging in a key metric that often reflects the vitality and desirability of a metro area: population growth.\" The City of Milwaukee, which makes up about 60 percent of the county's population, saw the number of registered voter decline by more than 26,700 from 2008 to 2020 .\n\nWhile it's true that Obama in 2008 won about 18,000 more votes than Biden in the City of Milwaukee itself, one would also expect the countywide vote total for Biden to be less than Obama. Obama was a historic figure that motivated record numbers of blacks to vote in 2008. In addition, he had one of the most robust and successful campaigns in American history. His ground game and get-out-the-vote efforts were unprecedented, utilizing door knocking, canvassing, and phone banking. Not surprisingly, in no small part because of the black vote in Milwaukee County, he won the state of Wisconsin handily by a 6.9-percent margin.\n\nBy contrast, Biden's campaign has never come close to the enthusiasm of Obama's, and he faced an equally obvious enthusiasm gap compared to his 2020 challenger, President Trump, whose devoted supporters swarmed to his events despite a pandemic, and staged numerous non-campaign-directed boat, car, and ATV rallies throughout the state.\n\nWhat makes Biden's vote increase over Obama's in Milwaukee County even more suspicious is that because of Biden's decision to rarely leave his basement for fear of COVID-19, the Biden campaign had no ground game in Wisconsin and other key battleground states. No door-knocking, no volunteer phone-banking, virtually no activity at his anemic campaign offices. Biden staffers were running an almost exclusively digital campaign, sometimes based out of other states. Moreover, the much-anticipated Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee was upended by COVID-19, and Biden came to Wisconsin a total of only two times as the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nWhat's more, Biden has a history of making wildly racist comments. He wrote the 1994 crime bill, which is widely considered to have been discriminatory against black Americans, and during the campaign he made several insensitive and significant blunders, including telling black radio icon, Charlamagne tha God, \"If you don't vote for me, you ain't black.\" Given all of this, it's odd that Biden got more votes in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin's most populous black county, than Obama, the first black major-party presidential candidate in American history.\n\nThe numbers in Milwaukee County suggest something fishy is happening in Wisconsin, and the Trump campaign is right to call for a recount.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Joe Biden underestimates Black voters' ability to think for themselves\n\nWhat Biden said was not only condescending but just as racist as he'd likely claim any random Trump quote on race is.\n\nIn a Friday morning interview on \"The Breakfast Club,\" a popular African-American radio show, Charlemagne tha God interviewed presidential hopeful Joe Biden.\n\nTowards the end of the interview, Charlegmagne told the former Vice President that he needed to come back to the show at a later time because they had more questions for him to which Biden responded , \"You got more questions? Well I'll tell you, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't Black.\"\n\nOf course, this has taken social media by storm and Biden's Senior Advisor took to Twitter to do damage control. Symone Sanders, a Black woman, said that Biden's comet was made \"in jest\" and he was making a distinction between his record with African-Americans and Trump's record with African-Americans.\n\nNice save. Not really.\n\nBiden's comment demonstrates what many African-American GOPers and Millennial and Gen Z African-Americans have been saying for years. The Democratic Party has a tendency to take our support for granted. There has long been an assumption that the African-American voting block will automatically propel Democratic candidates into their target positions.\n\nThe secret, however, is that according to a Pew Research Center poll, 25 percent of African-Americans consider themselves \"conservative\" and 43 percent consider themselves moderate.\n\nHuh?\n\nIt's simple. Many African-American hold conservative values. For example, African-Americans are still very religious and largely Christian. Many can attest to the fact that it's hard to find an African-American who is not pro-life. In other words, while African-Americans may vote for Democrats in large numbers, they aren't necessarily liberal. On the other hand, 55 percent of white Democrats label themselves as liberal.\n\nBasically, Democrats have ridden the social justice wave in order to secure the African-American vote. Call out Trump for being xenophobic, or racist, or sexist and you have the perfect tea to serve Black voters who honestly have no home. If Democrats can keep up the appearance of being a tad less horrid than they believe the other party to be, they can lighten their workload during campaign season because the ask from African-American voters will be much more mundane.\n\nDuring the Democratic primary cycle, Biden regularly expressed his disagreement with many of the initiatives that would not only help all Americans but African-Americans in particular, like student loan forgiveness.\n\nBiden has also been quoted on the record, as early as last year, spouting clearly racist thoughts such as implying that Black parents don't know how to raise their children .\n\nBiden was also one of the writers of the 1994 crime bill that put many African-American and Latino men in jail and bragged about \"60 new death penalties. \" That bill also made the disastrous \"war on drugs\" worse.\n\nWhat Biden said was not only condescending but just as racist as he'd likely claim any random Trump quote on race is. African-Americans are not monoliths. African-Americans are not children who need to be schooled on our political decisions. African-Americans have agency and we can use that agency to turn our backs on the Democratic party at any time.\n\nI'm inclined to agree with the statement made by the Trump campaign (in part):\n\n\"White liberal elitists have continuously dictated which Black Americans are allowed to come to the table and have a voice. It is clear now more than ever, following these racist and dehumanizing remarks, that Joe Biden believes Black men and women are incapable of being independent or free thinking.\"\n\nAs an undecided African-American voter, the Democratic party must do better and they can start by acknowledging their own biases and stop using the injustices that people of color have suffered as their very own trump card-no pun intended.\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

Owens reduced Cardi B to being illiterate, adding that Biden should have had a black intellectual interview him instead of a musician.\n\nCardi B promptly took to Twitter to respond to the video Owens shared of the sit down with Shapiro, tweeting: \"You wanna know why joe gotta talk to me Candice cause I have the #1 song & yet my sister can't go to the beach in the Hampton's wit out trump supporters harassing cause they were by themselves & Santa Claus was harassing my sis GF all because they are a Afro/Hispanic gay couple\"\n\nYou wanna know why joe gotta talk to me Candice cause I have the #1 song & yet my sister can't go to the beach in the Hampton's wit out trump supporters harassing cause they were by themselves & Santa Claus was harassing my sis GF all because they are a Afro/Hispanic gay couple https://t.co/OLQX2mrzbp pic.twitter.com/ISfJStODme\n\nNot only did Cardi B not sufficiently respond to Owens's charges, she went after Trump supporters because her sister apparently could not get any peace and quiet in the Hamptons.\n\nOwens reiterated what Cardi B tweeted, saying: \"To clarify-Joe Biden \"gotta talk\" to you because you have the number 1 song and Santa Claus was harassing your sister? Um. K. Thanks for clearing that one up.\"\n\nTo clarify-Joe Biden \"gotta talk\" to you because you have the number 1 song and Santa Claus was harassing your sister? Um. K. Thanks for clearing that one up. https://t.co/MCaYpPNRXy\n\nCardi B shot back by confirming that she had the \"number 1 song\" and that she didn't want to argue with Candace, adding that \"I honestly just feel sorry for you.\"\n\nYes you are right I have the number 1 song & I have a huge platform and I can make millions go vote to get the MAN THAT USED YOU .I don't want to argue with you Candace I really don't have the time .I honestly just feel sorry for you. https://t.co/haACwKRN13\n\nOwens, unable to let this slide, responded once more, tweeting: \"You are encouraging MILLIONS to go vote for the man that locked up entire generations of black men. Maybe go google: JOE BIDEN AND 1994 CRIME BILL. Joe Biden used you. Bernie Sanders used you. Neither one of them like or know your music. They think you're dumb. #Trump2020 \"\n\nYou are encouraging MILLIONS to go vote for the man that locked up entire generations of black men. Maybe go google: JOE BIDEN AND 1994 CRIME BILL. Joe Biden used you. Bernie Sanders used you. Neither one of them like or know your music. They think you're dumb. #Trump2020 https://t.co/31CHwxnHRo\n\nThe 1994 crime bill Owens referred to is widely considered to be the engine that contributed to the mass incarceration of black people as crime sky-rocketed through the 80's.\n\nCardi B charged Owens with advocating for a presidential candidate who \"laugh Everytime a black men gets killed by a cop and tell millions of Americans to drink bleach.\"\n\nYou are representing everything that is wrong, sick and soulless. You should stop and think. pic.twitter.com/vsT2Whqlsy\n\nThe online bickering only continued as Owens backed out of the tweet thread to say: \"I'm almost 6 months pregnant and had to rip @iamcardib a new WAP. Watch here: https://instagram.com/tv/CE0Rtn4FqE7/?igshid=qa3f1mrr4a9h... Goodnight fam. #TRUMP2020 all day, every day.\"\n\nI'm almost 6 months pregnant and had to rip @iamcardib a new WAP. Watch here: https://t.co/mLbMeDgm9s Goodnight fam. #TRUMP2020 all day, every day.\n\nCardi B showed first-class attitude by responding to Owens, saying that \"your baby singing wap wap wap this some dry a** pu**yyy.\"\n\nYour baby singing wap wap wap this some dry ass pussyyyy ????????????? https://t.co/ooJccpsXXn\n\nOwens finished Cardi B off by accusing the musician of attacking an unborn child, adding \"how very DEMOCRAT of you.\" Owens went on to say that over 18 million black babies have been sent to the \"slaughter\" since 1973, noting that Cardi B's political party makes it unsafe for black babies from the time they are in their mother's womb.\n\nAttacking an unborn child. How very DEMOCRAT of you. While I have you-did you know your party has supported the slaughter of over 18 million black babies since 1973? Did you know the most unsafe place for a black child is in its mother's womb because of YOUR party? https://t.co/hEJ8HR0ZRg\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.
