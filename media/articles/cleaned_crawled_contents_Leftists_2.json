      "text": "Facebook allowed pro-Trump group to pose as leftists in attempt to split Democratic vote\n\nReporting on Friday revealed that Facebook knowingly allowed a digital marketing firm tied to a pro-Trump group to release a series of ads purporting to be from a fake left-wing organization ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, while election officials failed to investigate the group at the time.\n\nAs The Guardian reported , a right-wing marketing firm called Rally Forge ran a $5,000 ad campaign beginning just days before the 2018 election, showing ads promoting Green Party candidates in an effort to split the Democratic vote and help Republicans in several close races. The ads were purported to be placed by a group called America Progress Now and expressed support for democratic socialism.\n\nFacebook launched an investigation into the ads just after the election and quickly determined that America Progress Now's official page on the platform was run by the same three men-Jake Hoffman, Connor Clegg, and Colton Duncan-who were administrators for Turning Point USA, the pro-Trump college organization.\n\nTo the alarm of a number of Facebook employees, The Guardian reported, the company did not find Rally Forge or Turning Point USA to be in violation of any of its policies.\n\nOne product manager at the time said a case could be made for Rally Forge and Turning Point USA having engaged in voter suppression through the ads, and asked, \"Can we strengthen our ads transparency policies so that political ads are indeed transparent to the user?\"\n\nAfter the election, Facebook deactivated several other right-wing accounts run by the administrators, but the move did not stop Rally Forge from establishing a \"troll farm\" out of Phoenix, Arizona in 2020. Working for Turning Point Action, a group linked to Turning Point USA, the firm hired teenagers to post pro-Trump messages on social media, some of which cast doubt on the integrity of the election system.\n\nSophie Zhang, a former Facebook employee who participated in the investigation of the fake Green Party ads, wrote on Twitter Friday, \"One wonders if [Rally Forge] would have escalated to troll farms, had FB deterred them in 2018.\"\n\n\"This is egregious,\" tweeted the women's rights group UltraViolet on Friday.\n\nBeyond Facebook's decision to allow the firm to remain on Facebook after determining the ads were fraudulent, the ads \"appeared to violate federal laws that require independent expenditures to be filed with the [Federal Election Commission] and include proper disclosures on advertisements,\" The Guardian reported.\n\n\"This is an example of why disclosure is so important in elections: swing state voters who saw 'America Progress Now' ads promoting Green party candidates would've had no idea that they were the handiwork of Republican political operatives,\" Brendan Fischer, director of federal reform at CLC, told The Guardian.\n\nThe Campaign Legal Center (CLC) filed a complaint with the FEC in 2019 over America Progress Now and the administrators' failure to disclose the true source of the Facebook ads, only to have the case dismissed before the FEC could conduct an investigation.\n\nThe election commissioners declined to look further into the complaint after a man named Evan Muhlstein contacted them to take full responsibility to the ads, claiming he alone had failed to file the ad expenditures with the FEC and saying his \"inexperience\" was to blame.\n\n\"The FEC's job is to enforce the transparency laws and protect voters' right to know who is trying to influence them, but the agency here failed to conduct even a minimal investigation,\" Fischer said.\n\nAccording to former FEC Commissioner Ann Ravel, who served on the commission from 2013 to 2017, Muhlstein's admission to the FEC appeared to amount to \"clear fraud,\" as he never disclosed to the officials that the ads had been the work of Rally Forge.\n\nAt the time, though, Muhlstein's claim was enough to convince at least one FEC commissioner, James \"Trey\" Trainor, that the CLC had engaged in \"wild speculation\" by filing a complaint.\n\n\"This case wasn't about a 'fake political group ... exploit[ing] Facebook rules ... and hid[ing] spending from the FEC,'\" Trainor wrote. \"In fact, APN was established by an unsophisticated individual trying to show his support for several third-party candidates, but he got tripped by the myriad regulations governing online political speech.\"\n\nZhang denounced the FEC for failing to contact Facebook regarding Muhlstein's claim to verify that he'd administered the America Progress Now page-a cursory investigation which would have immediately revealed the true owners of the page.\n\n\"It's quite possible that FB would have blown the FEC off,\" Zhang said. \"But many employees were upset over this case, and may have come forward if asked. I would likely have if I'd known.\""

      "text": "Right-wing pro-Trump group deletes tweet mocking 'leftists' for wearing protective masks after co-founder dies from COVID-19\n\nOn Tuesday, July 28, Charlie Kirk - co-founder of the right-wing student group Turning Point USA and a supporter of President Donald Trump - announced on Twitter that the organization's other co-founder, 80-year-old Republican activist Bill Montgomery, had died of complications from COVID-19 . Earlier that day, TPUSA had posted a tweet mocking \"leftists\" for wearing face masks - and that tweet, according to Business Insider's Tom Porter, was deleted following Montgomery's death .\n\nTPUSA, sadly, has a history of downplaying the importance of social distancing measures and ridiculing the use of face masks. In a tweet posted on July 22 - less than a week before Montgomery's death - TPUSA tweeted a sign that read, \"Imagine if everyone wearing a mask was carrying a copy of the Constitution instead\" (as if trying to avoid getting sick with COVID-19 and possibly dying from it somehow limits one's ability to defend the Constitution).\n\nIn a March 22 op-ed for Fox News' website, Kirk acknowledged how dangerous COVID-19 is and encouraged young adults to be careful. However, Kirk has been critical of local governments that have mandated face masks in public places; on his podcast , Kirk recently declared, \"Do not force me to wear a mask - it's that simple. I'm not gonna do it, I'm not.\""

      "text": "Democrats, liberals and leftists are being way too cynical about Trump's conviction\n\nEditor's note: The following first appeared in Everything Is Horrible, Noah's newsletter. -JS\n\nFriday was a very bad day for Donald Trump. Bill Pruitt, a producer on Donald Trump's reality TV show The Apprentice , published a piece accusing Trump of using the n-word to denigrate a finalist on the show -- and to justify not letting them win.\n\nThat was in the morning. By the afternoon, Trump was convicted by a jury of his peers on all 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments. Trump was covering up a sexual encounter with adult film star Stormy Daniels. He was worried that if the story came out it would cost him the 2016 election.\n\nBoth of these are huge, negative stories about Trump. Yet many Democrats, liberals and leftists on social media responded with cynicism. We already knew Trump was racist, many said. His hardcore supporters won't care that he's a convicted felon. Nothing matters. Nothing changes.\n\nI think there are various incentives here. Cynicism plays well on social media; it makes you look wise and jaded, allows you to dunk on the more hopeful, and generally is designed to boost social media engagement and brand building.\n\nMore charitably, I think people are often afraid to feel hope because they are afraid to have those hopes dashed. Insisting that nothing matters is a way to lower one's own expectations, to keep oneself from feeling too optimistic. You don't want to feel happy, because you can't stand to feel the disappointment as America fails again, and as fascism continues to close in.\n\nI understand that for sure. I am also frightened and despairing and miserable. I get the impulse to curl into a ball of cynicism, lest hope make you intolerably vulnerable.\n\nI think, though, that that impulse can be self-defeating - and morally wrong. And the reason it's morally wrong is that, in cases like this, the bad news about Trump doesn't come from nowhere. It comes from particular people standing up to him and insisting that he face at least some minimal consequences for his wrongdoing.\n\nBill Pruitt knows that coming forward is going to mean he gets death threats, and possibly worse than death threats, from Trump's neo-Nazi fanbase. The jurors who delivered their unanimous guilty verdict have to know that Trump's fans, and possibly Trump himself, will try to find their names and addresses. All of them have to know that if Trump is elected president, he may well try to prosecute them - or just have them shot. Fascists do that. And Trump is a fan of Putin's.\n\nIt's quite possible that neither of these setbacks for Trump will affect the election. Most of Trump's supporters know pretty well who he is, and either tolerate it for partisanship's sake or are enthusiastic about his thuggery and criminality. A tape (if it comes out) of racial slurs might swing some votes; a felony conviction might swing some votes. Or they might not.\n\nBut defending democracy and fighting fascism isn't just about the election. It's about the erosion of institutions, the erosion of individual courage, the erosion of a sense of right and wrong. In that context, the constant drumbeat of cynicism, the constant assertion that nothing matters, even defensively, can actually contribute to fascism's victory. If we assume that there is no collective virtue, that resistance is useless, then what else is there for Trump to do? He's already won.\n\nSo in these cases, and in general, when people take a stand, and insist that, yes, some things are right, and fascism is wrong - don't leap to the keyboard to insist that their sacrifice (and it is always a sacrifice) doesn't matter. Instead, take a moment to appreciate, to stand in solidarity with, and yes, even to be inspired by those people who come forward at considerable risk to themselves to oppose Trump today, in whatever way they can.\n\nBill Pruitt and those jurors put a target on their own heads, because they felt that holding Trump accountable - even in a limited way, even for a day - was important. That's not foolish or naïve. It's admirable. And anyone who thinks democracy is worth fighting for, and fascism is worth fighting against, should say as much."

      "text": "'Sick joke': Progressives roundly reject idea of Rahm Emanuel as DNC chair\n\nProgressives were left fuming and flummoxed over reporting Friday that Rahm Emanuel is considering running for chair of the Democratic National Committee, with many leftists wondering whether the party has learned anything from its loss of the White House, Senate, and, arguably, the country's working-class voters.\n\nAxios first reported that Emanuel-President Joe Biden's ambassador to Japan and a former congressman, Chicago mayor, and chief of staff to former President Barack Obama-is mulling whether to seek the top DNC post. Current DNC chair Jamie Harrison, who was elected to the post in 2021, is unlikely to seek a new term, which would begin in March.\n\nEmanuel has some powerful backers among the war-and-Wall Street wing that has dominated the Democratic party for decades.\n\n\"If they said, 'Well, what should we do? Who should lead the party?' I would take Ambassador Rahm Emanuel, and I would bring him back from Japan, and I would appoint him chairman of the Democratic National Committee,\" prominent political consultant David Axelrod, who ran both of Obama's successful presidential campaigns, said Wednesday on his podcast.\n\nAxelrod followed up the next day with a post on X, the social platform formerly known as Twitter, in which he wrote of Emanuel, \"Dude knows how to fight and win.\"\n\nReaction came fast and furious, with Jonathan Cohn, policy director at the group Progressive Massachusetts, asking on the social network Bluesky, \"How is this not a sick joke?\"\n\nCenter for International Policy executive vice president Matt Duss, a former foreign policy adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) writing on X that \"if you assembled a team of top scientists and told them to come up with a plan to ensure that the Democratic Party continues to lose working-class voters, I doubt they could do better than 'Make Rahm Emanuel head of the DNC.'\"\n\nComedian, author, and podcaster Kate Willett said on X: \"If I had to pick one individual who set the stage for what seems like it may be decades of Trumpism, it's Rahm Emanuel. Imagine if Obama had saved peoples' homes in 2008 and put the bankers in jail? Truly fixed healthcare? Rahm worked diligently to make sure that didn't happen.\"\n\nMiles Kampf-Lassin, the senior editor at the progressive website In These Times , wrote , \"I've said it before and can't believe I have to say it again: No amount of rebranding can change the fact that Rahm Emanuel's political career has been an abject failure-neoliberal centrism is exactly the wrong direction for the Democratic Party.\"\n\nHafiz Rashid argued Friday in a New Republic article that, if he wins the post, Emanuel could be \"the worst possible DNC chair.\"\n\n\"The fact that Emanuel has been disconnected from local and state politics for years... seems unlikely to help,\" Rashid asserted. \"Democrats are currently expected to tap someone with expertise at the grassroots level and an understanding of how Democrats are winning elections now-two things Emanuel sorely lacks.\"\n\nApparently questioning the strategic wisdom of Vice President Kamala Harris ' failed Democratic presidential run, Warren Gunnels, a staff director for Sanders, said on X, \"Ruling Elite: Let's get Dick Cheney's endorsement and anoint Rahm Emanuel as DNC Chair.\""

      "text": "The importance of Merrick Garland stating the obvious\n\nOne of the eternal questions among liberals and leftists is whether Donald Trump and the Republicans believe what they are saying.\n\nThese days, they're saying Joe Biden manufactured the former president's felony conviction in an effort to interfere with the 2024 election. They're saying the president's \"weaponization of the legal system\" is the reason for their own weaponization of it in the future.\n\n\"You have to wonder if the magas believe their own outlandish rhetoric,\" Lindsay Beyerstein said in her latest for the Editorial Board .\n\nSome do, she said , but most don't.\n\n\"This embrace of frothing conspiracism is an excuse to justify the authoritarian measures they've long wanted to implement.\"\n\nI agree, but I want to add a layer.\n\nSome don't know.\n\nThe great depth of ignorance in America\n\nI don't mean the Republicans. As Lindsay said , they are not ignorant. They know they are peddling a conspiracy theory. They know the facts, too. They know the criminal trial of Donald Trump is led by a state law enforcement official who sought justice according to state law in a case presided over by a state judge in New York state's judicial system.\n\nThey know the president - this one, or any other, at any time - has nothing to do with state and local law enforcement. The president is the executive of the federal government, not state government. He's the leader of America, but he's not the leader of Manhattan or Albany.\n\nNo, I'm talking about normal people, including some GOP voters.\n\nSome don't know.\n\nWe can ask if Trump and the Republicans believe what they're saying, but let's not forget the impact of their saying it on those who are, for reasons good and bad, too ignorant to even ask whether they mean it.\n\nThey just believe the Republicans do.\n\nThey don't know enough about how government in America works. They don't know enough about the US Constitution, the sovereignty of the states, the separation of powers. They don't even know that Biden doesn't control, you know, everything . (Indeed, lots of people, even quite famous people, believe presidents are very nearly omnipotent.)\n\nThis is important to point out, because liberals and leftists typically do not place value on the important role played by the ignorant. (We tend to go straight to whether the Republicans believe what they say.) The Republicans, however, do place value on ignorance. They depend on it . There are only so many people around as cynical and craven as they are. A vast majority of people don't agree with them or don't know enough about anything to know whether they agree with them.\n\nWhich brings me to Merrick Garland.\n\nFor the Republicans, conspiracy theories work\n\nThe US attorney general gets a lot of grief from liberals and leftists, because he's an institutionalist who believes in maintaining norms. But what he said during yesterday's testimony on Capitol Hill wasn't just more of the same, not when you consider the great depth of ignorance in this country, which is usually working in the Republicans' favor.\n\nIn front of the House Judiciary, he said what many needed to hear. \"We do not control the Manhattan district attorney, the Manhattan district attorney does not report to us,\" he said . Later, he added : \"That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself.\"\n\nThat might have sounded obvious, and it might have come off as rather feeble on account of sounding obvious, but remember - lots of people just don't know enough about how government works to know it was obvious. They might have been surprised to learn the president has no control over state criminal proceedings. (Perhaps they might have felt lied to!) And remember, the Republican response partly depends on ignorance. People who are knowledgeable about civic structures are unlikely to be duped into believing their conspiracy theories.\n\nThese days, conspiracy theories are the Republican party line, not because the Republicans are crazy, but because they are practical . Conspiracy theories work. \"Joe Biden rigged the trial\" attacks their chief adversary while softening the blow to Trump's campaign.\n\nBut they only work on two groups. One is the cynics, that is, people who may know they are being lied to, but go along with it, because going along is useful. Two is the ignorant, that is, people who don't know enough about anything to know they're being lied to. Conspiracy theories rally the GOP's cynics while bullying the ignorant (who are sometimes politely called \"low-propensity voters\") into falling in line.\n\nTogether, these two groups may constitute a majority of American voters, but things like Garland's remarks can wedge them apart. He can't do that alone, of course. Fortunately, the Republicans themselves often provide the wedge by way of saying the quiet part out loud.\n\nWedge apart the GOP and the ignorant\n\nAccording to Axios , on Tuesday, the Republicans in the House want to move on legislation that would \"allow current or former presidents to move any state case brought against them - such as the one in New York that resulted in Trump's conviction - to federal court.\"\n\nWith this bill, these Republicans are admitting they don't believe Joe Biden rigged Trump's trial. If they believed it, they wouldn't be talking about moving things from the state to the federal level. They wouldn't be talking about levels of government at all given that levels of government are entirely missing from their lies. According to the conspiracy theory, there are no levels. Biden controls everything.\n\n\"Current or former presidents\" refers to Trump, presumably. Why move state criminal cases to the federal level? Because presidents administrate the federal government, not state governments. Trump can't stop state trials, but he could (in theory) stop federal trials.\n\nMoreover, if more people were aware of the fact that there are indeed levels of governments - by which one does not usually involve the other - the impact of their conspiracy theory on people who don't know much about government would be blunted, perhaps neutralized.\n\nMerrick Garland is trying to make them aware. So are the Republicans - indirectly. Liberals and leftists can talk about whether they mean what they say or we can talk about the meaning of what they say for the benefit of those who don't know enough to know what it means."

      "text": "Trump's ambassador of paranoia\n\nVice presidential hopeful JD Vance recently took the stage at an event organized by the most influential far-right pastor you've never heard of. His name is Lance Wallnau and he popularized a doctrine that calls for Christians to conquer every sphere of society from the government to professional sports.\n\nWallnau is a self-proclaimed Christian Nationalist who preaches that leftists aren't even people , just vessels for demons. He accused Vice President Kamala Harris of witchcraft . He prayed for God to kill Trump's enemies . Wallnau's message is a mishmash of Bible memes and conspiracy theories. He preaches the Big Lie as gospel truth, fusing Christian nationalism and election denialism.\n\nIn 2020, Wallnau gathered the faithful for the insurrection of January 6th. Today, he's responsible for a good chunk of the Trump campaign's Get Out the Vote effort. He rails against George Soros, the globalists, the World Economic Forum and vaccines. He hypes quack stem-cell therapies and Donald Trump figurines as fervently as he hypes Jesus.\n\nMost importantly, Wallnau preaches that Donald Trump is a modern-day King Cyrus, a heathen anointed by God. The upshot is that no matter how immoral, blasphemous or criminal Trump is, it doesn't matter because he's God's instrument to impose Christian dominion. If you've ever wondered why evangelicals don't care that Trump is a philandering felon, Wallnau's King Cyrus meme explains a lot.\n\nJD Vance is not an evangelical, but he seemed at home at the Courage Campaign. At least, he seemed as comfortable as he gets in the presence of actual voters. And why not? Vance is the interface between the C-suites and the fever swamps of Magaland. It's why he spends so much time on weird podcasts . As a Yale-educated US senator, he legitimates the fringe. As a rightwing podcast bro, he shores up the Trump ticket's bona fides with the supplement-slurping conspiracist base.\n\nOne of Vance's key functions is to validate all the factions of the maga conspiracist coalition.\n\nConspiracism is the overarching ideology of the maga movement. The three pillars of the maga platform are the Deep State , the Big Lie and the Great Replacement , and Vance eagerly expounds on all three.\n\nMoreover, Vance moves effortlessly among integralist Catholics, protestant New Apostolic Reformation types, and the more secular Silicon Valley contingent exemplified by Elon Musk.\n\nVance's other role is to reassure the more staid elements of the conservative coalition that unchecked conspiracism is politically useful. In 2021, Vance exhorted the future leaders of the conservative movement to make common cause with Alex Jones, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and other raving conspiracy theorists. According to Vance, the conservative movement is doomed unless it makes common cause with lunatics.\n\n\"Believing crazy things is not the mark of whether somebody should be rejected. Believing important truths should be the mark of whether we accept somebody, and if they believe some crazy things on the side, that's fine,\" Vance said. \"Doesn't mean you have to defend their craziest views. But by all means, if this movement is going to survive, we need to speak for truth.\"\n\nThe truth, according to Vance, is that an international cabal of financier sex perverts is ruining our society. This is the closest thing Vance has to an ideology. Like Wallnau, Vance is willing to use flawed instruments. As long as someone's willing to affirm the core conspiracy premise, Vance is flexible about whether it's dressed up in religious lingo, or whether his brother- or sister-in-paranoia also believes in Jewish space lasers or a federal plot to turn the frogs gay."

      "text": "How the Left Can Become a True Political Force to Be Reckoned With\n\nThe 2012 elections may prove to have been a watershed in several different respects.  Despite the efforts by the political Right to suppress the Democratic electorate, something very strange happened:  voters, angered by the attacks on their rights, turned out in even greater force in favor of Democratic candidates.  The deeper phenomenon is that the changing demographics of the USA also became more evident-45% of Obama voters were people of color, and young voters turned out in large numbers in key counties.\n\nUnfortunately for the political Left, these events unfolded with the Left having limited visibility and a limited impact-except indirectly through certain mass organizations-on the outcome.\n\nThe setting\n\nOn one level it is easy to understand why many Republicans found it difficult to believe that Mitt Romney did not win the election.  First, the US remains in the grip of an economic crisis with an official unemployment rate of 7.9%.  In some communities, the unemployment is closer to 20%.  While the Obama administration had taken certain steps to address the economic crisis, the steps have been insufficient in light of the global nature of the crisis.  The steps were also limited by the political orientation of the Obama administration, i.e., corporate liberal, and the general support by many in the administration for neo-liberal economics.\n\nThe second factor that made the election a 'nail biter' was the amount of money poured into this contest.  Approximately $6 billion was spent in the entire election.  In the Presidential race it was more than $2 billion raised and spent, but this does not include independent expenditures.  In either case, this was the first post- Citizen United Presidential campaign, meaning that money was flowing into this election like a flood after a dam bursts.  Republican so-called Super Political Action Committees (Super PACs) went all out to defeat President Obama.\n\nThird, the Republicans engaged in a process of what came to be known as \"voter suppression\" activity.  Particularly in the aftermath of the 2010 midterm elections, the Republicans created a false crisis of alleged voter fraud as a justification for various draconian steps aimed at allegedly cleansing the election process of illegitimate voters.  Despite the fact that the Republicans could not substantiate their claims that voter fraud was a problem on any scale, let alone a significant problem, they were able to build up a clamor for restrictive changes in the process, thereby permitting the introduction of various laws to make it more difficult for voters to cast their ballots.  This included photographic voter identification, more difficult processes for voter registration, and the shortening of early voting.  Though many of these steps were overturned through the intervention of courts, they were aimed at causing a chilling impact on the voters, specifically, the Democratic electorate. [1]\n\nSo, what happened?\n\nPrior to the election, we argued that what was at stake in the 2012 elections was actually the changing demographics of the USA (along with a referendum on the role of government in the economy).  What transpired in the elections was very much about demographics.\n\nThe percentage of white voters dropped from 74% to 72% between 2008 and 2012.  Romney received 59% of the white vote.\n\nYet something else happened and it took many people by surprise.  Despite the intimidation caused by the voter suppression statutes-and the threatened actions by right-wing groups-African Americans, Latinos and Asians turned out in significant numbers, voting overwhelmingly for the Democrats. [2] 93% of African Americans went with Obama, as did 71% of Latinos (which represented an increase over 2008) and, despite the fact that Asians are only 2-3% of the electorate, they went 73% in favor of Obama (which was a jump from 62% in 2008).  The youth vote, by the way, increased to 19% of the electorate, over 18% in 2008, and went overwhelmingly for Obama.  Labor union members went for Obama at a rate of 65%, and unions themselves played a major role in many key states in terms of voter mobilization.  By the strategic mobilization of these voters in a well-organized 'ground game,' Obama won 332 Electoral College votes compared with Romney's 206.  Obama's popular vote total was also 2.6% head of Romney.\n\nThe Romney/Ryan camp was entirely unprepared for this.  While it is the case that the popular vote total was not overwhelming for Obama, there was nothing particularly unusual in US history for such a result.  The bottom line is that Obama clearly won both the Electoral College vote and the popular vote and, as such, can claim a mandate for his next steps.\n\nIt is important that one understands that the African American/Latino/Asian turnout, along with the long-lines waiting to vote (including in the days of early voting) represented an audacious defiance of the forces that sought to suppress the vote.  This audaciousness also represented a response to the increasingly racist attacks on Obama, attacks that were taken very personally by people of color generally and African Americans in particular. [3]\n\nWhat was equally interesting about the November 6 th elections were those in the House of Representatives and the Senate.  Contrary to many expectations, the Democrats not only held onto the Senate, but slightly increased their margin of control.  Within that expansion was the election of Elizabeth Warren from Massachusetts to the seat once occupied by the late Teddy Kennedy.  Warren, who gained a strong reputation in the fight to control Wall Street, promised actions on behalf of working people.  Independent Senator Bernie Sanders, a socialist in Vermont, also decisively won reelection.\n\nIn the House of Representatives, Democrats increased their totals, but Republicans still dominate.  This is mainly the result of the gerrymandering carried out by Republican state legislators during redistricting.  The legacy of this gerrymandering may last at least a decade, part of the fallout which resulted from lower voter turnout combined with the Republican mobilization in the 2010 midterm elections.\n\nOf particular note in the elections was the increased presence of women, especially progressive women, being elected to office, including the first openly gay Senator (from Wisconsin, Tammy Baldwin).  The state of New Hampshire now has women in all of the top governing positions.\n\nAdditionally several progressive ballot initiatives passed in various states, including on same-sex marriage and the decriminalization of marijuana.  An interesting initiative in the state of Michigan to alter the state constitution in order to protect the right of workers to collective bargaining was defeated after a major and concerted attack by pro-employer groups.\n\nWhat to make of the elections?\n\nWe return to our earlier conclusion, i.e., that what was at stake in 2012 was not Obama's record but instead 2012 was a referendum over demographics and the role of government with the far right.  Some on the Left found this assertion worthy of ridicule rather than introspection, and dismissed it, claiming that of course Obama's record was central to the debate.\n\nThe results of the election conform much more to our conclusions.  The vote for Obama, particularly by people of color, could not possibly have been the result of the conclusion that Obama's record made him the great leader.  Certainly his record was better than the interpretation projected by Romney/Ryan, but it was also the case that Obama's record was complicated if not problematic.  After all, we had witnessed an economic stimulus that, while significant by historical standards, was insufficient to the task; a healthcare reform package that, while bringing healthcare to millions, was based on a corporate model first elaborated by Mitt Romney when he was Governor of Massachusetts; a failure to close Guantanamo; the continuation and escalation of the Afghanistan/Pakistan war, including the usage of drone strikes; and the failure to adopt a clear policy to address systemic racial injustice in the USA.  While there were a number of reforms that were introduced that were of significance, this was all far less than most of Obama's supporters had hoped would be introduced.\n\nSo, what then could one say motivated the vote?  We return to demographics and the role of government.  Obama's very existence represents the problematic future for the political Right; it's not that he's an individual whose birthplace is alleged by them to not be in the USA.   This insane propaganda from the Birther movement is designed to distort the point entirely.  The Birthers [4] and their off-spring hate Obama not because of where he was born but because he was born here.  His very existence illustrates the changing demographics of the USA and its move away from being a 'white republic' governed by a broad 'white' front. Instead, we are moving more towards something else, toward a more openly multi-ethnic/multi-racial society, if not politically then at least numerically.\n\nThe election thus represented a repudiation of the right-wing irrationalists seeking to turn the clock back, and not just on race, but gender and class as well.  In this sense it was not so much about what Obama had accomplished as it was about what sort of society 61 million people did not want.  That retrograde society, which was rejected, was a neo-apartheid order of domination that condemned at least 47% of the population (according to Romney's calculations) to marginalization, and condemned at least 90% of society to continued economic distress and submission.\n\nRomney was proposing to reduce the role of government even further, at least when it came to supporting something approaching a social safety net.  61 million people recognized the barbarism contained in his message and program, and responded accordingly.\n\nIn sum, the November 6 th elections were not a referendum challenging Obama's course from the Left, but rather rejecting a challenge from the Right, since there was no viable Left alternative.  At the same time there was an additional interesting feature of the elections as identified in various opinion polls:  Democratic voters, while not as starry-eyed as many were in 2008, are looking for Obama to fight for them, or at least fight on their behalf.  Frustration with Obama's premature compromising in the name of so-called bi-partisanship wins the President few accolades within his base.  The electorate is looking for something very different.\n\nThe Left in the elections:  Building mass organizations vs. the mouths that screeched\n\nContrary to those who suggest that no Left exists in the USA, it is better to understand that there are two and a half Lefts in the USA.  There is the organized Left, which takes the forms of very small political organizations, some of them calling themselves political parties, which are anti-capitalist and generally for some sort of socialism.  There is also what Chilean Marxist Marta Harnecker would describe as the \"social movement Left,\" which are forces involved in left-leaning mass organizations and non-profits, more often than not single-issue or based within a specific sector.  There is finally what we could term the 'half' Left, that is, the 'Lone Rangers,' the  rather large number of independent individuals who self-identify as leftists but are unaffiliated with any left-wing project, with the possible exception a job with social impact, such as writers or teachers or health care workers.  In each case these individuals and formations are anti-capitalist and seek a social transformation of the USA, but with varying degrees of organization, insurgency and effectiveness.\n\nThe US Left has historically had a difficult time addressing electoral politics.  There are several reasons--the complications that arise from the undemocratic nature of the US electoral system; the size of the USA; the lack of attention to strategy; and most important, ambivalence when it comes to race.  As a result the Left frequently sways back and forth between what could, perhaps, be described as apocalyptism on the one hand (i.e., waving the red flag so that the masses see us before the whole system collapses and, therefore, they know where to go), to reformist/incrementalism, on the other (i.e., believing that the best that can be done is to submerge into the Democratic Party and help move change until the system reaches a point where quantitative change morphs into qualitative change).\n\nThere is currently no significant and unified effort within the Left(s) toward building a self-conscious, broad radical Left project that has the objective of winning power.  The bulk of the US Left does not think politically.  Rather it engages in ideological or moral struggle and often thinks that ideology or morality is identical to politics.  Rather than conceptualizing a protracted struggle for power based on the need to build a majoritarian bloc, too many individuals and organizations on the Left remain trapped in a self-satisfying world of small sects and Facebook tirades rather than the hard work of building the alliances of grassroots groups necessary to win.\n\nThe limitations of the Left's approach to the fight for power can be illustrated in any number of places, but, for the moment, let's reflect upon the electoral realm.  Consider the following.  In 1920 Eugene V. Debs ran, for the fifth time, for the Presidency.  Though in jail at the time (as a result of political repression), he received nearly one million votes.  In the famous 1948 campaign of Progressive Party candidate Henry Wallace, the candidate received 1,157,328 votes and no Electoral College votes.  In the same election, Dixiecrat candidate Strom Thurmond received more popular votes and 39 electoral votes.\n\nNow, in 2012, Green Party candidate Jill Stein received 402,125 votes.  This is going the wrong way.  But it reflects, more than anything, not the character of Stein or her supporters but the approach toward electoral politics taken by the Green Party and many of their followers.\n\nIndependent presidential candidacies in the modern era reflect what can be described as a flag-waving/protest mode rather than a struggle for power/bloc-building mode.  In other words, they aim to express both outrage and reasoned critique at the system and frustration with the toxicity of democratic capitalism.  They have no hope of gaining power either because they do not believe in struggling to gain power or because they believe that power is gained when the ship sinks and we, on the Left, are positioned in the proper lifeboats prepared to save the mass of distressed passengers.\n\nThis is only on the electoral side.  The various small organizations of the organized Left which do not engage in electoral politics in their own names seem relatively content being small and of little consequence.  In the absence of an effort at building a majoritarian bloc they can remain comfortable in their particular niche(s) and not feel the cold winds that often accompany entering into unexplored demographic or geographic territories. They remind us of the old Clifford Odet's play, 'Waiting for Lefty.'\n\nAt the same time, over the last 5-10 years there has developed a new interest in electoral engagement in the social movement Left.  Sprouting up in different parts of the USA have been progressive-rather than explicitly Left-political formations that have either engaged in what has come to be known as \"civic engagement\" work, i.e., voter registration, education, voting rights, electoral law reform, and/or actual electoral engagement.  The strength of this work is that its orientation can be described as left/progressive in that these are mass-based projects attempting to reach out to a broad array within our natural base.  Organizations ranging from Progressive Democrats of America to the Virginia New Majority and Florida New Majority fall into this camp, though the list is quite a bit longer than just these organizations.\n\nIn the lead up to the 2012 elections the Left was badly divided over how to respond.  One segment, which we will describe as the \"mouths that screeched\" were adamant that Obama had betrayed progressives; that he was not progressive; that he represented the empire; and therefore not only should not be supported but that it was ideological treason to suggest any level of support or even just to give him a vote without any implied support.\n\nThe vitriolic attacks coming from this sector masked the fact that this segment of the Left is actually becoming irrelevant.  They had no visible impact on the elections and their protests were largely ignored.  Unfortunately, one of the key things that this segment missed was the racial element of the 2012 elections and the need for voters of color, along with a good number of white allies, to push back at the 'demographic' attacks that were underway from the political Right.  By focusing on all that Obama did incorrectly, this segment of the Left ignored, as well, that the Left and progressives are on the strategic defensive in the USA and that they need alliances that will provide some level of space within which we can operate.\n\nThe segment of the Left that actually made a difference was those within the organized Left and the social movement Left who engaged their mass organizations and non-profits in electoral activity. [5] Whether it was voter registration; voter education efforts; electoral infrastructure work; or Get Out The Vote efforts, many of these organizations proved themselves to be very effective campaign organizations.  They appear to be in the process of laying the groundwork for the sorts of progressive alliance building that will be necessary to respond to the next electoral realignment that hits the USA.\n\nWhat is missing entirely, however, is a coherent, self-identified Left, taking either the form of a united front, alliance, or political organization that can serve as a pole for independent, radical yet grounded Left politics.  The mass base for such an effort exists.  The opinion polls that demonstrate that roughly one third of the population are open to directions other than capitalism means that approximately 90 million people are seeking alternatives.  Consider that 90 million figure when you review the stats for the Green Party's votes in 2012.  The Occupy Movement also evidenced a political fissure that is certain to widen as the class struggle intensifies, though admittedly Occupy did not result in the formation of one or several credible Left organizations (no criticism implied).\n\nMoving forward\n\nThe challenge for the Left then becomes two fold.  One, there must be a self-identified, self-aware, mass radical Left formation that openly and unapologetically advocates against capitalism and for environmentally friendly socialism.  Whether such an organization is called a political party, alliance or some other name is secondary to what it must do and what it must avoid.       What it must avoid is the idea that it can or should compete in the electoral realm on the presidential lev e l at this time. That is a no-win scenario.  What it can do, however, is to unite and train the existing leaders in mass movements and develop an anti-capitalist program and ultimately an anti-capitalist project.  We term this notion of a new, self-conscious and organized Left-inspired by the approach taken by and expression used by Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci-to be the \"Modern Tecumseh.\" [6] Second, the Left can also help to build a progressive front-perhaps a popular front against finance capital that unites disparate forces-that gains electoral expression in the form of an organization (rather than a third party) that runs candidates within the Democratic Party or, runs them independently if conditions exist (such as in Vermont where the candidacy and leadership of Senator Sanders needs to be supported).\n\nAs long as the progressive forces in the USA are on the defensive there will be tactical alliances that take place that are not satisfying but are nevertheless necessary.  These should not be treated as matters of principle but rather as expressions of necessity of the moment.  Further, we on the Left must pay much greater attention to what is transpiring among the people themselves.  The fact that so many on the Left would have focused on Obama's record and virtually ignored the intense racist offensive against Obama (and its broader implications) demonstrated that many of our friends are out of touch with reality.\n\nReality, however, is a good and necessary starting point if one ever wishes to build a majoritarian bloc and win power. We fully expect to see an intensification of class struggle in the near term. We need to assert a new culture of organizing capable of meeting the demands it will place on us, and now is the time to begin.\n\n[1] The issue of voting rights remains critical since there are cases before the U.S. Supreme Court to challenge critical features of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, features that were part of the Department of Justice's arsenal to overturn certain voter suppression legislation.\n\n[2] It is important to note, however, that voter turnout was down in comparison to 2008 except for nine states.  As of this writing it is not clear as to the sources of the decline.\n\n[3] Attacks such as Donald Trump's insulting demand that President Obama turn over his college transcripts.  The suggestion of such an action is almost unbelievable.  Nothing along those lines would have been tolerated when it came to former President George W. Bush, an individual who was not half the student that was Obama in college.\n\n[4] The right-wing, irrationalist political movement that asserts that Obama was not born in the USA and is, therefore, not the legitimate president of the USA.\n\n[5] To be clear, not all forces in the organized Left or the social movement Left engaged in left/progressive electoral organizing.  We are simply noting that there were forces from within these sectors that did, in fact, choose to engage.\n\n[6] Tecumseh:  Shawnee leader in the first decade of the 19 th century.  Recognized that Native Americans would never defeat the USA by fighting as individual tribes or fighting through the creation of a confederation.  He was the advocate for a Native American nation-state, i.e., uniting the tribes and fusing their efforts.  He was killed in 1813 at the Battle of the Thames in Canada."

      "text": "The cynical left will fade as Biden's image improves\n\nThere is a view that's now popular among self-described leftists that goes something like this. 2024 will be a choice between \"a large bowl of lukewarm watery gruel, and a flaming hot Cheeto someone dropped under the couch in 2014 that has been slightly nibbled on by mice.\"\n\nI'm not going to name the person whom I am quoting. Nor am I going to link back to the source of the original quote. I'm only quoting this self-described leftist in order to make a point about this kind of perspective, which is this: It would look like rank cynicism if not for public polling that suggests that the candidates are evenly matched. Once the polling changes, and it will, this view will look like what it is.\n\nWe should be familiar with this kind of thing by now. Every time the fortunes of the Democratic Party appear to fall, there's a (small, loud) segment of the left that piles on, blaming party leaders for not doing what they \"should be doing.\" In time, those fortunes improve, but not necessarily because party leaders did what they were \"supposed to.\" Once they improve, however, people stop listening to such leftists.\n\nWe are coming out of a period in which the fortunes of the Democrats appear to be falling and we are going into a period in which they will appear to improve. Then people will probably stop listening to such leftists or, better yet, see their criticism for what it is: rank cynicism about the promise of democratic politics that's useful to no one except those who are trying to monetize attention to their rank cynicism.\n\nWhy do Joe Biden and Donald Trump appear to be evenly matched? Because so far, there are so many people who have not been paying attention to Donald Trump since he lost the 2020 election. They can't bring themselves, for obvious and understandable reasons, to believe that he's going to be the Republican Party's presidential nominee. Something big is needed to jolt them out of this disbelief. What's needed is for Donald Trump to start winning GOP primary races.\n\nThat process began Monday with Trump's victory in Iowa. It will continue Tuesday when he wins New Hampshire. As his win tally grows, people who have not been paying attention are going to start paying attention, and with that attention will come understanding that Trump will be the nominee - that the Republicans really are going to field a candidate who's a fraud, insurrectionist and proven rapist.\n\nOnce it's clear that Trump is going to be the nominee, polling about anything related to Joe Biden is going to improve. When there was a doubt about whether Trump would be the nominee, people rated Joe Biden according to whatever was happening in that day's news. When all doubt is removed, people will rate Joe Biden according to Trump. (Trump will dominate the daily news cycle.) Judging Biden on his own terms yielded mixed results. Judging Biden relative to Trump won't.\n\nI said we are coming out of a period in which the fortunes of the Democrats appear to be falling and into a period in which they will appear to improve. Why? Consider that December poll by Ipsos showing in which people had already begun reassessing 2023 with this year's election in mind. The conventional wisdom had been that 2023 was terrible, economically, and that Biden was the blame. The Ipsos poll showed that most people believe 2023 was actually pretty good.\n\nMore evidence of this transition came out yesterday . Felix Salmon, of Axios, wrote about a new Harris poll showing that Americans are pretty happy with their personal situations. \"The Axios Vibes poll has found that when asked about their own financial condition, or that of their local community, Americans are characteristically optimistic.\"\n\n\"GDP growth is the highest in the developed world, inflation is headed back down to optimal levels, and consumer spending keeps on growing,\" he wrote. \"By the numbers: 63% of Americans rate their current financial situation as being 'good,' including 19% of us who say it's 'very good.'\"\n\nThe Harris poll mirrors the Ipsos poll in that the future looks rosy to most people. Salmon: \"66% think that 2024 will be better than 2023, and 85% of us feel we could change our personal financial situation for the better this year ... The bottom line: Americans who believe their community's economy is strong outnumber those who think it's weak. They're right.\"\n\nWhy is this transition happening? It's not because the economy has dramatically improved over the last year. It's because more people are becoming more aware of the reality they are going to be facing in the coming months. And honestly, the choice before them isn't hard. On the one hand is an incumbent who is trying to be a good president, though obviously he isn't pleasing everyone. On the other hand is Donald Trump.\n\nI said that I wasn't going to name that self-described leftist, or link back to the source of the original quote, and I'm still not going to. I don't think that view, as cynical as it is about the promise of democratic politics, is going to stay relevant. It matters now, because Trump seems strong. But he's only as strong as the degree to which most people are not paying attention to him. That's going to change, and with that, the relevance of cynical leftist commentary will fade.\n\nIf you spend time on Twitter (I won't use its official name), you have probably encountered what my friend Magdi Jacobs calls \" doomerism .\" Generally speaking, that's an attitude arising from the most extreme ends of the continuum, according to which nothing really matters in human society except the ability of one group to dominate another. It's nihilism from the far right and the far left. Both enable tyrants like Donald Trump.\n\nI'll talk more about doomerism another time. For now, I want to recognize my own recent reaction to it, which has been a generally positive attitude toward this year's election. There are a million reasons to be scared to death about the possibility of Trump being president again, but perhaps because I've been recovering from the covid, I find myself looking for at least one good reason, in the face of all this doomerism, to be hopeful.\n\nOddly enough, I found it in Trump's Big Lie. As I was thinking about his endless lying about voter fraud, it occurred to me that he's subliminally communicating something that many of us are not hearing, on account of so many of us being so scared to death. Trump is saying that \"I know I can't win, otherwise, I wouldn't be explaining why I'm about to lose.\"\n\nI wrote that piece Thursday . I thought it was pretty good. By Friday, something happened to make me think that it was very good. According to CNN, Joe Biden has decided that a major piece of his campaign strategy is calling Trump a \"loser.\" He's been using that word every day since.\n\nHe was in South Carolina over the weekend, campaigning in advance of that state's Democratic primary election. To an audience of supporters, Biden said: \"You are the reason I'm president. You are the reason Kamala Harris is a historic vice president. You are the reason Donald Trump is a loser. And you are the reason we are going to win and beat him again.\"\n\nNearly a month ago, also in South Carolina, in remarks on the third anniversary of the J6 insurrection, the president said : \"Let's be clear about the 2020 election. Trump exhausted every legal avenue available to him to overturn the election - every one. But the legal path just took Trump back to the truth that I had won the election and he was a loser.\"\n\nAfter Trump won the Iowa caucuses, Biden said: \"You know, it's kind of funny: all these Republican candidates in the primary trying to beat Donald Trump, and I'm still the only person to beat Donald Trump.\"\n\nCNN picked up on the idea on Friday. \"Biden has laid out the stakes of the election in as stark terms as any American election ever. But as serious as he is about what's at stake for democracy in 2024, aides to the president's reelection campaign tell CNN that the needling will keep up as they shift fully into general election mode - even if it prompts criticism that the president has let himself be dragged into Trump's way of playing politics.\"\n\nThis should give up hope.\n\nFor one thing, Biden is taking the high road and the low road at the same time. If American democracy really is on the line, and it is, then Biden is showing a willingness to do whatever it takes to defend it, even if that means getting down in the mud to face off with the chief mudslinger.\n\nFor another, and more importantly, this could end up being the most effective way of neutralizing the destructive power of the Big Lie. As I said Thursday, in repeating it, over and over, Trump is saying, subliminally, that \"I know I can't win, otherwise, I wouldn't be explaining why I'm about to lose.\" By calling Donald Trump a loser, and by doing that every day, Biden is taking what's now subliminal and making it obvious to all.\n\nI think it's hard to overstate how crucial that is. The Big Lie asks people to believe that there are dark and mysterious forces at work in America that are so big and malicious and entrenched that the only way to get what you want is to throw out the practice of democracy and start anew. In this story, Trump is the champion of something huge and noble, and that can be appealing to people who have only a passing interest in politics.\n\nIn calling Trump a loser, however, the president is reducing the Big Lie's \"nobility\" down to its base parts, as if to say: No, Trump isn't fighting for justice. He isn't fighting the \"deep state.\" He isn't fighting for you . He's a loser, and he's doing what losers do - explaining, over and over, why he can't win in the hopes of duping you into believing that he's not a loser.\n\nLeft to its own devices, Trump's Big Lie is an existential threat to the republic. The president, however, is putting that threat in its proper context so that people with only a passing interest in politics - which, let's face it, includes most people - can see that there's nothing heroic about it. Trump is a con man who's doing what con men do. The Big Lie attempts to preempt democracy. Biden is preempting that preemption in the name of democracy. Best of all, his campaign understands that.\n\n\"It is Donald Trump who continues to deny the truth about the 2020 election,\" campaign advisor TJ Ducklo told CNN. \"Joe Biden is a winner. He won that one. Donald Trump is a loser. He lost that one. So us calling him a loser is simply a response to an issue that he continues to raise himself.\"\n\nThis is more needling on Biden's part. This is more than taunting. It's neutralizing what is for Donald Trump his most powerful weapon. That alone is reason to hope, and for giving doomerism a pass for the day.\n\nTwo of Donald Trump's co-defendants in the Georgia election theft case plead guilty last week and a third followed suit on Tuesday.\n\nFormer Trump lawyers Sidney Powell, Kenneth Chesebro and Jenna Ellis have agreed to testify against the former president and the remaining co-defendants. Assuming they successfully complete their probation, none of these newly minted convicts will face prison time.\n\nThe remaining defendants, including Trump, are being prosecuted under Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute, a law that was originally designed to fight organized crime, but which is now being applied to various illegal networks.\n\nPowell's decision to plead guilty on the eve of her trial came as a shock to the Trump camp. \"[Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and her team] managed to break the woman who was never supposed to be breakable,\" a deluded person told Rolling Stone . Powell will go to her grave believing conspiracy theories, but her loyalty to Donald Trump is not inexhaustible. Trump threw Powell under the bus publicly, ridiculed her privately, and cut off all contact.\n\nChesebro pled guilty to a single felony count of conspiracy to file false documents in connection with his role in the fake electors scam. Powell didn't even have to concede that much. She was allowed to plead to six misdemeanors. She'll be free to file more frivolous lawsuits someday. But before you start complaining about our rigged justice system, consider how much these two have to offer as witnesses.\n\nWhy did the lawyers get such generous plea deals? Because they can testify against defendants who are even guiltier than they are. Mid-level conspirators are particularly useful if they can testify to both the orders of the ringleaders and the operational details of the scheme. Snitching will get you everywhere.\n\nThe lawyers worked directly with Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman and Donald Trump himself. Powell met with Trump in the Oval Office and presented him with a blueprint for declaring martial law and seizing voting machines. Her proposal was not acted upon, but the mere fact that she had that kind of access speaks volumes.\n\nCritically, the lawyers can testify that the flurry of illegal activity to overturn the election was a conspiracy. That may sound obvious, but proving the existence of an illicit network to a legal certainty can be a big hurdle for a RICO case. The more insiders who can explain how the pieces fit together, the more likely Willis is to secure RICO convictions.\n\nPowell has something else going for her as a cooperating witness. She has now pled guilty to orchestrating the theft of voter data from Coffee County. A bail bondsman named Scott Hall has already pled guilty to his role in the theft. Critically, the indictment asserts that Hall was working on behalf of Donald Trump. If Hall and Powell can link the Coffee County heist to Trump, that would be a boon to the prosecution's case against the highest-value defendant of all.\n\nThe lawyers also had the advantage of being among the first to plead guilty. Prosecutors want to leverage the prisoner's dilemma to create a sense of urgency: If nobody talks, everybody walks; but the person who talks first gets the best deal. Powell and Chesebro were the first nationally known defendants to plead guilty. Rest assured that the remaining co-defendants are watching carefully. Now that the united front is beginning to crumble, others may fold as well.\n\nIt's not sunshine and rainbows, though. Powell's cachet as a witness might be tarnished by her long history of spouting outlandish conspiracy theories starring Hugo Chavez, George Soros and other fan faves from the QAnon cinematic universe. Trump's lawyers will try to undermine her credibility. They must tread carefully, however.\n\nThe more they paint Powell as crazy, the harder it's going to be to justify Trump's decision to rely on her advice. Trump's defense will likely hinge on his sincere belief that the election was stolen. And yet there's already testimony from the J6 Committee that Trump dismissed Powell's conspiracy theories as crazy.\n\nThe defections of three well-placed co-defendants in the Georgia RICO case is a huge blow to Trump and his top lieutenants.\n\nOhio Congressman Jim Jordan's bid for speaker ended suddenly Friday when the Republican conference dropped him like a hot rock. All the bullying, threats and bluster failed to persuade a critical faction of \"moderates.\" Nine Republicans have since emerged to vie for the job. Of those, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer is the most prominent.\n\nThese nine represent the third time the Republicans have gone through this since the historic Oct. 3 tossing of Kevin McCarthy. The House has been paralyzed since. A government shutdown looms. Wars in Ukraine and Israel need attention. Yet the Republican majority can't do the most basic thing of any majority - pick a leader. Anything could happen, but it looks like a new speaker any time soon is a long shot.\n\nWhile it's natural to associate the chaos with Donald Trump , the roots of the Republican disorder are deeper. Thomas Mann, a traditional liberal, and Norman Ornstein, a traditional conservative, wrote what I have come to think of as the Ur-text all the way back in April 2012. In \" Let's just say it: The Republicans are the problem ,\" they write that:\n\n\"We have been studying Washington politics and Congress for more than 40 years, and never have we seen them this dysfunctional. In our past writings, we have criticized both parties when we believed it was warranted. Today, however, we have no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the problem lies with the Republican Party.\"\n\n\"The GOP has become an insurgent outlier in American politics,\" they added. \"It is ideologically extreme; scornful of compromise; unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science; and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.\"\n\nWho's to blame? Before Trump, there was Grover Norquist, the anti-tax evangelist who made it verboten for any Republican to talk about budgets in any responsible way. They could talk about cuts, but never revenues. And before Norquist, there was Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who went to war with the institution itself.\n\nTogether, Gingrich and Norquist created conditions in which it's not a matter of both sides, Mann and Ornstein said. \"When one party moves this far from the mainstream, it makes it nearly impossible for the political system to deal constructively with the country's challenges.\"\n\nMann and Ornstein's piece was prescient. The Republicans were the problem before Trump, Russian sabotage, the impeachments, the insurrection, the pandemic - and before the \"insurgent outliers\" narrowly won the House only to succumb a year later to the chaos and disorder that brought them there. Recently, I asked Ornstein if his assessment has changed. No, he suggested, except it's gotten worse.\n\nOhio Congressman Jim Jordan is now whipping holdouts in the Republican conference in a bid to become the next speaker. If he succeeds, the House will become more chaotic than it already is. He doesn't care about governing. He doesn't care about dealmaking. There's one thing that Jordan cares about - sabotaging democracy.\n\nRecall that Jordan was one of Donald Trump's closest allies in his 2021 criminal conspiracy and attempted paramilitary takeover of the US government. According to former Wyoming Congresswoman Liz Cheney, who co-chaired the committee that investigated the J6 insurrection, Jordan knew more about what Trump \"had planned for January 6th than any other member of the House of Representatives.\"\n\nCheney added that Jordan \"was involved, was part of the conspiracy in which Donald Trump was engaged as he attempted to overturn the election.\" If the House Republican elected him as speaker, she said, \"there would no longer be any possible way to argue that a group of elected Republicans could be counted on to defend the Constitution.\"\n\nGoverning has no meaning to Jordan. There's a government to fund by Nov. 17. There are foreign allies (Ukraine against Russia, Israel against Hamas) to support. But those are not the first thing on the mind of someone who's seeking the speakership. According to Jill Lawrence, Jordan has in his sites \"a highly partisan, likely illegal, and definitely expensive\" gambit \"to eliminate funding that would be used\" to process or release immigrants who are legally seeking asylum. There's a country to run, but Jordan can't be bothered, though bothering is exactly what you'd expect from the second-in-line to the presidency.\n\nJordan has no business being speaker. None. He hasn't accomplished anything , because, according to Heather Cox Richardson, legislative accomplishments are beside the point for a \"flamethrower who, in 16 years in the House, has not managed to get a single bill through the House, let alone into law.\" She added that \"Jordan's elevation would reflect that for many years now, Republicans have elevated those who disdain government and whose goal is to stop it from working.\"\n\nA speaker, especially one who leads in a time of divided government like ours, must make deals. There's no way the Democrats or the president will agree to a provision that would stop funding for the legal processing and release of immigrants who are legally seeking asylum given that, you know, they are legally seeking asylum . We can probably expect a Speaker Jordan to add poison to any legislation that might keep the governing running beyond Nov. 17, knowing full well that the Democrats will object. It doesn't matter, though. He'll just go on Fox to blame the opposition. Meanwhile, the country sinks further into chaos.\n\nThat's probably the point. More than anyone in the Congress, Jordan may represent an idea that's growing among the most extreme Republicans. It's that democracy is no longer stable enough to produce outcomes in keeping with the founders' vision of the republic, and that what's needed to restore order is a strong man. This idea goes by many names, the most convincing I think is fascism. But lately, fascism has gotten a fashionable upgrade. It's being called \"Red Caesarism.\"\n\nLindsay Beyerstein explained last week in the Editorial Board . \"The argument riffs on Julius Caesar's decision to cross the Rubicon with his army and return to Rome to become a dictator. Proponents like to say that Caesarism is better than democracy because it's more stable.\" But, she added, \"Caesar sustained one-man rule for less than a year before being assassinated. His gory death sparked a series of civil wars that ended the Roman Republic and ushered in the Roman Empire. The fact that anyone regards this dismal period as aspirational is disturbing.\"\n\nThe strong man in question is Donald Trump, the same one who sought to overturn a free and fair election that many Republicans have lost faith in, precisely because it produced an outcome, and hinted at future outcomes, in which \"conservatives\" - or native-born fascists - have no chance of winning. It is because they face the likelihood of losing free and fair elections that these same fascists no longer seek stability but instead chaos for which their solution is a Red Caesar.\n\nBut of course they can't just come out and say any of the above. They must instead prove that democracy is unstable - thus justifying the disenfranchisement of voters across the country - and what better way of doing that than by installing as speaker of the US House of Representatives a figure, second-in-line to the presidency, who has accomplished not one thing legislatively in his 16 years on the job?\n\nThe truth is that democracy can be very unstable, especially when there are so many people in key states around the republic who are predisposed by birth or upbringing to be dead-set against the concept, norms, practices and institutions of democracy to such a hateful degree that they elect people like Jim Jordan to sabotage democracy.\n\nVivek Ramaswamy is having a moment. After last night's first debate among GOP hopefuls, an Associated Press headline said he's taken \" center stage .\"\n\nThe tech entrepreneur, the AP reported , \"has crept up in recent polls, leading to his position next to [Florida Governor Ron] DeSantis at center stage. And he quickly showed why when he showcased his ready-for-video, on-message approach - talking about how his poor parents moved to the US and gave him the chance to found billion-dollar companies.\"\n\nHis moment won't last, though, and he will guarantee its end.\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\nRamaswamy is playing a familiar role in a very old American story - that of the nonwhite man who says things that white men are not supposed to say, making it OK for them to say them, thus ensuring his political irrelevance - until the next time white men need a nonwhite man to repeat the pattern.\n\nIf you listen carefully, you can hear Ramaswamy trying to sound like Donald Trump. His rhetoric involves conspiracy theories, stupendously false claims, and winks and nods to racists and revanchists. It's in the hope that GOP voters who are concerned about Trump's baggage might come over to his side. But in the end, they won't need him. They have what they want.\n\nLast night featured the clearest example of what I'm talking about. At one point, Ramaswamy said that \"the climate change agenda is a hoax. ... More people are dying from bad climate change policy than they are of climate change.\" I don't need to remind you that Trump said the same thing during the 2016 cycle without the debate-club polish that Ramaswamy brings to it.\n\nBut that was only the clearest example. Like Donald Trump's rhetoric, Vivek Ramaswamy's usually features elements of anti-Black dog whistling and conspiratorial innuendo. These flatter the listener into believing that they're both too sophisticated to accept the conventional wisdom of a democracy that's growing more diverse. While everyone else feels forced to talk in terms of \"political correctness,\" they are free to speak the plain truth.\n\nThat works for Trump, because, at this point, he now speaks as \"the symbol of white Christian entitlement and power in a rapidly changing country,\" said Robert Jones, head of the Public Religion Research Institute and author of the new book, The Hidden Roots of White Supremacy . Jones told Ronald Brownstein recently that \"MAGA, with its siren song of loss and nostalgia in that final word 'again', was crafted as a rallying cry for this sentiment.\"\n\nJones added: \"Trump's attacks on the legitimacy of elections he lost, a federal government that is persecuting him and his followers, and racist Black prosecutors all derive power from this world view, where the white Christian inhabitants of the promised land are being denied their rightful divine inheritance by those who were meant to be subservient \" (my italics).\n\nRamaswamy can't do that.\n\nHe's not white, first of all. (He was born in Cincinnati to south Indian immigrants). Second, he's not Christian. He's Hindu. (The Times reported on a white evangelical voter who \"looked up his religion and saw he's Hindu.\" He said, \"I was going to vote for him until that came up.\") Despite his best efforts to sound like Donald Trump, he'll always remind these \"white Christian inhabitants of the promised land\" that people like him are denying their rightful divine inheritance when they \"were meant to be subservient.\"\n\nRamaswamy isn't stupid. He can sense the deep desire among \"white Christian inhabitants\" - or, as I have called them, \" Realamericans \" - for the \"subservient\" to adopt their way of thinking. He can sense their desire to hear someone who looks like him tell them what they want to hear.\n\nSo he's giving it to them.\n\nBut in the process of telling Realamericans that they are right, and that non-Realamericans are wrong, he's making it OK for Trump to keep being what he's become, \"the symbol of white Christian entitlement and power.\" And the more he validates Donald Trump, the less these Realamericans are going to need Ramaswamy. He's served his function. Now he's done.\n\nAs I said, this is an old American story. Many ambitious nonwhite men have tried doing what Ramaswamy is attempting. Like him, they believed they were smart enough to outdo white power. In the end, it outdid them.\n\nI think one of the unintended consequences of consuming daily amounts of rightwing media, and nothing else per day, is that some Republicans came to believe that most Americans agreed with them on abortion. If it wasn't murder, it was certainly a matter best left to the states. By the time the US Supreme Court overturned Roe , they believed that the majority was on their side.\n\nThen, once regulatory authority was returned to the states, the Republicans quickly realized that their antiabortion views were not as representative as their daily consumption of rightwing media had them believe. They quickly realized that the majority was against them.\n\nTuesday's vote in Ohio , in which voters rejected a proposal that would have stopped movement toward enshrining abortion rights in the state's constitution, is only the most recent in a series of events to show that states' rights are not what the Republicans had hoped they'd be.\n\nAnd now that states' rights are backfiring in some states, some GOP voters are reversing themselves. They are warming up to the idea of using what they would call \"Big Government\" to get what they want. In the process, they are revealing their true position on states' rights.\n\nAnd that they don't know what to do post- Roe .\n\nAfter the Dobbs ruling, 83 percent of GOP voters said that politicians \"should leave decisions on abortion restrictions up to the states\" rather than \"push for further restrictions on abortion nationwide,\" according to the Post 's Aaron Blake, who looked at polling last summer by CNN.\n\nBut today, Blake said , the percentage of GOP voters who prefer that politicians enact a national ban on abortion \"has doubled, to 34 percent. They now lean in favor of state-level restrictions 66 percent to 34 percent.\" It's another example of the rightwing media's influence.\n\nBlake is right to say that too much can be said of this. He's also right to say that these things often start small and snowball. The GOP pushed to overturn Roe for decades without expecting to succeed. The next few years could see a similarly cynical push, paving the way, when political conditions are right, for what could be an actual national ban.\n\n\"Should the party continue to drift in favor of supporting federal restrictions,\" Blake wrote, \"that could apply pressure on congressional Republicans and GOP presidential candidates to move in that direction.\"\n\nBut I think we should be mindful of the larger point about the Republicans' true position on states' rights. They're for states' rights when they yield the right results but against them when they don't.\n\nAnd we should also be mindful of this - they don't know what to do.\n\nThey don't know what to do about the already mentioned backlash. It's not letting up. Nor do they know what to do about an executive branch that is rapidly deregulating the \" pregnancy market ,\" as I once put it.\n\nThe Biden administration approved a birth-control pill -- called Opill -- for sale over-the-counter without a doctor's prescription. It also changed a rule to allow the so-called abortion pill (mifepristone) to be distributed by retail pharmacies, not just hospitals and clinics.\n\nThe Republicans also don't know what to do about a new underground abortion-pill railroad of sorts. Democratic states that permit most forms of abortion are passing shield laws to protect doctors in those states who are shipping mifepristone by mail to pregnant people in Republican states that restrict most, or all, forms of abortion.\n\nThey don't know what to do because the available arguments against deregulating the pregnancy market are typically GOP arguments. Republicans generally favor deregulating everything, including abortion. Remember, Dobbs returned power to regulate to the states.\n\nNow that those arguments have been co-opted and made operational by the opposition, the Republicans are left to talk about absurdities, like ending \" abortion tourism \" or enacting a national ban on abortion, both of which come back to revealing their true position on states' rights.\n\nThey don't know what to do now that Roe has been shattered into political units much smaller than states, and now that matters of abortion are being decided pharmacy by pharmacy, mailbox by mailbox.\n\nLast week, I said that Ron DeSantis is losing because he's bad at this. He could sit out this presidential cycle and wait for Joe Biden's tenure to expire. But, I said, he seems to believe the hype about him - that he's Not-Donald Trump but also Donald Trump II. Just one problem, I said: Everything in Republican politics begins and ends with Donald Trump.\n\nThe Florida man seems eager to convince hesitant Republican voters that they have nowhere else to go but to him. \"They do have nowhere else to go,\" I wrote, \"but not for the reasons DeSantis thinks. There's no Donald Trump II. There's no Not-Donald Trump. There's only Donald Trump.\"\n\nThen came news Tuesday that DeSantis \"is replacing his presidential campaign manager and making other changes to his senior staff after a rough stretch of layoffs, budget woes and struggles to make headway against ... the front-runner for the Republican nomination,\" the Post said .\n\nWhen a candidate gets rid of a campaign manager, that's a bad sign, bad enough for The Bulwark 's Jonathan Last to write DeSantis' obituary .\n\nI don't know whether DeSantis' campaign is dead or not. But I do know that political history is chock-full of examples of primary underdogs who were forced to make radical changes in the face of struggle. I don't know what that change will be exactly, but DeSantis seems to already understand that change is necessary - and not only because his campaign is in trouble.\n\nHe seems to understand that Trump is a liability.\n\nDuring an interview with NBC News' Dasha Burns Monday, he said that \"if the election is a referendum on Joe Biden's policies and the failures that we've seen and we are presenting a positive vision for the future, we will win the presidency and we will have a chance to turn the country around.\"\n\nBut, Florida's second-term governor added, \"if the election is not about January 20, 2025, but January 6, 2021, or what document was left by the toilet at Mar-a-Lago, if it's a referendum on that, we are going to lose.\"\n\nIn other words, if Trump is the GOP's nominee, the election is going to be about him and his crimes. And if it's about them, Joe Biden is going to win.\n\nPaul Waldman, a liberal writer, said as much Sunday . \"Any election in which Donald Trump is involved will be almost entirely about Donald Trump,\" he said. \"And that is not good for his party. Republicans fared poorly in all three elections since he won the presidency in 2016, and each poor performance can be attributed in large part to Trump's malign influence.\"\n\nWhich brings me back to DeSantis. If he's going to make a change to save his campaign, he probably should stop what he's been doing - avoiding direct confrontation with Donald Trump - and start doing something else. Fortunately, another underdog, Chris Christie, is modeling an alternative.\n\nThe former New Jersey governor has turned his long shot campaign into a mission to \"tell Republican voters the truth\" about Trump, he said during an interview with \"CBS News Sunday Morning.\" He has been rewarded for that decision. Politico said Tuesday that he's \"the field's loudest Trump critic.\"\n\nOn MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" Wednesday, Christie asked : \"How were the American people benefited by him keeping boxes of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. That was just there for him to continue to pretend that he was president and to show off for people who were on the back patio. ... The great irony of this campaign is Donald Trump saying he's going to put America first. He has not put America first. He's put Donald Trump first.\"\n\nNow, just because Christie is modeling an alternative for DeSantis to follow doesn't mean necessarily that DeSantis should. Christie is good at this. He's comfortable trading insults with Trump, and the more they trade insults, the better things will be for Christie as \"the field's loudest Trump critic.\"\n\nBut DeSantis, as I said, is bad at this - or at least he appears to be. Maybe that's the result of trying to do the impossible. He's selling himself as the Not-Donald Trump candidate who also wants the support of Donald Trump's followers. Impossible situations can make anyone look foolish.\n\nStill, DeSantis is facing a crisis. He has to decide. He could continue avoiding direct confrontation with Donald Trump. That hasn't worked. Or he could engage in direct confrontations - and in the process give a Republican candidacy, if not his own candidacy, a chance of beating Joe Biden. That might work, but, again, it depends on how good he is at it.\n\nChristie is very good.\n\nIs DeSantis?\n\nAs you can imagine, I pay a lot of attention to the news. Indeed, paying attention is half the labor that goes into producing the Editorial Board . Normal people, as I say, have better things to do than pay attention to politics. Way I see it, my job is to pay attention for the common good.\n\nI guess I've been slacking. This morning, I learned something that's been established fact for four months, but, well, I don't know what I have been doing since March. I don't know how I missed it - this fact is that big.\n\nI guess I shouldn't be too hard on myself. That someone like me, who pays a lot of attention to the news, missed something so big says less about me than it does about the news producers to whom I pay a lot of attention.\n\nWhat's the news? Here's the Post , my italics:\n\n\"A year after inflation soared to the highest level in four decades, price increases are returning closer to normal levels, with families and businesses feeling the difference as wages rise faster than prices and policymakers debate how much more to slow the economy.\"\n\nYou'll notice I did not stress the top item. Prices are returning to normal levels. Huzzah! No one here has not felt the pain of paying too much for bacon and eggs. But prices have been the focus of the press and pundit corps for months, years , at least since the covid closed the economy. Wages, on the other hand, don't get nearly the same degree of focus.\n\nMoreover, the press and pundit corps habitually mangle the real and serious difference between prices and inflation. Prices are what you pay for stuff. Inflation is a systemic economic force. Inflation does indeed affect prices. Prices in turn affect inflation. But they are not the same. News producers often treat them as equal. The result is public confusion.\n\nFact is, normal people, which is to say, people who have better things to do than pay attention to politics, probably don't know what inflation is and probably don't care. What they know about is that the cost of bacon and eggs has been too high too long. What they care about is affording them.\n\nInflation has been slowing down for nearly a year now , but normal people, naturally, aren't feeling it. They aren't focused on systemic economic forces! They're focused on the price of bacon and eggs! But the press and pundit corps have so mangled the difference that normal people blame inflation for their pain when they should blame prices - and those who set them.\n\nInflation is a nameless faceless force. There's no one to blame.\n\nPrices are not nameless and faceless.\n\nThe firms that provide most of the food that we eat are small in number. Their pricing power, however, is huge. Eighty percent of \"everyday grocery items are supplied by a handful of companies,\" according to a 2021 investigation by The Guardian . \"Three firms dominate sales of 73 percent\" of breakfast cereals, while \"more than 80 percent beef processing and 70 percent of pork processing is controlled by four multinational giants.\"\n\nBut remember what I put in italics?\n\nI didn't stress prices. I didn't stress inflation.\n\nI stressed wages.\n\nWages are rising faster than inflation. \"Average hourly earnings rose 0.4 percent from May to June, outpacing inflation by 0.2 percent, according to a separate BLS report released Wednesday,\" the Post reported. In fact, it said, \"wages have grown faster than inflation for four straight months.\"\n\nLet's say that again.\n\nLet's say that again time with feeling , and in the knowledge that the press and pundit corps have, over the last four months, produced about four billion stories about normal people \" still feeling the pain of inflation .\"\n\nWages have grown faster than inflation for four straight months!\n\nNot only are normal people bringing in more money than they're paying out, they have been bringing in more money since the first quarter!\n\nI'll be honest with you.\n\nI said, at the top, that I don't know how I missed this - this fact is really that big. But as you probably have guessed by now, I'm being coy. I do know how.\n\nI pay a lot of attention to the news, but, like any normal person in any democracy, I know only what news producers produce. If they habitually mangle the real and serious difference between inflation and prices, while making of fetish of \"still feeling the pain of inflation,\" what else can I do?\n\nFortunately, luck was on my side.\n\nOn my computer, actually.\n\nIn one tab, I had open the Post story I have been talking about. That version was about prices finally coming down. In another tab, I had open the same story, but updated to include news about wages outpacing prices. (Both mangle the difference between prices and inflation, treating them as synonymous.)\n\nI pay a lot of attention to the news, for normal people who have better things to do than pay attention to politics, but only luck allowed me to notice that the same news story in the Post had two subheadlines.\n\nFour billion stories about \"the pain of inflation.\"\n\nWill the next four months bring more stories about rising wages?\n\nJoe Biden ran for president as Mr. Normalcy. During the pandemic, with the body count rising and the economy teetering, he looked pretty good next to a lying, thieving, philandering sadist who refused to lead the nation or take responsibility for it. Compared to Donald Trump, Biden was a no-brainer. All he had to do was stand up straight, brush his teeth and comb his hair.\n\nBut Biden is not Mr. Normalcy, never was. He's long denied this fact, to be sure, for reasons good and bad, but he seems to have changed his mind. During a speech in Chicago , he embraced the fact that he is what his former boss had wanted to be: a transformational president. \"Bidenomics is working,\" he said. \"The American people strongly support Bidenomics.\"\n\nThis is a BFD , and not because Biden is taking possession of an insult hurled at him by the GOP. (That, in fact, is not a BFD; it's a clever perspective intended for people who believe themselves to be clever.) \"Bidenomics\" is real, new and, most of all, believable. That its namesake is self-consciously embracing it, indeed running for reelection on it, is a BFD. He's saying the old political order is dead, and vote for me and I'll make sure it stays dead.\n\n\"Bidenomics\" is real . The economy keeps adding jobs at rates unseen since the 1960s. Private companies hired nearly half a million people last month, doubling expectations . (Inflation has also been slowing down, for months ).\n\n\"Bidenomics\" is new . The last time the federal government invested in the economy, in the way that it's currently investing in it, was six decades ago, which also happens to be the last time jobs were added at historic rates.\n\n\"Government is no longer shying away from pushing investment toward specific goals and industries,\" according to the Post 's EJ Dionne. \"Spending on public works is back in fashion. New free-trade treaties are no longer at the heart of the nation's international strategy. Challenging monopolies and providing support for unionization efforts are higher priorities.\"\n\nBut the biggest reason \"Bidenomics\" is a BFD is that it's believable .\n\nSince I came of age in the 1980s, most people most of the time have been receptive to the claim that \"government interference\" in a free market - taxing wealth, regulating critical industries, expanding opportunities, public works - is something akin to socialism. To be sure, no one knew what socialism was, not even the so-called socialists. It just sounded right.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnnell said that the president's student debt-relief program is \"student loan socialism.\" Thirty years ago, that would likely have made a loud clang . But it doesn't sound right anymore. It can't.\n\nFor one thing, the Great (Long) Recession showed everyone that a free market isn't really free. If you're too big to fail, you're also too big to jail - full stop. For another, the pandemic showed everyone that \"government interference\" isn't as bad as its reputation, given that we might be dead without it. The lucky survivors among us would be much poorer, too.\n\nSo Biden is not arguing that the old political order is dead. He's pointing his finger at the corpse and saying, look, it's dead. In Chicago, he declared that the regime of the last 40 years, which included the economic policies of his two Democratic predecessors, is no longer viable. New conditions, new challenges and new urgencies call for the establishment of a new regime.\n\nNormal presidents try to appear to break from the past.\n\nTransformational presidents do not try to appear to break. They break.\n\nBut the past was already broken.\n\nBiden is not leading the way toward regime change as much as he's leading the way toward a new consensus that the old regime has changed, has been changing. The old regime (sometimes called \"neoliberalism,\" sometimes called \"Reaganomics,\" named after Ronald Reagan) started OK. It privileged tax cuts, deregulation, privatization and free trade. But that was at the expense of normal people, their standards of living, and the democracies they inhabited. The old regime was great - if you were very obscenely rich.\n\nEven so, every president since 1980, including Biden's former boss, has defended and protected a political order that over time immiserated the middle class. (Wages were higher in the 1960s, adjusted for inflation, than they are today, though, thanks to \"Bidenomics,\" they are catching up .)\n\nJoe Biden is the first president in my lifetime, going back to Richard Nixon, to self-consciously take the side of people who work for a living while also self-consciously making enemies of people who own so much they don't have to work. That's a transformational president. That's regime change.\n\nThat's a BFD.\n\nRobert F Kennedy, Jr. cannot help himself. In his quixotic bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, he initially sought to distance himself from the 15-year crusade against vaccines that has defined him as a public figure. But this week he reverted to form, making outrageous claims during a panel discussion that he convened with fellow antivaxers and advertised on his campaign channels.\n\n\"I do not believe that infectious disease is an enormous threat to human health,\" Kennedy said on the livestream, a bold statement in the wake of more than a million excess deaths in the US in its first two years. Kennedy also pledged to target medical journals and defund epidemiology if elected, according to Rolling Stone .\n\nAnd that was just the beginning.\n\nHe falsely claimed that vaccine research created HIV, the Spanish flu and Lyme disease. He has previously insinuated that HIV doesn't cause AIDS, and that the only reason all reputable scientists think it does is because his nemesis, White House covid czar, Anthony Fauci nixed funding for research into alternative theories.\n\nWhen Kennedy threw his hat into the ring, many observers were surprised that his campaign website was silent on the vaccine issue, as the candidate sought to rebrand himself as a normal Democrat who criticizes corporate power while reminding boomers of his dead relatives.\n\nThe reputational rehab was never going to be easy.\n\nKennedy made his name as an antivaxer by doggedly promoting the debunked link between vaccines and autism. The pandemic dramatically raised Kennedy's profile as an opponent of public health measures and vaccine mandates. He published a bestselling book that spins an elaborate and baseless conspiracy theory about how Fauci knowingly denied Americans access to effective covid treatments because the vaccine couldn't be authorized if treatments were available. In fact, Kennedy's pet therapies were tested and found worthless and had there been an effective drug treatment for covid, it would have made no effect on the vaccine's approval process.\n\nVanity Fair dubbed him \"the antivax icon of America's nightmares.\" A well-earned moniker, given that Kennedy founded Children's Health Defense (CHD), the most influential antivax group in the country. CHD stoked panic about the measles vaccine in Samoa and helped cause an outbreak that killed about 50 babies and toddlers.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Kennedy became notorious for likening vaccine mandates to the Holocaust. Kennedy is also a prolific spreader of conspiracy theories , including the rumor that 5G networks are being used to \"harvest our data and control our behavior.\" What's more, former Donald Trump advisor Steven Bannon keeps bragging about how he convinced Kennedy to run to spread the antivax gospel.\n\nDespite his aspirations to court normie Democrats, Kennedy can't resist the adulation of his real base - online cranks.\n\nThe pandemic made Kennedy a superstar on the right and he prefers the fawning attention of conspiracy-minded podcaster Joe Rogan to the slightly tougher questions of the beltway media. Kennedy's antivax antics on the campaign trail ramped up sharply after his appearance on Rogan's show. The candidate also got drawn into a bizarre harassment campaign of vaccine scientist Peter Hotez, who declined to debate Kennedy on Rogan's show, on the grounds any debate with Kennedy would devolve into the \"Jerry Springer Show.\" Billionaires like Elon Musk rushed in to defend Kennedy and smear Hotez. Hotez was deluged with abuse online and antivax YouTubers even showed up at his home.\n\nThis week Kennedy got the band back together, convening a panel on public health featuring some of the antivax movement's most notorious figures, which he promoted through official campaign channels. Kennedy's guests included fellow members of the Disinformation Dozen, a rogues gallery that's collectively responsible for the majority of online antivax content. One of his guests, Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, testified before the Ohio Statehouse that covid vaccines make people magnetic and create \"5G interfaces\" to link our bodies to cellular networks.\n\n\"You can put a key on their forehead, it sticks,\" Tenpenny told Ohio legislators in 2021, \"You can put spoons and forks all over and they can stick because now we think there is a metal piece to that.\"\n\nPerhaps Kennedy is returning to his antivax roots because the rest of his program is at odds with the Democratic base. He rejects common sense gun reform and instead blames school shootings on antidepressants; he dismisses US defense aid to Ukraine as a NATO proxy war against Russia; he refuses to criticize Donald Trump and says he's proud the former president likes him.\n\nThe first thing you need to know about Thursday's ruling by the United States Supreme Court, striking down the use of race in college admissions, is this: affirmative action affected a small group of people, and would have continued to affect a small group of people had the high court decided to leave it be.\n\nRemember that we're talking about elite institutions. Very few colleges are so picky that they must use race to cull applicants. As Rod Graham once said , most clamor for enrollees. Only the elites \"are in a position to use race as a factor and choose some students over others,\" he said. \"Your average State U, liberal arts college or local community college does not have that luxury.\"\n\nThe second thing you need to know is that all colleges, elites included, will continue racially diversifying their student bodies, because it's in their interest to continue doing so. They won't do it as they have been, now that the justices have decided. Indeed, the means will change. The goals, however, will not.\n\nThe third thing you need to know is that the Supreme Court did not outlaw affirmative action, as action in the affirmative is going to continue to be taken whenever the sons and daughters of the very obscenely rich apply for admission to the elite schools that their very obscenely rich parents went to.\n\nThis third thing is, I think, the most important thing.\n\nThe court did not take up the question of admissions policies that give a leg up to the sons and daughters of the very obscenely rich. It took up the question of admissions policies that give a leg up to nonwhite people. It did not ban bias, but a kind of bias - a kind that's disliked by the court's rightwing supermajority.\n\nBias in favor of the very obscenely rich may continue.\n\nBias in favor of nonwhite people must stop.\n\nIn writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts seems blind to actions taken in the affirmative for the sons and daughters of the very obscenely rich. Students, he said, should be considered on the merits alone, not the color of their skin. \"Our constitutional history does not tolerate that choice,\" he said .\n\nBut students are never considered for admittance on the merits alone.\n\nHarvard's acceptance rate was 6 percent between 2014 and 2019. (By contrast, the acceptance rate of the University of Connecticut was 55.6 percent.) Of all the kids who applied, Harvard accepted less than a tenth. Of that number, the sons and daughters of the very obscenely rich represented 33 percent.\n\nContrary to Roberts' belief, our constitutional history has tolerated bias and continues to tolerate it. The question is, and always has been, bias in favor of whom and why? For this court, the question is closed to nonwhite people.\n\nIs affirmative action reverse-racism? No. It arose from the 1960s, a time in which one kind of politics defeated another kind - specifically, agents of the civil rights movement defeating agents of Jim Crow apartheid. The hope was to ameliorate some of the injuries wrought by slavery and its racist vestiges.\n\nAccording to Allison Wiltz, affirmative action aimed initially \"to ensure equal employment opportunities among contractors working for the federal government.\" Instead of \"retroactively mitigating discrimination,\" she wrote, the Kennedy administration ordered contractors to \"take affirmative action.\"\n\nIn its proper context, one can see that the consideration of race in college admissions is the point of affirmative action. It is not reverse racism. It is an attempt to amend for the country's long history of racial discrimination.\n\nThat's the problem for affirmative action's critics. Their aim has always been to replace programs, like college admissions, that were intended to consider race in an attempt to amend for the country's long history of racial discrimination with programs that are \"colorblind.\" That way attempts to amend for the country's history of racial discrimination seem like racial discrimination.\n\nAmericans have never been colorblind. We only makebelieve we are. With this ruling, however, the Supreme Court has given makebelieve the force of law. Not only may bias in favor of the very obscenely rich continue. Bias in favor of makebelieve must replace bias in favor of real attempts to make things right.\n\nIt bears repeating that there are enough Americans in this country who are smart and informed enough to recognize the difference between meaningful attempts to hold elected officials accountable and meaningless attempts.\n\nWhen the Republicans impeached Bill Clinton in 1998, it was widely seen as trivial, irrational and unnecessary. In 2019 and 2021, when the Democrats impeached Donald Trump, it was widely seen as serious, just and necessary.\n\nThe consequence for each was in keeping with the spirit of each.\n\nFor the Republicans, a meaningless impeachment yielded poor outcomes. In the 1998 midterms, they failed to win as many House seats as they expected. For the Democrats, meaningful impeachments yielded good outcomes. Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in 2020. In the 2022 midterms, the Republicans once again failed to win as many House seats as they expected. (The Senate did not change in 1998, but in 2022, the Democrats held their ground to gain one.)\n\nThis is important to point out. Trump's campaign for president has become a vengeance movement . It aims explicitly to win back power to pay back everyone who's wronged him. And it has two fronts: the campaign trail and the US House of Representatives. Republicans there have been working hard to make meaningful attempts to hold Trump accountable seem meaningless.\n\nThere are, however, enough Americans in this country who are smart and informed enough to recognize the difference between meaningful attempts to hold elected officials accountable and meaningless attempts. They know, but more important is that Trump and the Republicans know that they know.\n\nYet can't stop.\n\nWe saw initial steps last week in this process of making accountability seem meaningless. The House voted, along party lines, to censure California Congressman Adam Schiff for leading Trump's first impeachment trial.\n\nIn short order, we saw inklings of future steps.\n\nNone of these has amounted to anything and may never. If they do, however, they will be seen widely as trivial, irrational and unnecessary - as meaningless as the impeachment of Bill Clinton over the fact that he lied to a grand jury.\n\nBiden has done nothing remotely impeachable. \"Expungement\" is a fantasy. The GOP is transparent in trying to punish Garland for Special Counsel Jack Smith's indictment of Trump for mishandling (stealing) government secrets.\n\nNone of these meets, or will ever meet, the constitutional standard of high crimes and misdemeanors, as the impeachment trials of Donald Trump did. He extorted a foreign ally with the intent of defrauding the American people. Then he led an attempted paramilitary takeover of the United States government.\n\nPunishing Clinton for lying about sex was not meaningful.\n\nPunishing Trump for treason was meaningful.\n\nAgain, it bears repeating that there are enough people in this country who are smart and informed enough to recognize the difference between meaningful attempts to hold elected officials accountable and meaningless attempts.\n\nIt bears repeating that Trump and the Republicans know that they know this.\n\nYet can't stop.\n\nThey can't stop because the widespread view that his impeachments were serious, just and necessary stands in his way. They must make attempts to hold Trump accountable seem trivial, irrational and unnecessary. Just one problem.\n\nNo one will believe them.\n\nAfter all, if Trump's impeachments were as trivial, irrational and unnecessary as Trump and the Republicans say they were, why are they working hard to make meaningful attempts to hold Trump accountable seem meaningless?\n\nOn Wednesday, the House Republicans censured California Congressman Adam Schiff, because he advanced \"allegations that Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia,\" according to the Post .\n\nThe resolution's text, passed along party lines, accuses Schiff of abusing his power as head of the House Intelligence Committee during Trump's term, of spreading \"false accusations that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia,\" and of behaving \"dishonestly and dishonorably on many other occasions.\"\n\nYou can see what's going on here. The House Republicans are taking the first step in a series of (what I suspect are) intended steps toward doing something, - anything - that would satisfy the party's desire for revenge. They seem bent on impeaching Joe Biden, but have started with Schiff's censure. I think that the goal over time is bankrupting hope of holding Republicans accountable.\n\nBut with choices come consequences.\n\nLots of Americans are smart enough to understand the difference between meaningless and meaningful censures as well as meaningless and meaningful impeachments. And while the House Republicans seem to be proud of themselves for forcing such a breathtakingly cynical vote against Trump's nemesis, they are actually making the job of being a Democrat that much easier.\n\nIt would be better if the information on which the House Republicans based their decisions was good. But it comes from the rightwing media apparatus, which is global in scale, and which bends toward totalizing groupthink. So their information is generally upside down, backwards and prolapsed .\n\nCase in point is the first provision of the House resolution censuring Schiff: \"Whereas the allegation that President Donald Trump colluded with Russia to interfere in the 2016 Presidential election has been revealed as false by numerous in-depth investigations, including the recent report by Special Counsel John Durham, which documents how the conspiracy theory was invented, funded, and spread by President's Trump's political rivals.\"\n\nActually, Trump did collude. \"Numerous in-depth investigations\" did not disprove that fact, not even John Durham's. To be sure, Durham tried to discredit two major investigations, one into Russia's sabotage of the 2016 election and the other into the FBI's investigation of Russia's sabotage of the 2016 election. But at every point, John Durham failed to deliver. Moreover, he confirmed his failure on the day that the House Republicans censured Schiff.\n\nDuring testimony yesterday, wrote historian Heather Cox Richardson, the \"Democrats on the committee pressed Durham on the facts of the Russia investigation itself, and he, seemingly somewhat reluctantly, agreed under oath in response to questions by Representative Adam Schiff that the facts of the Mueller report and the Senate Intelligence Committee report were correct:\n\n\"Russia interfered in the 2016 election for the benefit of Trump, Trump's campaign welcomed the help and shared information and secret meetings with Russian operatives, and the FBI was justified in investigating that interference.\"\n\nIt's a world that's upside down, backwards and prolapsed.\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that democracy is in trouble when one of the parties devolves into an upside-down-backwards-and-prolapsed world. But the conventional wisdom forgets something - that as one party devolves into lies, delusion and petty paybacks, the other's job gets that much easier.\n\nRemember, the House Republicans are not making arguments. They are lying. They are not interpreting ambiguities. They are lying. They are not spinning facts to put themselves in the most favorable light. They are lying so much that when they think they've thrown a hard inside pitch to jam Schiff, they've actually thrown a dinner-plate-sized pitch down the middle, and Schiff destroyed it.\n\n\"Why are you not standing beside me, the subject of a similar rebuke for speaking the truth?\" he said in response to censure. \"Why did you not stand up to Donald Trump, why did you not reject his immorality, why did you not condemn his dishonesty, why did you not speak out when his horde attacked this Capitol, when he treats the nation's secrets with such carelessness, lawlessness and disdain, why did you hide from efforts to hold him accountable, why were you silent, afraid, unwilling to do your ethical, constitutional duty, why did you cower, why did you cower - and why do you still?\"\n\nThe closer they are to Trump, the easier the job of being a Democrat.\n\nDon't take my word for it. Ask Matt Gaetz. During the hearing, the Florida congressman, who may be closest to Donald Trump, said to John Durham that \"when you are part of the cover-up, Mr. Durham, you make our jobs harder.\"\n\nAs far as I can tell, Tuesday's arraignment of a criminal former president is being taken as proof of the American credo - that no one is above the law. Forgive me for my repeating myself. His arraignment proves no such thing.\n\nIt is proof of something, though - that justice is the product of democratic politics. His prosecution is politically motivated. And thank God for that.\n\n\" No one is above the law \" is and will be propaganda, not fact. If it were fact, we would never see a billionaire, because in order to become a billionaire, the government must look away while the billionaire does what he needs to do to become a billionaire. Impunity is baked into the American credo. It's baked into the American dream, too. Billionaires embody the very definition of success.\n\nRobert Kuttner put it this way in a review of Trevor Jackson's Impunity and Capitalism : \"While in office, [Donald] Trump abused his pardon privilege to excuse dozens of corrupt, convicted allies, and he would likely do so again if reelected. We live in an age of selective application of law, in which influential people often evade responsibility for actions that are or should be criminal, while minor offenders such as shoplifters or drug users can face prison terms. Trump made crudely personal what has become tacit and structural \" (my stress).\n\nSo even if Trump is convicted of the charges against him, his conviction won't prove that \"no one is above the law.\" As Professor Jackson wrote, billionaires will continue to squeeze consumers, communities and markets with a degree of impunity that has become necessary for our variety of capitalism to exist.\n\nI'll believe no one is above the law when, after the next financial panic, those responsible for the vanishment of life, liberty and happiness are perp-walked toward justice. Until then, I think we can expect crimes that only billionaires can commit to continue being treated as \" everyone's fault and no one's .\"\n\nBy continuing to believe, uncritically, that \"no one is above the law,\" we actually enable impunity of the law by the very obscenely rich . \"No one is above the law\" asks Americans to believe that justice is something that just happens, independent of human agency, as if it were a weather system, all-natural, an outcome of God's will. Like financial crimes that are treated as \"everyone's fault and no one's,\" justice is treated as everyone's responsibility and no one's. Is it any wonder, really, that corruption has become so normal as to be invisible?\n\nInvisible, of course, until someone goes too far. At some point, impunity for the law exceeds established levels of tolerance for it, as when a criminal former president led an attempted paramilitary takeover of the United States government. His corruption may well have been forgiven, or at least forgotten, but the most blatant political crime in US history has prevented that. It made every one of his corrupt acts seem like an intolerable assault on democracy.\n\nThat there is such a thing as \"going too far\" is proof that \"no one is above the law\" is propaganda, not fact. Once we accept it as such, we can see what's going on. The deep and broad and democratic demand for Donald Trump to be held criminally accountable is not the consequence of a mindless abstraction that automatically brings wrongdoers to justice. It is the product of pressure applied to law enforcement - the political pressure of democratic politics .\n\nThat political pressure has given lead prosecutors in Manhattan, Georgia and Washington the freedom they need to pursue their respective criminal cases. Trump's prosecution is indeed politically motivated. And thank God for that.\n\nIf there's any doubt about this being a politically motivated prosecution - if there's any doubt about it being the consequence of a deep and broad and democratic demand for it - consider it's unlikely that Trump doubts it.\n\nHe can't meet a political demand for justice with law. The evidence is too strong. (I'm deferring here to legal experts who know what they are talking about.) He must meet a political demand for justice with politics. That means running for president. Only the power of the presidency can save him now.\n\nWe already knew that the deal struck between the president and the House Republicans, to lift the debt ceiling, was going to place new work requirements on childless adults between the ages of 50 and 54 in return for food stamps.\n\nWhat we didn't know is that the legislation changes \"work requirements under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which provides cash assistance to households with children. Under the provisions in the bill, states will likely have to require more parents on TANF to work or be in job training,\" according to Kery Murakami, a senior reporter for Route Fifty , a news site.\n\nMurakami has the details. They are granular and patchwork. Some states would be free to do more to help needy families. Other states would be free to do less. Either way, one official said, the new requirements don't \"leave a lot of time to be parents. We want them to be able to be parents. We want them to be able to solve the crisis that has brought them in our doors in the first place.\"\n\nAccording to David Dayen, editor of The American Prospect , food stamps and TANF \"became a Republican red line. Both of these programs already have work requirements; they're being made stricter. For TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or welfare), they appear to be somewhat optional for the states, which means red states will tighten their eligibility.\"\n\nDuring debt-ceiling talks, TANF did not get the press that food stamps got. This is due to those who get help with groceries being in a much larger group than those who get help at state-poverty levels. Some say the deal avoided the severest outcomes. Work requirements on food stamps affect only childless adults. But TANF changes affect plenty of kids. From a broad point of view, things could have been worse. From a particular point of view, they are worse.\n\nSo we should remember what Hakeem Jeffries said . During debt-ceiling talks, when word got out that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was bent on forcing the hungry to work, the House minority leader reportedly told a Democratic Party leadership committee that work requirements were a \" nonstarter .\"\n\nI understand the need for flexibility during negotiations, especially with illiberals who can't stop won't stop hating poor people for the fact of their poverty. But evidently work requirements were not a nonstarter. Under Jeffries' leadership, more Democrats than Republicans voted for the deal.\n\nThe problem, I think, was taking McCarthy's words at face value. He, like other illiberals, said that forcing the poor to work lifts them out of poverty. Liberals were right to say he was wrong. Denying them aid deepens their misery. But one side saying it \"works\" and the other saying it doesn't work as intended is variation of gridlock. Remember that gridlock favors rightwing politics .\n\nDebating whether a particular policy does or doesn't work is a losing debate in the face of illiberals who can't stop won't stop hating poor people for the fact of their poverty. Instead of debating illiberals as if they were prepared to stand by their own arguments (they are not), liberals should be alleging - that denying help to the needy is tantamount to punishing them for suffering.\n\nPoverty is not a crime. Let's stop acting like it is.\n\nLet's also stop acting like it's a problem no one can solve.\n\nIt's only unsolvable when debating for and against an anti-poverty policy takes place in a context in which illiberals can't stop won't stop hating poor people for their poverty. To get to the details of any policy idea, and to open a space in which debating its merits is possible, the illiberals must be marginalized, or at least chastened. Debating the merits of a policy won't do that. Accusing illiberals of wanting to punish those who suffer for their suffering might.\n\nNo one chooses to suffer. Illiberals disagree.\n\nThey believe with all their hearts in the existence of the mythical Lazy Do-Nothing. They believe he's out there, somewhere, lazing about, getting something, doing nothing. They believe that work requirements are benevolent and socially constructive. They said they punish laziness and reward work.\n\nBut the only way for that proposition to be true - that poor people choose their poverty as well as their suffering - is for you to have an opinion about poor people that's so monstrous that they are scarcely human beings at all. In other words, for the proposition to be true - that poor people choose their poverty - you must already hate poor people for the fact of their poverty.\n\nThe problem isn't whether this or that anti-poverty policy does or doesn't work. The problem is hating the poor. The problem is punishing them for suffering. They are already suffering. Now they will suffer twice as much.\n\nWe should thank Jerry Cirino. It's not every day that a Republican says the quiet part out loud - that when it comes to free speech, the point is not liberty for all, but liberty for some Republicans to say what they want, to force the rest of us to listen and, critically, to prevent the rest of us from talking back.\n\nThe Ohio state senator spoke after the Ohio Senate passed legislation last week that, according to the Ohio Capital Journal , \"focuses on what Republicans call 'free speech,' banning public universities in Ohio from having 'bias' in the classroom and limiting what 'controversial topics' can and can't be taught.\"\n\nThe goal, reportedly, is creating \"safe spaces\" for \"conservatives\" on campus.\n\nCirino, who sponsored the bill, said it frees people \"from the pressure to agree with a single ideological perspective, which dominates our campuses today.\"\n\nCirino shouldn't have said that.\n\nHe should have said what a fellow Republican said.\n\nState Representative Josh Williams told local TV reporters that he believes that \"conservatives feel discriminated against on campus.\" He cited his experience at the University of Toledo's law school. \"If you had an opposing view, you would just call that individual a fascist, a Nazi, as a way of quashing their speech and making their comments and their positions irrelevant,\" he said.\n\nWe're used to hearing about discrimination, but Cirino didn't do that.\n\nInstead, Cirino said that Senate 83 would, if enacted into state law, liberate \"conservatives\" from \"the pressure to agree\" with - well, it doesn't matter.\n\nWhat matters is that conservatives feel pressured. What matters is that this feeling, to these conservatives, constitutes an infringement on their rights and liberties. What matters is that these infringements demand action, even though such action will infringe someone's rights and liberties. Free speech for everyone isn't the point. The point is ensuring that conservatives feel free. Let's step back for a minute to say that in every context in which human beings agree to organize themselves, there's a prevailing way of thinking about the world that influences how those involved operate. This is true in public and private. This is true in families. This is true in businesses. This is true in governments. Everywhere is some kind of \"single ideological perspective.\"\n\nWe usually don't call it that, however. We don't call it anything, because the status quo (or consensus), while it influences our choices, is invisible. It's invisible, because most people most of the time, in a context in which human beings agree to organize themselves, generally accept it for what it is.\n\nUntil they don't.\n\nEvery context has a \"single ideological perspective.\" But rarely, if ever, is the status quo (or consensus) so dominant that it silences, by force of law, the views of individuals who generally accept it for what it is. Everyone's got an opinion. They are not policed, with rare exception. Does that mean everyone is free to say whatever they want whenever they want free of consequences?\n\nC'mon.\n\nContrary to what Republican lawmakers want us to believe, conservative thinking is very much present on university campuses. Conservative thinking (however it's defined) is among a host of ways of thinking about the world.\n\nContrary to what Republican lawmakers want us to believe, universities are marketplaces where participants persuade each other that a way of thinking about the world is the right way (even if that way of thinking about the world concedes that all, or most, ways of thinking about the world are meritorious).\n\nPersuasion on university campuses is the status quo (or consensus). Persuasion is the \"single ideological perspective\" that makes conservatives uncomfortable.\n\nIt makes them uncomfortable, because persuasion is pressure - a democratic pressure - that demands that we open our minds. Conservatives don't want pressure. They want to be told they're right. If they aren't, they can't feel free.\n\nOhio Senate Bill 83 doesn't create \"safe spaces\" in which conservatives can feel safe from discrimination, though that's what they want us to believe.\n\nIt creates spaces in which conservatives can feel safe from the pressure of being persuaded to open their minds - safe from doubt about what they believe to be true. As persuasion is democratic, the legislation does something else for conservatives. It protects them from the pressures of democracy.\n\nDemocracy isn't safe.\n\nThat might not have been clear before Jerry Cirino said as much.\n\nThanks, Jerry.\n\nUS Senator Dianne Feinstein developed a heretofore undisclosed case of brain shingles and ghosted leading Democrats who reached out to her during her extended recovery in California, the Times reported Wednesday .\n\nFeinstein's failure to disclose the full extent of her illness is a profound breach of trust. It makes you wonder what else she's hiding even from the leaders of her own party. Feinstein's decline is taking place against a background of unrestrained ego, bare-knuckle politics and fake appeals to feminism.\n\nWe've long known the 89-year-old was suffering from shingles, but the Times was the first to report that the virus spread to her brain. Most people associate shingles with nerve pain, which can be excruciating, but which doesn't impair a person mentally. However, according to two sources familiar with Feinstein's diagnosis, the senator developed a rare complication known as encephalitis, a cerebral inflammation that can result in long-term deficits in speech, memory, mood, and movement, especially in the elderly. Feinstein returned to Washington a shadow of her former self, with some observers describing her physical decline as \"frightening.\"\n\nDuring her convalescence, Feinstein reportedly never returned a call from California Governor Gavin Newsom and flatly refused a visit from her fellow senator from California, Alex Padilla.\n\nThese revelations come on the heels of a troubling exchange with reporters from Slate and the LA Times , in which the 89-year-old senator seemed unaware that she'd been absent from Washington for months.\n\n\"I haven't been gone,\" Feinstein said, when the Slate reporter asked her about her colleagues welcoming her back to Washington, \"You should ... I haven't been gone. I've been working.\"\n\nFeinstein's aides conceded to the Times that the senator has missed several votes since she's been back and that she's currently operating on a lighter than usual schedule. She missed a meeting of the powerful appropriations committee Tuesday. Even before her recent absence, Feinstein's staff reportedly devised a call system to make sure their boss wasn't allowed to wander around the Capitol. They feared she might encounter reporters. This was a problem because \"over the last several years, interviews with Feinstein devolved into confusion on a near-daily basis.\" It was easier to keep her under surveillance than walk back the off-the-wall things she said to the press.\n\nAs if this charade weren't pathetic enough, Politico reported Tuesday that Nancy Pelosi's oldest daughter , Nancy Prowda, is the point person on the Feinstein Dementia Mitigation Team. Pelosi has a political interest in propping up Feinstein until she completes her term in two years' time. The former House majority leader has tried to invoke feminism to defend her longtime friend, claiming that decrepit male senators don't get as much flack as Feinstein has gotten. A claim that, even if it were true, is not a ringing endorsement of Feinstein's capacities.\n\nPelosi's motives go beyond sisterhood. Feinstein's successor will be named by Gov. Newsom. Newsom has pledged to replace Feinstein with a Black woman, but Pelosi wants to see the Senate seat go to her protegé, California Congressman Adam Schiff, who meets neither of Newsom's stated criteria. The goal, according to Politico 's sources, is to keep Feinstein in office as long as possible, so as to deny or diminish the advantage of incumbency to whoever Newsom might choose.\n\nFeinstein's mental acumen has been an issue for years. In 2020, Feinstein asked then-CEO Jack Dorsey whether Twitter was doing enough to stem the tide of disinformation. This was a great question, except that Feinstein seemed unaware that she'd asked Dorsey the same thing a few seconds ago.\n\nSome Democrats urged Feinstein to retire after she hugged Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and praised the Amy Coney Barrett Supreme Court confirmation hearings as some of the best she'd ever seen.\n\nThe Senate Republicans had been racing to confirm Coney Barrett before the election in a blatant partisan power grab, after sanctimoniously denying Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee a hearing on the grounds that it was an election year. Feinstein's effusive praise embarrassed her colleagues and allies and undercut weeks of messaging.\n\nDianne Feinstein blazed a trail for women in politics, but her refusal to retire is putting her legacy at risk. Denying the realities of aging and death serves no one, certainly not the cause of feminism. Neither the senator nor the people of California are well-served by this grotesque spectacle.\n\nThe former leader of the Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, was convicted alongside three of his lieutenants last week of seditious conspiracy and a slew of other offenses.\n\nThe jury concluded that the Proud Boys, a notorious fighting/drinking club calling itself \"Trump's Army,\" plotted to obstruct the joint session of Congress on January 6. They sought to halt the certification of Joe Biden's electoral college victory and reinstall Donald Trump as president.\n\nSo far, over a dozen high-level Proud Boys and Oath Keepers have been convicted or plead guilty to charges of seditious conspiracy for their roles on J6. Seditious conspiracy is the most serious of all charges stemming from the J6 insurrection and as well as the hardest to prove. These verdicts are a major victory for the Justice Department, but they also increase the pressure on special prosecutor Jack Smith to charge the conspirator in chief, Donald Trump.\n\nEnrique Tarrio's defense at trial was that he was just following orders from Trump.\n\n\"It was Donald Trump's words. It was his motivation. It was his anger that caused what occurred on January 6th in your beautiful and amazing city,\" Tarrio's lawyer said in his closing statement, \"It was not Enrique Tarrio. They want to use Enrique Tarrio as a scapegoat for Donald J. Trump and those in power.\"\n\nTarrio was no mere scapegoat, but that lawyer has a point. Donald Trump was the unindicted co-conspirator in that courtroom.\n\nWe already know a lot about how Trump gathered his supporters in Washington, wound them up with a conspiracy theory-laden tirade, and pointed them in the direction of the Capitol.\n\nEnticing the faithful to DC was a drawn-out process. Trump put the Proud Boys on notice in 2020 when he told the drinking/brawling society to \"stand back and stand by\" for violence connected to the election.\n\nThen Trump summoned his supporters to Washington for what he called a \"wild protest\" on January 6. Having assembled the crowd at the Ellipse on the appointed day, Trump riled up the crowd with fanciful tales of election fraud and set them loose on the joint session of Congress, which had convened to certify Joe Biden's electoral victory.\n\nCassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, fleshed out many key details in her testimony before the January 6 committee.\n\nHutchinson explained that Trump not only set the mob on the Capitol, he intended to lead them himself. The former president knew what was going to happen: The mob was going to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power and he wanted to lead them.\n\nNot only that, Trump knew that many in the crowd were carrying guns. In the run up to J6, Hutchinson remembered hearing the words \"Proud Boys\" and \"Oath Keepers\" being bandied about. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows also spoke with dirty trickster Roger Stone and QAnon luminary Michael Flynn on January 5 \"regarding what would play out the next day.\"\n\nThe Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers have ties to Stone, Trump's oldest political confidante. He gave the Proud Boys a national profile during Trump's presidency. The Proud Boys served as his personal guard and his social media consultants. At one point, the Proud Boys were so close to Stone they controlled his phone and posted to social media on his behalf.\n\nTarrio and the other Proud Boys richly deserve the lengthy prison sentences they're probably going to face at their sentencing later this month.\n\nDonald Trump, the man who orchestrated the insurrection, should face the same fate.\n\nThe more Republican candidates running for their party's nomination raise the issue of Joe Biden's age (80), the more the president's allies, among the Democrats and normal Democratic voters, are likely to defend him, almost certainly with some kind of warm pap about age being only a state of mind.\n\nAge is not only a state of mind.\n\nNot in reality, especially not in a job that rapidly accelerates the aging process. George W. Bush looked young when he began. He looked old when he was done. Ditto for Barack Obama. With a huge head start, Biden's oldness is getting faster daily. (Donald Trump may have escaped such consequences. After all, he never bothered to take leadership seriously.)\n\nWhen Nikki Haley, former ambassador to the United Nations under Trump, who is running for the GOP's nomination against her former boss, said we'd likely see the current president die in five years, there could be heard a giant sucking gasping sound followed by a deafening clutching of pearls. Let's not kid ourselves. Everyone shuffles off this mortal coil. Death, being humanity's common denominator, is no reason not to vote for Joe Biden.\n\nFortunately, Haley agrees.\n\nJust ask her.\n\nHaley was not, as headlines variously reported, going \"after Biden's age.\" She did not \"mock\" his age. She did not take a \"swipe\" at his age. Biden's age was secondary to Haley's principal objective, which was reminding audiences that in the event of the old man's death, his second-in-charge takes over.\n\nIn this case, a 58-year-old biracial woman.\n\n\"He announced that he's running again in 2024,\" Haley told Fox . \"I think that we can all be very clear and say with a matter of fact that if you vote for Joe Biden you really are counting on a President Harris, because the idea that he would make it until 86 years old is not something that I think is likely.\"\n\nWanting to defend Biden is understandable. So is wanting to defend his elderliness. But age isn't relevant to his opponents. What's relevant is Kamala Harris's race and sex. Let's not help by taking their words seriously. Let's embrace the moment's complexity. Anyway, we don't have a choice.\n\nThe president is running for reelection. He will be the Democratic Partys' nominee. (Pay no attention to marginal alternatives. They are marginal for a reason.) Trump is running, too. He will almost certainly be the Republican Party's nominee. (Haley knows she has a snowball's chance.) So far, 2024 is already set as a repeat of 2020. In any other context, Biden's age totally matters. In this context, nah. He's the best and, therefore, only choice.\n\nBut with a different context comes a different set of problems - and this is where Haley's comments come to the fore. Right now, the president's allies are all about defending him. They should. But old men die at inconvenient moments. We should think about that. This isn't a reason not to vote for him. It's a reason to prepare for what's to come in case he dies in office.\n\nIf Biden dies in office, Harris will become the first woman president. She will become the first biracial woman president. She will become something no one has become. In the history of American politics, that outcome will be second only to Barack Obama's 2008 victory, second only because she would not have been elected. Time would tell whether the white-power backlash against a President Harris would be as strong as the one against the first Black president. But let's be clear: Given what we know about American politics, there's no question there will be a white-power reaction.\n\nAlong with a white-power reaction will be, almost certainly, a white-liberal reaction. I say \"almost certainly\" because we saw a two-tiered outcome after 2008. While the racists and revanchists dug in, turning away from democracy and toward political violence, white liberals pat themselves on the back for establishing a foundation for a real \"post-racial America.\"\n\n\"Post-racial America\" was a lovely bit of liberal propaganda. Yes, it was embraced, encouraged and advanced by the Obama administration, but that's what it was. The only thing real about it was the way of made white liberals feel. While they were feeling good, they lost focus on a GOP that was turning away from democracy. By 2016, many Americans, not just white liberals, believed voting for Donald Trump couldn't possibly be that bad.\n\nI don't believe history repeats itself. I don't think it rhymes either. I think conditions change, and with them come new problems. But we'd be fools not to consider what might happen if Joe Biden died in office and Kamala Harris became something no one in this country's history has ever been. We'd also be fools for thinking we can avoid this possibility. Death comes for us. It's no reason not to vote for Biden. Anyway, we don't have a choice.\n\nSince about 2016, a sort of cottage industry has emerged to soothe the nerves of respectable white people, telling them that they're sooooo right. Democracy may be backsliding into a pit of autocratic despair, but that's not because America is bad. America is a beacon of hope around the world!\n\nSpringing from this tenor of thought, as I see it, are missives of the kind I read recently in The Atlantic , in which the writer, who should know better, pretends that he does not know better before claiming that \"red states\" controlled by the Republican Party have become \"laboratories of autocracy.\"\n\nThis is how Brian Klaas, a political scientist at the London School of Economics, began his latest: \"In 1932, Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis applauded the role of experimentation within the states, calling them 'laboratories of democracy' that could inspire reforms at the national level.\"\n\n\"Today,\" wrote the author of The Despot's Accomplice: How the West is Aiding and Abetting the Decline of Democracy, \"that dynamic is inverted, as some red states have become laboratories of autocracy, experimenting with the autocratic playbook in ways that could filter up to the federal government. American states are now splintering, not just on partisan lines, but on their commitment to the principles of liberal democracy.\"\n\nIt's not that he's wrong. Red states are experimenting with authoritarianism. Klaas demonstrates this fact by citing numerous examples - from the policing of \"abortion traffickers\" in Montana to extreme gerrymandering in North Carolina, from voter suppression tactics in Georgia to expelling Democratic reformers, who'd raised hell, from Tennessee state House.\n\nNo one should deny these things are happening, but neither should anyone see them as a result of \"red states\" becoming laboratories of autocracy. As for their \"splintering ... on their commitment to the principles of liberal democracy\"? This America is an America that has never existed. The view here is from 30,000 feet in the air. It's better to be closer to the ground.\n\nThe ex-slaver states of the former Confederate States of America, and the regions of the country that have aligned with them, have always been autocratic. They will almost certainly always be autocratic. The question isn't whether they are. The question is how they express themselves. The key, for the real \"laboratories of democracy\" and hence for America's global image as a beacon of hope, is whether such expressions can be contained.\n\nIt was largely contained by the last quarter of the last century, but not before then. This may come as a shock, because we tend to take the Bill of Rights for granted, but there was a time in our history when the Bill of Rights applied only to the federal government. It did not apply to the states .\n\nUnder ideal conditions, and there were and are ways of manufacturing ideal conditions, a state could and did crush civil rights and individual liberties. If a state wanted to outlaw sodomy, it did. If it wanted to regulate forms of worship, it did. If it wanted to prevent undesirables from voting, it did.\n\nThere were ways of pushing back, of complicating those \"ideal conditions,\" but they did not include torts against state governments for violating constitutional rights, because such appeals had not yet been recognized.\n\nThe federal government accelerated its containment (my word) of these autocratic laboratories only after the US Supreme Court, in the late 1930s, accelerated a process known to legal scholars as \"selective incorporation.\"\n\nIn plain English, that's the process of reading the Bill of Rights through the lens of the 14th Amendment's due process clause, in effect nationalizing them, so they applied to the states as well as the federal government.\n\nSome rights were never incorporated and probably never will be on account of the current Supreme Court, and its rightwing supermajority, reversing this long orientation toward nationalizing the the Bill of Rights.\n\nI'm no legal scholar, but that reversal seems to have become transparent with the overturning of Roe , thus triggering the invalidation of not only the national right to abortion but the national right against the infringement of privacy by state governments. With those rights now gone at the national level, states are free to return to their natural states of authoritarianism.\n\nRepublican legislators are now passing laws providing government agents the potential for accessing virtually anything, privacy be damned. Kansas recently enacted a statute paving the way for grotesque intrusions. It requires the inspection of genitals to block \"men\" (trans women) from competing in the \"wrong\" sport (and from using the \"wrong\" bathroom).\n\nThese experiments are being projected beyond their borders. \"Many red states have already considered bills to restrict travel for abortion care,\" wrote Lindsay Beyerstein . \"Last year, an antiabortion legislator in Missouri tried to criminalize aiding and abetting an abortion outside the state.\"\n\nThis is why \"contained\" is the right word. Just as the US government tried to \"contain\" the spread of Soviet Communism around the world, during the post-World War II era, so too must real \"laboratories of democracy\" try to contain the spread of native autocracy. (Let's hope for better success.)\n\nAgain, Klaas isn't wrong. It's obvious. Some state governments dominated by the Republicans are experimenting with authoritarianism. But what they are experimenting with is not a matter of kind. They were always already authoritarian. What they are experimenting with is a matter of degree.\n\nHow much autocracy are they willing to express? In the last quarter of the last century, when the Supreme Court's rulings effectively contained authoritarianism, the ex-slaver states of the former Confederate States of America, and the regions that aligned with them, expressed less of it.\n\nBut now that a rightwing supermajority has begun reversing a century of \"selective incorporation,\" we are seeing these states and allies expressing violent spasms of autocracy, as if supported by the court, which they are.\n\nI don't have a problem with respectable white people clinging to the idea of America being a beacon of hope around the world. But let's concede to the hard reality of that belief. We are not a united country. Parts of us don't believe in liberty. Parts of us are compelled to make some of us suffer.\n\nTo the extent that we are a beacon, and I think we are, it's because the real \"laboratories of democracy\" - the ex-free labor states, say - believe that governments ought to maximize opportunity and minimize suffering.\n\nThe first thing to understand about legislation passed Wednesday by the House Republicans, which lifts the debt ceiling for a year, is that it's not serious. The second thing is that we know it's not, by reading about it.\n\nWe don't need special \"insider\" access. We don't need a crystal ball. No, this is not some sort of Svengalian victory for the Republican Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy. Anyone can understand this by their ability to read.\n\nAccording to the Post , the bill would raise the borrowing cap but repeal Joe Biden's \"recent accomplishments, including a bevy of tax credits meant to spur the adoption of electric vehicles and other clean technologies.\"\n\nWith the bill, the House Republicans aim to \"end the president's plan to waive up to $10,000 from millions of borrowers' student debts. It limits the power of federal agencies to issue regulations on a wide array of industries. And it imposes a raft of new rules on low-income families that receive federal benefits, including food stamps and Medicaid, requiring them to work longer hours in exchange for help - or risk losing aid entirely.\"\n\nThese are just a sampling. There's more .\n\nUntil now, the main focus has been on the House Republicans and their willingness to play chicken with the fate of the world. If the US defaulted on its debt, we'd see tens of trillions of dollars in personal wealth go pffth .\n\nNaturally, the possibility of apocalypse has seized our attention since that moment in January when the GOP (just barely) took control of the House of Representatives. But now that they've produced a document, rather than continue talking about producing one, it's clear we never had to go that far.\n\nThink about it this way.\n\nEven if you hate pretty much everything about this president and his liberal legislative agenda, you can't expect him to say, in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, \"Dude! I'll totally trash all of my era-defining achievements on which I'm going to base my 2024 reelection campaign. Yuh, bruh! Yuh!\" It's one thing to hate pretty much everything about this president and his liberal legislative agenda. It's another to think he's an idiot. He's not.\n\nThis is where things should end. They won't, though, because there's a push underway that will result in the House GOP seeming serious. Some of that push involves bad-faith actors making Joe Biden responsible for their choices. Some of it involves good-faith efforts by the press and pundit corps to contextualize the debate over debts and deficits. Because that debate is serious, the impression left will be of a serious House GOP.\n\nBut asking Biden to throw away his accomplishments isn't the only sign of unseriousness. Consider the House Republicans' bargaining position.\n\nTo get what they want, they have to persuade the other side to say yes. Normally, when one side needs a yes, it offers the other side something to say yes to. I'm not sure what that might be in this case, but it's definitely not asking a president to shitcan two years of era-defining achievement.\n\nWhen you do not offer something the other side can say yes to, you have given them a road to no. If you have given them a road to no, you don't really know what \"bargaining\" means. If you don't know what \"bargaining\" means, you have no business at the bargaining table. You're not serious.\n\nTo be sure, the president wants the House Republicans to lift the debt ceiling, but that's not the same as offering him something to say yes to.\n\nHanging over the bargaining table are the consequences of failing to agree, namely, the question of fault. The president has said yes, unconditionally, to raising the debt ceiling. He's waiting for the House Republicans to come around. Meanwhile, they've larded a counteroffer with conditions - in effect, poison pills . There's nowhere else for the consequences to fall.\n\nThe Republicans have no leverage. All they can do is pretend otherwise.\n\nAnd betray their unseriousness - again.\n\nNone of this is to say that the Republicans are not playing a dangerous game. They are playing a dangerous game . But as Noah Berlatsky has repeatedly pointed out , they don't have the incentive to be serious.\n\nGerrymandering and structural advantages, Noah has said , mean they have \"less accountability to voters, which means they have trouble gauging what's popular and what's not popular, even with their own constituents.\"\n\nThey don't have a reason to offer something to say yes to, but they do have a reason to offer something to say no to. We should pay attention to this feature of our politics - the perverse incentives created by a system giving advantage to the most unserious people among us as well as disadvantage to the most serious people among us. The patients are running the asylum.\n\nWe, too, are pretending otherwise.\n\nLiberal democracy suffers typically when controversies are left to the eye of the beholder. Consider a new debate over old laws governing child labor.\n\nOn the one hand are the Republicans and business allies in nearly a dozen states who are moving to \"loosen child labor laws to help employers fill empty jobs,\" according to a report in USA Today . These advocates say \"relaxing the rules will prompt more teens to seek out valuable work experiences and make it easier to supplement their families incomes.\"\n\nOn the other hand, according to the same report, are those who say \"minors who work in manufacturing, meatpacking and construction jobs are being exploited or hurt.\" It went on to say these bills \"are an attempt to roll back crucial child labor protections that are nearly a century old.\"\n\nWe're talking about child labor laws, so naturally the focus is on what's good for teens in workplace settings. But that leaves it to the eye of the beholder. Republicans say \"relaxing the rules\" is good for them. Critics say it's not. In that framing, it's up to teens and parents. But the reality of things is this:\n\nChild labor laws, like all labor laws, affect everyone who participates in the economy. Since everyone participates, child labor laws affect everyone. If we don't put this fact at the center of the debate, liberal democracy suffers.\n\nBefore I go on, set aside emotional appeals by critics of \"relaxed\" child labor laws. Their goal is eliciting sympathy for kids on the strength of America's past (and terrible) exploitation of them. \"Do you remember the images of children in manufacturing and other dangerous work conditions from the early 1900s?\" a critic said, per USA Today . \"There is a reason our society said that it is not appropriate for children to work in those conditions.\"\n\nThe problem with these appeals is that they try to elicit sympathy for kids who don't work in horrific working conditions that don't exist currently. Look, I agree. Give these Republicans an inch. They'll take a mile. But as long as horrific working conditions don't exist currently, and they don't, not yet, the Republicans can do what they always do best: deny, deny, deny.\n\nBetter to say what they're doing, not what they haven't done.\n\nThey aren't just trying to loosen up labor laws.\n\nThey're also trying to loosen up the labor market.\n\nRemember, it's tight . Unemployment hasn't been this low since the late 1960s. Firms can't find enough workers, not because there aren't enough workers willing to work. It's because firms, in aggregate, refuse to pay more than they used to. Because they refuse to pay more than they used to, in aggregate, many workers can shop their labor around to those who will.\n\nThe result has been rising wages, even as inflation eats into them.\n\nAdding more complexity to a complex situation is the tightening of the US-Mexican border, at the demand of Republican legislators, state and federal, a demand that's been met largely by the current administration, so that immigrants who'd otherwise take low-paying jobs can't get to them.\n\nFirms, in aggregate, keep refusing to budge on pay. Republican legislators, in aggregate, keep refusing to budge on immigration. As long as they stick with the Republicans, there's only one thing businessleaders can do when the usual source of cheap labor is exhausted - replace it with a new source.\n\nOr in this case, an old source - children.\n\nThere should be no doubt that flooding the market with cheap labor will not only lower labor costs in some sectors of the economy but in the whole economy as well. Remember, it's a tight labor market that's been pushing wages higher and faster than they have been in more than half a century.\n\nThere should be no doubt about something else: that lowering the cost of labor by flooding the market with cheap labor is the Republicans' objective. Why should there be no doubt? Because that's what they're telling us.\n\nFor instance, a GOP state senator from Minnesota said that child labor laws \"make it even harder for businesses to find reliable employers.\" So by regulating whether and how kids enter the labor market, child labor laws make it harder to find workers needed for available jobs. Flooding the market with cheap labor is a twofer. Firms can pay kids pennies. Kids accepting pennies means adults elsewhere will accept pennies, too.\n\nThe Republicans tell us their real goal in another way.\n\nBy saying that \"relaxed\" child labor laws would help teens supplement their families' incomes, they're admitting their parents don't make enough. But instead of saying that parents should be paid better wages, thus running at odds with businesspeople, they say teens ought to be paid pennies, too.\n\nAll of this can be made transparent with enough scrutiny. Instead, though, liberal critics howl at the moon about what the Republicans might do some time in the future that might look bad, maybe, but that hasn't happened yet.\n\nWe can do better.\n\nSay this instead.\n\nIt's not only in the interest of teens that child labor laws stay as they have been for the last century. It's in everyone's interest - everyone, anyway, who has labored for a living . If you haven't, well, you know, sit the hell down.\n\nThe eldest member of the rightwing supermajority of the United States Supreme Court - well, let's just say the man keeps telling on himself.\n\nLast week, ProPublica revealed that Justice Clarence Thomas had been palling around for decades with a rightwing billionaire, accepting luxury gifts along the way, including world tours on his superyacht. Yet the man who presides over the law, telling us what the law is, didn't obey the law. Federal ethics statutes require disclosure of gifts of \"anything of value.\"\n\nHe didn't.\n\nBut he does think we're fools.\n\nIn response to ProPublica 's report, Thomas said, in so many words, that he didn't on his own determine what the law is, instead relied on someone else to tell him what the law is, then failed to obey the law based on that other person's misreading of the law, so it wasn't his fault that he failed to obey it.\n\nThen he told on himself. He said, well, he was \"advised\" the law didn't apply given that, you know, Harlan Crow is one of his \" close personal friends .\"\n\nThis is what I zeroed in on last week. I said that if I were a billionaire hoping to influence a Supreme Court justice, I'd want to do it without appearing to be doing it. One of the best ways of influencing without appearing to influence, I said, is by becoming one of the justice's \"close personal friends.\"\n\nThe Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee have begun raising hell in response to ProPublica 's reporting. That's good. The first branch of government should reassert its authority over the third. But, as I said, if the focus is things, the focus is wrong. The \"anything of value\" in this \"close personal relationship\" isn't a thing. It's the \"close personal relationship.\"\n\nI stress this today, because Thomas did.\n\nHe keeps telling on himself.\n\nProPublic reported this week that Crow bought Thomas' childhood home, and surrounding homes, in Pinpoint, Georgia. \"The transaction marks the first known instance of money flowing from the Republican megadonor to the Supreme Court justice,\" the report said. \"The Crow company bought the properties for $133,363 from three co-owners - Thomas, his mother and the family of Thomas' late brother, according to a state tax document and a deed dated Oct. 15, 2014, filed at the Chatham County courthouse.\"\n\nNow, it's very weird for the \"close personal friend\" of a Supreme Court justice to become his elderly mother's landlord. (She still lived in the house at the time of purchase.) But who am I to judge? The money is also small beer - $133,363 is a lot to normal people, but not to a real estate mogul.\n\nThe amount isn't the point. The point is that a justice charged with telling the rest of us what the law is didn't obey it. \"The disclosure form Thomas filed for that year also had a space to report the identity of the buyer in any private transaction, such as a real estate deal. That space is blank.\"\n\nThen Thomas told on himself - again.\n\n\"Harlan and Kathy Crow are among our dearest friends,\" he said in a statement to ProPublica . \"As friends do, we have joined them on a number of family trips.\" Then Crow told on Thomas - the gifts were \"no different from the hospitality we have extended to our many other dear friends.\"\n\nThis is upping the ante.\n\nIn the beginning, when it wasn't clear whether Crow bought influence - they were merely traveling together is all - they were \"close personal friends.\" Now that it's been established that money, though trivial in amount, changed hands, and that this money exchange looks like buying influence, the \"close personal friendship\" has become \"our dearest friends.\"\n\nAt this rate, the Thomases and the Crows will be blood kin next week.\n\nSo far, no one is paying attention to the evolution of this relationship. We should. In this evolution is pretty much everything we need to know about the problem. The best part? Thomas is telling us himself. He's confessing.\n\nHe's confessing four things.\n\nOne, that the problem isn't a thing - an exchange of gifts or money - but a relationship with a very obscenely rich man who can buy what he wants.\n\nTwo, that he may or may not obey the law, it depends, even as he's telling the rest of us what the law is, thus appearing to compromise his jurisprudence and that of the rest of the justices on the Supreme Court.\n\nThree, that his jurisprudence may not be as compromised as it seems.\n\nListen to what he's saying. Listen very carefully. Thomas is saying that he didn't have to obey the law, which requires the disclosure of \"anything of value,\" not in spite of his relationship with a billionaire, but because of it .\n\nIn that, he's telling us that he obeys a law that's higher than the laws of mere democracy, which is the law governing the bonds of patrician men. It's because of his bond that Thomas has the right to preside over the law, tell the rest of us what the law is and hold himself as the exception to it.\n\nAnd finally, that he knows the rest of us think that's bullshit. He knows that the more we insist on him obeying the same laws everyone else obeys, and that the more he insists that he doesn't - this is a matter of manly virtue, not a matter of democracy - the more the rest of us are going to raise hell.\n\nSo he lied.\n\nIt's too late.\n\nHe already told on himself.\n\nIf a tree doesn't fall in a forest, you can be sure lots of economists will have predicted that a tree was absolutely going to fall.\n\nYou can also be sure that, when the tree doesn't fall, the economists will shrug and shamelessly predict that the tree is going to fall next month for sure. That tree, it is going to fall. They have models.\n\nWhere's the recession? We are, in theory, supposed to be in a recession right now, based on economic predictions from last year. In December 2022, CNBC confidently reported that the next recession would begin in early 2023 . In October, CNN declared , \"The question of a recession is no longer if, but when.\"\n\nBy February, it was clear the predicted recession had not happened . The economy continued to add jobs at a surprising rate.\n\nBut USA Today was undaunted by the good economic news. Sure, it acknowledged, the recession hadn't happened. But it forged gamely ahead: \"More economists think a 2023 downturn may come later than they thought.\"\n\nIf you constantly predict a recession, you'll eventually be right, just like you'll be right sometimes if you always predict rainy days. Economic growth doesn't last forever. In fact, according to an IMF working paper, economies are in recession 10-12 percent of the time.\n\nWeather forecasters don't rely on dumb luck, though. They have models that are very accurate , at least over a week or so.\n\nEconomists on the other hand have ... not much.\n\n2008 and 2020 It's an open secret that economists are terrible at predicting economic downturns. That same 2018 IMF paper looked at recession data from 63 countries between 1992 and 2014. In April of the year before a recession, the average prediction was 3 percent growth. The actual recession year showed a 3 percent contraction . Forecasters typically didn't accurately assess the effect of the recession until it had been underway for a full year.\n\nAs one particularly egregious example, a 2014 study found that economists \"completely failed to anticipate the fall in GDP and employment\" in 2008 - the year of the housing bubble and the Great Recession.\n\nConversely, few people remember that in August 2019, many economists were predicting a recession that could affect the 2020 race. Instead, covid hit, causing massive economic disruptions and unprecedented government expenditures. It was an economic shock for sure. But it wasn't a typical recession.\n\nCovid was impossible to predict with precision. Many people had warned that a pandemic was a dangerous possibility at some point. But the exact timing of natural disasters is almost definitionally unpredictable.\n\nEconomists try to figure out how world events will affect forecasts. But they can't tell you a year out that there's going to be the worst global pandemic in a century, or pinpoint when a Russian dictator is going to decide to invade his neighbor.\n\nThe economy is affected by global events that simply can't be modeled. That makes predicting a recession an exercise in presumption at the best of times.\n\nStill, sometimes economists really should know better. The 2008 recession was the result of a speculative housing bubble. That's the kind of structural weakness that high-priced brainy economists are supposed to warn us about.\n\nPredicting bubbles bursting in advance is very difficult, though, because bubbles are built on false confidence. Once everyone starts predicting the bubble will burst, it bursts. If economists knew the recession was coming earlier in 2008, the recession would have come earlier.\n\nOr to put it another way, while weather forecasters can't affect the weather, economic predictions can very much affect the economy.\n\nIf economists think inflation will keep rising, for instance, the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates - which affects the likelihood of a recession.\n\nThe Fed raising rates is why so many economists have been predicting a recession - even though so far we haven't had one.\n\nNow, though, after the Silicon Valley Bank failure, the Federal Reserve is signaling that it will ease off on aggressive rate hikes - which should in theory make a recession less likely.\n\nUnless, of course, it doesn't.\n\nMaking an unpredictable future less dangerous The economy affects millions of people. Workers are eager to know if they can count on their jobs being there for them in six months. Businesses want to know if they should hire or start firing.\n\nIf you know the future, you can make better plans. You can make a lot of money, or at least prevent yourself from being impoverished.\n\nEconomic predictions are especially valuable in a society as precarious as ours. In the US, about half of adults get health insurance through their employer. Losing your job can precipitate a personal health catastrophe.\n\nThe US also has a weaker social safety net than most peer countries. During economic downturns, most European nations can rely on established programs to kick in and help people. In the US, by contrast, we're dependent on a slow-moving, reactionary Congress to provide aid in times of crisis.\n\nIf economists can't tell what's going to happen year-to-year, average non-expert workers can't be expected to make ideal, wealth-maximizing decisions by correctly intuiting where the economy is going to be.\n\nInstead of trying to anticipate market fluctuations, we need to accept that we don't know what's going to happen, and create programs that help people weather bad outcomes\n\nUniversal free healthcare, direct payments to keep children out of poverty , free college so people can make low-risk investments in the future - programs such as these would reduce our reliance on economic predictions, because we'd be less vulnerable when those predictions go awry.\n\nThe one thing we know about the future is that it is unpredictable. Economists should stop pretending they have crystal balls and start advocating for policies that take into account the fact that none of us knows what tomorrow will bring\n\nBusiness owners are complaining that no one wants to work anymore and there's a labor crisis in America. The crisis is that workers have more leverage and are refusing to work for minimum wage and be treated like crap.\n\nThe obvious solution is raising wages and improving working conditions but some offer a different solution - a return to child labor. After all, children have no work experience, are easily exploited and are unlikely to organize.\n\nRepublicans would rather erode child labor laws than support a living wage. But it's Democrats who have abandoned the working class, amirite?\n\nThe reason Republicans want to erode child labor protections is the exact reason we need these laws - children are easily exploited in the labor market.\n\nThis discussion gets to the heart of labor laws in this country, which is that the concept of \"freedom of contract\" doesn't exist when one party (the employer) has significantly more power than another (the employee).\n\nInitially, many attempts by the labor movement to protect workers from unfair hour requirements and extremely low wages were struck down by the Supreme Court for violating the supposed right to \"freedom of contract.\"\n\nIn Lochner v. New York in 1905, the Supreme Court ruled that the 14th Amendment protected a constitutional right to freedom of contract and, therefore, that a New York state law outlawing bakeries from hiring bakers for more than 10 hours a day or 60 hours a week was unconstitutional.\n\nThe theory was that the bakers should have the freedom to work as many hours as they wanted - discounting coercive pressure by employers to force bakers to work extreme and unsafe hours if they wanted to keep their jobs.\n\nThe Lochner ruling ushered in the \"Lochner Era\" of the Supreme Court and was used to strike down laws forbidding \"yellow-dog contracts\" (contracts that required workers to promise not to join a union) and minimum wage laws out of a belief in laissez-faire economics and \"freedom to contract.\"\n\nThis precedent changed in Nebbia v. New York in 1934 when the Supreme Court ruled there was no constitutional fundamental right to \"freedom of contract,\" and in 1937 in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish , which upheld a minimum wage law. West Coast Hotel v. Parrish stated that economic regulation is reasonable if in the community's best interest. Protecting kids from exploitation seems to me like it's in the best interest of the community.\n\nHistorically, child labor was common. Children often worked on family farms or were apprenticed out to learn a trade when they got a little older.\n\nChild labor became exploitative with the industrial revolution. Children worked away from families in factories. They were paid less than adults. They were often useful for tasks requiring small hands or small stature.\n\nPublic education reformers promoted the importance of public education but laws that required school attendance were rarely enforced or only applied to primary school. (This is probably another reason why Republicans are trying to destroy education. They'll get more workers out of it!).\n\nThe first compulsory education law was passed in Massachusetts in 1852. Mississippi was the last to require primary education for all students in 1917.\n\nThe National Child Labor Committee was founded in 1904 at the same time the larger labor movement was also trying to pass reforms to protect workers from unsafe and unfair labor practices. It served the larger labor movement's goals to restrict child labor because child laborers drove down wages and were less likely to join in strikes and unionizing efforts.\n\nThe National Child Labor Committee hired a photographer to photograph the conditions children were worked in to influence public opinion.\n\nThe Congress passed the first anti-child labor law in 1916. Called the Keating-Owen Child Labor Act , it relied on Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce to ban products from \"any factory, shop, or cannery that employed children under the age of 14, from any mine that employed children under the age of 16, and from any facility that had children under the age of 16 work at night or for more than eight hours during the day.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the law was short-lived. It was struck down by the Supreme Court two years later in Hammer v. Dagenhart when the court said the Congress did not have the power to regulate working conditions. The next attempt - regulating child labor by levying an extra tax on goods made using child labor - was also struck down in Bailey v. Drexel Furniture .\n\nThe Congress finally succeeded in restricting child labor in 1938 with the Fair Labor Standards Act . It established a right to minimum wage, overtime pay, a maximum number of hours that could be worked in jobs related to interstate commerce, and set a minimum age of 16 to work in mining or manufacturing industries. The act was upheld in United States v. Darby Lumber Co in 1941. It was later expanded, in 1949, to include more industries.\n\nToday \" federal labor law prohibits the employment of workers under the age of 14 in non-agricultural settings. Fourteen- and 15-year-olds must work outside of the hours of school and cannot work: more than 3 hours on a school day...more than 18 hours per week when school is in session...\"\n\nLast month, the Arkansas legislature rolled back child-labor protections. Minors under 16 previously needed age verification and work certificates. This requirement has been abolished under the newly passed Youth Hiring Act of 2023. Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders called it an \"arbitrary burden\" but it protected children from exploitation by ensuring that the state was involved in their employment and that those working weren't below 14.\n\nArkansas isn't the only state eroding child labor law to meet labor shortages. Last year, New Jersey expanded the number of hours teens can work. In Minnesota, Republicans proposed allowing teens to work on construction sites. Iowa is considering a bill to allow 14 and 15 year olds to work in industrial laundry services and meatpacking plants while also exempting them from worker's compensation protections. Ohio is considering removing the cap on hours minors can work as long as a parent or guardian approves. These will expose minors to exploitation and dangerous working conditions.\n\nGun violence is the leading cause of death for children because Republicans reject gun-law reforms. Public education is being harmed by anti-history laws and book banning. Now there's a movement to send children back to work, all to avoid raising wages and improving working conditions.\n\nLate Thursday, the Times broke the story of a grand jury in New York voting to indict Donald Trump on more than 30 counts related to a hush-money scheme currently investigated by the Manhattan district attorney's office.\n\nThe criminal former president said two weekends ago that he expected to be arrested the following Tuesday. He dominated headlines, and the resources of law enforcement in New York and Washington, for days. But last night, according to USA Today , Trump was \"shocked\" by the news.\n\nThe story has many angles. Top of mind is that Trump is the first former president in American history to be accused of a crime. The second is whether he'll be convicted. That's hard to say for now. An attorney said he will refuse a plea deal. \"There is no crime,\" Joe Tacopina said on \"Today.\"\n\nSkepticism is in order. Trump is above the law. He has been for years. It's natural to think he'll get off. The rich are different. They have more money.\n\nBut Trump's initial refusal to accept a deal, which hasn't been offered yet, tells us something about his thinking. If Trump were going to get off, on account of being rich (and having more money), an indictment would never have been brought in the first place. The DA's office would have found reasonsreasons not to. So in a sense, the indictment itself is the hard part. Trump knows this. That's why he was \"shocked.\" If you're going after the king, you best not miss. Trump suspects DA Alvin Bragg isn't going to miss.\n\nIf Bragg isn't going to miss, and Trump probably believes he won't, he needs another way to win that doesn't involve evidence, facts and the law. We know what he's going to do. He'll turn the trial into a televised extravaganza so the public can't tell whether Bragg is right, and real crimes have been committed, or whether Trump is right - all of this is a witch hunt, he has said and will continue saying. In rightwing politics, Trump is a martyr .\n\nHe'll do something else. We know he will. He will attempt to incite violence among his followers. He believes that will send a message - trying to bring down Trump is trying to bring down America. If the public fears blood in the streets, well, there's an obvious solution. Trump gets off scot-free.\n\nWe know he'll do this, because he's already done it. In the weeks before the J6 insurrection, Trump and his allies whipped his followers into a thick foam. They whipped them so much that followers became nihilists. There was no tomorrow if the enemy were not defeated today. That was costly. Over 1,000 of them have been prosecuted so far. The foam faded.\n\nIt will likely stay faded. Two weekends ago, when Trump said he expected to be arrested, he called for \"protests,\" meaning the revival of the spirit of the J6 insurrection. Law enforcement in New York and the Capitol prepared themselves for the revival. But it never came. Of those few who did protest, they were outnumbered by news cameras covering their demonstration.\n\nIn a piece published Monday, a reporter for the Christian Science Monitor asked why. Why would loyalists who stormed the Capitol in an attempted takeover of the United States government fail to show up? The answer appears to be two-tiered. On the one hand, loyalists fear prosecution and the subsequent ruination of their lives. On the other hand, they see the ruination of insurrectionists' lives and think - where was Donald Trump?\n\n\"Trump asked people to protest after the 2020 election, then abandoned them. ... Trump abandoned some of his most faithful followers,\" Rick McCargar told the Christian Science Monitor in Waco . \"I look at this [then-pending indictment] and say, 'He didn't do anything to help those people.' So would I stand out in the rain, sleet, or snow for him now? No.\"\n\nThe other way for Donald Trump to beat the charges against him is by winning the 2024 election (presuming it's still US Department of Justice policy never to indict a sitting president). That's where the trial and the incitement of violence come together. While followers may fear the legal consequences of \"protesting\" for Trump, and while some of them accuse him of abandoning his followers, they still seem ready to vote for him.\n\nWhile \"it's clear the aftermath of Jan. 6 has left a bitter taste - and soured at least some of them on the man himself,\" reported the Christian Science Monitor . \"Many say they will probably still vote for Mr. Trump in 2024.\"\n\nSo Trump won't only be the first former president to be accused of a crime. He will be the first former president to run for president for a second time while under indictment. What's more, he has such a hold on his followers that they will vote for him - despite his being under indictment and despite their harboring feelings of betrayal. For them, one-way loyalty is jim-dandy.\n\nThis aspect of Trump's power is underappreciated. Put another way, this expression of loyalty is misunderstood. To normal people, loyalty is equitable. I got your back. You got mine. You break that trust, I stop trusting you. Such are the stakes of individuals working cooperatively.\n\nBut loyalty among Trump supporters isn't that. It's about power. It's about fear of Trump's power. It's about the fear of being cast out of the group for taking a stand against the man who betrayed the group. It's about the fear of the consequences of privileging individual interest above the group's.\n\nSo Trump isn't just inciting violence to intimidate prosecutors in the hope he'll get off the charges against him. His incitement doesn't just scare normal people. It scares his people, too. If he wants to win the Republican Party's nomination, and he likely will, Trump must keep them that way.\n\nAt a campaign rally in Iowa on January 23, 2016, Donald Trump boasted that his voting base was so loyal to him that he \"could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose voters, ok? It's like, incredible.\"\n\nWell, I guess we will soon find out, won't we?\n\nA grand jury convened by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has voted to indict the former president on what some outlets claim are 34 charges stemming from $130,000 in hush money paid to Stormy Daniels, a pornographic film star, director, and entertainer, whose birth name - which she prefers not to use - is Stephanie Clifford.\n\nAs recently as six days ago, at his Waco rally, Trump denied ever having had sex with Clifford, who he referred to as \"Horseface.\" So obviously, he is willing to lose the sex worker vote. But Trump and the nitwit chorus line of GOP politicians also characterize the indictment as \" political persecution .\"\n\nYet Bragg must have evidence, not just testimony, that the payoff took place, so it will be interesting to see how Trump's lawyers explain what the money was actually for.\n\nPresumably, the Trump campaign believed the Former Guy's candidacy could withstand one sex scandal, but not two. But the tragedy in all of this may have been that they may have been wrong.\n\nIn early October 2016, the release of the Access Hollywood tape, in which Trump boasted that he could \"grab [women] by the pussy\" and get away with it, became a survivable scandal.\n\nBy contrast, when Trump's consigliere and fixer, Michael Cohen, paid Daniels for her silence, we had known for decades that Trump was a serial adulterer. Would one infidelity more or less have changed the equation?\n\nI don't think so.\n\nBut I do have to wonder if what Trump was potentially embarrassed about, given that he sought to project an image of being universally irresistible to beautiful women, was the implication that he had paid for sex.\n\nWhile many news outlets characterize the $130,000 payout as covering up an \"affair,\" what Trump and Daniels allegedly did was not what most of us would think of as an affair.\n\nInstead, it was a series of phone conversations (I am guessing phone sex) and sexual encounters over two years . The relationship, which may have had a commercial dimension from the get-go, began with a dinner invitation in 2006, culminating in, as Daniels deadpanned at the Stand Up NY comedy club in Manhattan in 2019 , \"The worst 90 seconds of my life.\"\n\nIt was a terrible job, girlfriend, but someone had to do it. And I bet Melania would say the same thing if she were being honest.\n\nBesides the fact that our legal system is not yet broken, there are three lessons in this.\n\nFirst, you should probably never try to shame a successful sex entrepreneur into silence. By definition, a woman who has exposed everything she has to reveal and made a small fortune from it is not subject to convention.\n\nSecond, when you have paid off said woman, don't follow up by threatening her : she is a fucking professional.\n\nAnd third, Daniels would sue if Trump defamed her. If you are a porn star, there is literally no such thing as bad publicity.\n\nSince the news broke about the indictment last night, right before the 6 o'clock news hour, there has been much hysteria about whether Trump's \"base\" will react by taking to the streets, committing acts of violence and successfully redoubling their efforts to return him to the White House in 2024.\n\nNone of these things will happen.\n\nFor one, people underestimate the effects of the prosecutions stemming from the January 6, 2021, insurrection. As far as I can tell, almost none of those people believed they would be arrested and charged. Those who thought they were in legal jeopardy believed they would be pardoned in the waning days of the Trump presidency. They know differently now.\n\nIndividual acts of violence are possible, but we live in a country where rightwing extremists do these things almost daily. So do they really need a new reason? No.\n\nAnd finally, the 2024 election. Whether the Trump base consolidates around this indictment, or subsequent one, doesn't matter. We, and the numerous outraged bags of hot air that call themselves Republican politicians, have direct evidence that Donald Trump not only can't win a national election with only his own voters but that at least part of that base has shifted to Ron DeSantis.\n\nThat voting constituency isn't enthusiastic about chaos, threats of violence and whether you can be president from jail. In other words, Trump needs moderate Republican and independent voters more than he ever has, and he has less access to them than ever.\n\nLook at the evidence: Trump lost the \"I'm-not-crazy-but-vote-Republican\" demographic in the 2018 midterms. He lost it in 2020. And all signs point to the fact that, except for a few races where Trump-backed candidates prevailed in 2022, what a Trump endorsement accomplished was to nominate an extremist that even Republicans ran away from. Ask Arizona's Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs if you don't believe me.\n\nI have been skeptical about a Trump comeback for a long time. This is not because the net is closing on a man who has probably committed far more crimes than he will ever be charged with, but because he is a highly idiosyncratic and disorganized person.\n\nAnd the best evidence is this: Trump's legal demise has begun with the most unnecessary crime he will be charged with. Why?\n\nBecause he was too cheap to pay off Stormy Daniels with his own money and too stupid to admit the error and file corrected forms with the IRS and the Federal Election Commission. Worse? He underestimated a woman who has a far cannier head for business and more courage than he has ever had.\n\nSo Stormy Daniels? I salute you, girl. Thank you for your service.\n\nExpect the Republicans to remain silent in the immediate aftermath of the massacre Monday, in Nashville, that left three adults and three 9-year-old kids literally shot to pieces. The shooter is also dead.\n\nThis is a familiar pattern. While the Democrats, this time led by Joe BIden, demand that Congress renew the ban on semiautomatic rifles (\"assault weapons\"), the Republicans will offer no more than prayers for families of the victims, and gratitude for \"first responders.\"\n\nAt some point, however, maybe a week, the Republicans will break their silence. They will re-dedicate themselves to preserving the Second Amendment and the right to self-defense. They will accuse the Democrats of \"politicizing a tragedy.\" They will also fake being outraged by the risk of \"infringing the rights of law abiding citizens.\"\n\nWe know this pattern of behavior will recur, because we've seen it so many times over the last 20 years, the period after the Congress allowed the old ban on the sale of semiautomatic weapons to expire. We also know, on account of this past behavior, that the Republicans, who control the House, won't do a damn thing to stop mass death.\n\nThat's the end of one story, but it should be the beginning of another, a story waiting to be told by liberals in a context of democratic politics about what the Republicans really care about and what they really want. They don't want to solve problems. They don't want to help people. They want to control people, especially outpeople who use democratic politics to undermine \"the natural order of things.\"\n\nThat they want to control outpeople was evident Monday in rightwing discourse on the shooter, Audrey Hale. The Nashville police chief said that she was transgender. Whether that's true remains to be seen. But for rightwingers, that was enough to call for a crackdown. Guns didn't shoot six people to pieces. \"Wokeness\" did.\n\nFrom this, you can see the punitive desire behind rightwing politics. On the one hand, the government can't do anything to stop mass death because stopping it might \"infringe the rights of law abiding citizens.\" On the other hand, the government must do something about \"wokeness,\" because failing to act will lead only to mass death!\n\nHow do the Second Amendment rights of trans people figure into this thinking? They don't, because outpeople don't deserve them.\n\nThey are not \"law-abiding citizens.\"\n\nIf trans people are not included among \"law-abiding citizens,\" that means that \"the law\" isn't the law, but \"God's law,\" which, from the rightwing viewpoint, puts white Christian men on top of society - the natural order of things. There are males and there are females. Being trans breaks God's law. Lawbreakers deserve punishment.\n\nThat we talk at all about trans people is a consequence of democratic politics, of outpeople raising hell until a majority starts listening and is brought around to the reality of trans people. So rightwing politics not only seeks to punish trans people for breaking God's law. It seeks to punish anyone using democratic politics. If the law won't do it, then God's people are free to take the law into their own hands.\n\nThis is why I have argued that shooting massacres are, one way or another, an outcome of democratic politics running up against God's law. To adherents, the law is a gun. A gun is the law. If God's people fail democratically - if they fail to gain control of the government in order to enact laws that will punish outpeople - they are free to take the law into their own hands. If mass death is the result, so be it.\n\nIn other words, mass death, or the threat of mass death, is another way in rightwing politics to control people, especially outpeople, who don't buy guns the way God's people do. The people with the most guns are the people most in control. The right to bear arms is the right of God's people to force outpeople to stay where they belong.\n\nWhen the Republicans finally break their silence, maybe in a week, to say that they can't and won't use the government to solve the problem of mass death, that's because, to them, mass death isn't a problem. Mass death is a means to an end, which is social control.\n\nTo be sure, Audrey Hale does not fit the profile. Whether she's transgender or not, it's rare for shooters not to be white men. It happens, but these are not exceptions to the rule. They prove it. After all, if you're a target of punishment, for breaking God's law, for being who you are, you might think if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.\n\n\"If a child is on the verge of starvation, you must call CPS, not spend hundreds of millions on disproportionately unhealthy lunches, a huge percentage of which are discarded,\" conservative pundit Ben Shapiro told California Congressman Ted Lieu on Twitter.\n\nShapiro is wrong. There's a great deal of evidence that free school lunches reduce student hunger and improve children's health.\n\nConservatives don't necessarily care about good outcomes, though. That's because they don't want good outcomes. They want to police people.\n\nThe discourse around school lunches is a brutal, disturbing example of the broader carceral logic of rightwing politics.\n\nRepublicans and those on the right believe that government should be used not to help those in need, but to punish and discipline marginalized people.\n\nSchool lunches have been studied extensively , and there's little question that they improve health outcomes for children.\n\nContrary to Shapiro's claim that school lunches are unhealthy, research finds that children who receive free school meals are more likely to receive daily adequate nutrition and more likely to eat fruits and vegetables, and drink milk.\n\nShapiro also argues that school lunches are economically inefficient. He believes poor families don't really exist, and that if children are hungry, it's because they're being abused, and they should be taken away from their parents.\n\nThis is ludicrous. Real hunger and poverty do exist in the US. There are families that do not have money to afford both rent and food. There are families who want to care for their children but lack the resources to do so.\n\nThe US government estimates that 12.5 percent of households with children are food insecure, which means that there are times when they do not have enough food to feed everyone in the family.\n\nIn most cases, adults feed children first. But even given that, in 6.3 percent of households, children experienced food insecurity.\n\nSchool meal programs are also incredibly efficient. One study found that every dollar spent on school meal programs saves two dollars in reduced health care costs and reduced poverty.\n\nA study of Sweden found that free school lunch programs resulted in 3 percent higher lifetime earnings for children.\n\nThe greatest gains in earnings were among the poorest students. But even more affluent students benefited.\n\nIn contrast, when CPS removes children from their home, they are at great risk. Children in the foster care system have higher risk of learning disabilities, depression, asthma and obesity. They are less likely to go to college .\n\nCPS investigations also disproportionately target Black students. More than 50 percent of Black children in the US are subject to child welfare investigations.\n\nDiscrimination is widespread . School officials are more likely to call child welfare about Black children. CPS is more likely to investigate Black families. Courts are more likely to remove Black children from homes.\n\nEven if a family is not feeding their child as well as they could, school lunches are often a better option than removing children from the home.\n\nDirect aid can help children in difficult situations, whereas the foster care system can be traumatic and make things worse even for children with neglectful parents.\n\nSchool lunches reduce hunger, improve children's lives, and reduce costs to society. Child welfare interventions are frequently racist and have negative health and education outcomes for children. They should be a last resort, not a substitute for aid.\n\nSo why does Shapiro prefer calling the authorities on poor families, rather than just helping them feed their children?\n\nDan McLaughlin, a writer at National Review , elucidated. He wrote a Twitter thread arguing that school lunches should be rolled back and child labor laws should be weakened.\n\n\"Literally, a 'free lunch' vs working,\" he fulminated. \"Perpetual childhood vs responsibility.\"\n\nMcLaughlin and Shapiro see aid to hungry children as an assault on virtue. Having money is equated with work is equated with discipline and moral fiber.\n\nFeeding your children is a test of character. Those who succeed are good, upstanding people, who need no help from the dangerous liberal state.\n\nThose who fail are lazy and disreputable, and they should be policed by the virtuous conservative state.\n\nMost people can see this logic is repulsive. Shapiro and McLaughlin think children should be denied food (and forced to work?!) in order to punish their parents for lack of discipline.\n\nThat's obviously monstrous.\n\nBut these arguments undergird much of how we approach poverty and the social safety net.\n\nOne egregious example is from 2021. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot took $281.5 million in covid relief funds - which could have been used on air filtration in schools, or to vaccinate underserved communities - and instead gave it to police .\n\nNationwide, since the 2008 recession, police budgets have rebounded, but education budgets have languished .\n\nSpending money to help people in trouble - on schools, on health care, on libraries, on direct aid to children in poverty - is cost-effective and humane.\n\nBut instead, we often choose to disinvest and then to criminalize the hunger, poverty and desperation that results.\n\nThis is the argument of the much-demonized defund the police movement.\n\nActivists and advocates argue that helping people in need is more equitable, more just, and ultimately more cost-effective than immiserating people and then sending law-enforcement after them to immiserate them further.\n\nDo we want to pay to feed hungry children? Or would we rather pay law enforcement to harass them and their families?\n\nBen Shapiro, Dan McLaughlin and their ilk want to spend money on punitive authorities, because they dream of a world in which everyone is kept in their place by force.\n\nThey oppose school lunches and every policy that has the potential to make the US more equal and more free.\n\n\"We demand rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty!\" exclaims a disgruntled philosopher in Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy .\n\nThe philosophers had banded together to protest the advancement of computer science, which they believed was imposing entirely too much clarity on the existential mysteries that gave them job security.\n\nThe Idaho GOP and a coalition of antichoice groups in the state are taking a similar tack regarding the state's murky and punitive abortion law.\n\nThis session, two Republican state legislators introduced a bill that would clarify key concepts in the state's felony abortion ban. These include defining when an abortion is necessary to save the life of the pregnant person, and confirming once and for all that it's not a felony to treat ectopic and nonviable pregnancies and to remove fetuses that have died.\n\nIt would also stop doctors who perform life-saving abortions from automatically being dragged before a judge to plead medical necessity as an affirmative defense.\n\nWhatever happens with the felony abortion ban, Idaho doctors risk devastating lawsuits for treating one of the most common and dangerous gynecological emergencies: ectopic pregnancy.\n\nEctopic pregnancies are fertilized eggs that implant outside the uterus. These rogue ova will never become babies and they can kill the patient if they're allowed to swell like a tumor on a speedrun.\n\nIt's all about the uncertainty. A doctor doesn't know if she's going to get sued by a vengeful ex for treating an ectopic pregnancy, but it could happen. Uncertainty can be even more paralyzing than a clear-cut but draconian rule.\n\nRigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty can paralyze doctors while letting legislators off the hook for self-evidently stupid and unpopular policies, like forcing patients to wait in agonizing pain until their fallopian tubes rupture and their abdomens fill with blood. Or for letting bacteria rot their uteruses, and surge through their bodies, because their doomed fetus still has a heartbeat.\n\nThe Idaho Republican Party sent out an email Tuesday night claiming that the proposed changes were a ruse by doctors to \"have more leeway to perform abortions in Idaho.\" The head of the far-right Idaho Family Policy Center fretted in an email to supporters that a \"special interest group\" had drafted some of the language.\n\nThat group is the Idaho Medical Association, an utterly mainstream group that has been promoting medical excellence in the state since 1893. A hearing on the bill has been postponed amid the antichoice outcry.\n\nThe chilling effects of Idaho's abortion laws are already being felt.\n\nThe only hospital serving a town of 9,000 people recently announced that it would no longer deliver babies in part because of the abortion ban . Families will soon have to drive 45 miles to deliver their babies. It was always a challenge to attract qualified doctors to small rural towns, but Idaho's abortion politics are accelerating the brain drain. Doctors are fleeing the state because they don't want to live in legal limbo. They don't want to have to choose between satisfying their professional ethics and obeying the law. The law is so vague that it chills doctors who don't even do abortions.\n\nWe've seen in state after state that exceptions to save the life of the pregnant person offer little practical protection. When a doctor might face a lengthy prison term, he or she will probably find an excuse to delay care, even when it endangers the life of a patient.\n\nEven the antichoice movement is tiring of the charade. Instead of grappling with the ethical implications of denying life-saving care, national antichoice groups have started promulgating the absurd lie that abortion is never medically necessary .\n\nIn 2022, the Idaho Republicans voted nearly four to one to amend their party platform to criminalize all abortions, including lifesaving terminations. An exception for ectopic pregnancies was proposed and rejected.\n\nWhen the goal is cruelty, uncertainty is a valuable commodity, and Idaho antichoicers have rallied to defend it."

Banner at center reads \"France is the fabric of migratation.\" (AP Photo/Christophe Ena)\n\nPARIS (AP) - A coalition of the French left won the most seats in high-stakes legislative elections Sunday, beating back a far-right surge but failing to win a majority. The outcome left France, a pillar of the European Union and Olympic host country, facing the stunning prospect of a hung parliament and political paralysis.\n\nThe political turmoil could rattle markets and the French economy, the EU's second-largest, and have far-ranging implications for the war in Ukraine , global diplomacy and Europe's economic stability.\n\nIn calling the election on June 9 , after the far right surged in French voting for the European Parliament, President Emmanuel Macron said turning to voters again would provide \"clarification.\"\n\nOn almost every level, that gamble appears to have backfired. According to the official results released early Monday , all three main blocs fell far short of the 289 seats needed to control the 577-seat National Assembly, the more powerful of France's two legislative chambers.\n\nThe results showed just over 180 seats for the New Popular Front leftist coalition, which placed first, ahead of Macron's centrist alliance, with more than 160 seats. Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally and its allies were restricted to third place, although their more than 140 seats were still way ahead of the party's previous best showing - 89 seats in 2022.\n\nA hung parliament is unknown territory for modern France.\n\n\"Our country is facing an unprecedented political situation and is preparing to welcome the world in a few weeks,\" said Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who plans to offer his resignation later in the day.\n\nWith the Paris Olympics looming, Attal said he was ready to stay at his post \"as long as duty demands.\" Macron has three years remaining on his presidential term.\n\nAttal made clearer than ever his disapproval of Macron's shock decision to call the election, saying \"I didn't choose this dissolution\" of the outgoing National Assembly, where the president's centrist alliance used to be single biggest group, albeit without an absolute majority. Still, it was able to govern for two years, pulling in lawmakers from other camps to fight off efforts to bring it down.\n\nThe new legislature appears shorn of such stability. When Macron flies to Washington for a summit this week of the NATO alliance , he will leave a country with no clear idea who may be its next prime minister and facing the prospect that the president may be obliged to share power with a politician deeply opposed to his policies.\n\nStill, many rejoiced. In Paris' Stalingrad square, supporters on the left cheered and applauded as projections showing the alliance ahead flashed up on a giant screen. Cries of joy also rang out in Republique plaza in eastern Paris, with people spontaneously hugging strangers and several minutes of nonstop applause after the projections landed.\n\nMarielle Castry, a medical secretary, was on the Metro in Paris when projected results were first announced.\n\n\"Everybody had their smartphones and were waiting for the results and then everybody was overjoyed,\" said the 55-year-old. \"I had been stressed out since June 9 and the European elections. ... And now, I feel good. Relieved.\"\n\nEven before votes were cast, the election redrew France's political map. It galvanized parties on the left to put differences aside and join together in the new leftist alliance. It pledges to roll back many of Macron's headline reforms, embark on a massively costly program of public spending and take a far tougher line against Israel because of the war with Hamas.\n\nMacron described the left's coalition as \"extreme\" and warned that its economic program of many tens of billions of euros in public spending, partly financed by tax hikes for high earners and on wealth, could be ruinous for France, already criticized by EU watchdogs for its debt.\n\nYet, the New Popular Front's leaders immediately pushed Macron to give the alliance the first chance to form a government and propose a prime minister.\n\nThe most prominent of the leftist coalition's leaders, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, said it \"is ready to govern.\"\n\nWhile the National Rally took more seats than ever, the anti-immigration party with historical links to antisemitism and racism fell far short of its hopes of securing an absolute majority that would have given France its first far-right government since World War II.\n\n\"Disappointed, disappointed,\" said far-right supporter Luc Doumont, 66. \"Well, happy to see our progression, because for the past few years we've been doing better.\"\n\nAfter the party finished top of the first-round vote last weekend, its rivals worked to dash its hopes of outright victory Sunday, by strategically withdrawing candidates from many districts. That left many far-right candidates in head-to-head contests against just one opponent, making it harder for them to win.\n\nMany voters decided that keeping the far right from power was more important to them than anything else, backing its opponents in the runoff, even if they weren't from the political camp they usually support.\n\nStill, National Rally leader Le Pen, expected to make a fourth run for the French presidency in 2027, said the elections laid the groundwork for \"the victory of tomorrow.\"\n\n\"The reality is that our victory is only deferred,\" she added. But Le Pen's older sister, Marie-Caroline, was among her party's losers Sunday, defeated by a leftist candidate and just 225 votes in her district.\n\nJordan Bardella , Le Pen's 28-year-old protégé who'd been hoping to become prime minister, rued that the national outcome \"throws France into the arms of the extreme left.\"\n\nA statement from Macron's office indicated that he wouldn't be rushed into inviting a potential prime minister to form a government. It said he was watching as results came in and would wait for the new National Assembly to take shape before taking \"the necessary decisions.\"\n\nUnlike other countries in Europe that are more accustomed to coalition governments, France doesn't have a tradition of lawmakers from rival political camps coming together to form a majority. France is also more centralized than many other European countries, with many more decisions made in Paris.\n\nThe president was hoping that with France's fate in their hands, voters might shift from the far right and left and return to mainstream parties closer to the center - where Macron found much of the support that won him the presidency in 2017 and again in 2022.\n\nBut rather than rally behind him, millions of voters seized on his surprise decision as an opportunity to vent their anger about inflation, crime, immigration and other grievances - including Macron's style of government.\n\nThe sharp polarization of French politics - especially in this torrid and quick campaign - is sure to complicate any effort to form a government. Racism and antisemitism marred the electoral campaign, along with Russian disinformation campaigns , and more than 50 candidates reported being physically attacked - highly unusual for France.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to remove exact seat tallies reported by French media to account for the fact that official results don't give precise totals for each main bloc.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Barbara Surk in Nice, France, and Helena Alves, Diane Jeantet, Jade Le Deley, and Alex Turnbull in Paris contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's global election coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/global-elections/\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nLA CROSSE, Wis. (AP) - A Republican candidate for Congress in western Wisconsin said during a campaign stop last week that \"leftists\" cannot be Christians.\n\n\"There are many God-fearing Christians who are Democrats, there's not a single God-fearing Christian that is a leftist, because those two things are incompatible,\" said Derrick Van Orden, a Donald Trump-endorsed retired Navy SEAL who was photographed on or near the grounds of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 , 2021, after rioters breached the building.\n\nVan Orden is running in Wisconsin's open 3rd Congressional District against Democrat Brad Pfaff. Van Orden made the comments at a prayer breakfast in the city of Sparta.\n\nVan Orden called for a return to Judeo-Christian values that he said \"this country was based on.\" His comments were first reported by the La Crosse Tribune , which received an audio recording from Pfaff.\n\nIn a statement to the Tribune, Van Orden said his comments were referencing communism, which \"abolishes all religion, and all morality.\" However, Van Orden has referred to Pfaff, whose only political membership is with the Democratic Party, as a \"radical leftist.\"\n\n\"As a God-fearing, practicing Lutheran, I am really really disappointed. I'm outraged by comments like that,\" Pfaff told the Tribune.\n\nVan Orden also said at the breakfast that he is a member of the Bible Baptist Church, which lists homosexuality alongside bestiality and incest as \"sinful perversions.\" The church's statement of faith also professes that women should be barred from leadership positions and that Christians should be barred from suing one another.\n\nThe congressional seat is open due to the retirement of Democratic Rep. Ron Kind. He barely defeated Van Orden in 2020 in the district that is trending Republican.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela (AP) - Leftist activists from around Latin America on Friday gathered at a Caracas forum that drew criticism from opponents who say the country is wasting meager resources to entertain hundreds of international guests.\n\nDelegates from Brazil, Colombia, Puerto Rico and other places flocked to a hotel for the four-day Sao Paulo Forum, first held in Brazil in 1990. Some wore Che Guevara T-shirts and posed for photos, while others passed by stalls selling handbags made by indigenous communities.\n\nA sign said \"Trump, Unblock Venezuela,\" suggesting U.S. sanctions aimed at toppling President Nicolás Maduro are driving the country's economic problems.\n\nElsewhere in Caracas, a small group of protesters blamed government looting and mismanagement for Venezuela's humanitarian crisis. Protesters included members of Justice First, an opposition party that said Venezuelan funds were being spent on delegates who \"came to the country to support a dictator who violates human rights.\"\n\nThe forum comes just days after a nationwide, nine-hour blackout knocked out power and communications to Caracas and much of the country, similar to much longer outages in March.\n\nBut some experts offered a nuanced picture, saying the economy has already long been in a tailspin and that U.S. sanctions targeting the oil industry and financial transactions are making things worse.\n\nOn Friday, lights blazed in conference rooms at the Hotel Alba, the forum venue that was once part of the international Hilton hotel chain.\n\nRosa Elvinia Beltrán, a Colombian delegate, said her goal in Venezuela was to publicize the killing of community leaders in her country.\n\n\"It's hard to find solutions,\" Beltrán said. \"We have to do it through protest.\"\n\nFor Venezuelan delegate José Castillo, Venezuela is ground zero for an old ideological divide, led by a Russia-backed government that professes to be a champion of socialism and is in conflict with what he called \"the biggest imperialist power in the world.\"\n\nThe United States and dozens of other countries back Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who said Maduro's re-election last year was a sham and declared himself interim president in January. Despite intensifying pressure, Maduro has held on to power with the military's support.\n\nThe Sao Paulo forum, held almost annually and hosted by Cuba last year, was founded as Latin American leftists sought to re-organize after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.\n\nOne forum visitor Friday was Segun Showunmi, a political opposition figure from Nigeria who came to assess Latin America's left. He said many groups appeared to be \"hung up on the ideology of liberators\" such as Fidel Castro, but that he liked their enthusiasm.\n\n\"I think they're not doing too badly,\" Showunmi said. \"I think they could be better on organization.\"\n\nSpeakers delivered routine denunciations of the United States. But at a booth depicting Venezuelan public works projects, state engineer Ovidio Morillo warmly welcomed an American visitor from New York and asked about his favorite baseball team.\n\n\"Yankees or Mets?\" asked Morillo, who said he personally preferred the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\n___\n\nFollow Christopher Torchia on Twitter at www.twitter.com/torchiachris\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The outcome leaves France facing the stunning prospect of a hung parliament and threatens political paralysis in a pillar of the European Union and Olympic host country.\n\nHere's what to know:\n\nFar-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon speaking last month. (AP Photo/Louise Delmotte)\n\nMélenchon has long been a figure on the left, first in the Socialist Party and as a senator. He founded the hard-left France Unbowed party in 2016 but failed to reach the presidential runoff in 2017 and 2022. He then allied his party with the Socialists, Communists and greens to form the New Popular Ecological and Social Union.\n\nMélenchon is a divisive figure who angers many moderates. The alliance fell into disarray because of divisions over the Hamas-Israel war. The France Unbowed party condemned the conduct of Israel's war against Hamas and accused it of pursuing genocide against Palestinians. Party leaders denied antisemitism.\n\nThen last month, Mélenchon's party joined a similar alliance that was quickly thrown together for snap elections in response to the prospect of the far right gaining power. The alliance had more luck this time, winning the largest number of seats.\n\nAt the Place de la Republique. (AP Photo/Louise Delmotte)\n\nHere's a look at the final results from the second round. According to the Interior Ministry, the leftist coalition has taken the most seats in parliament, with at least 181. Macron's centrists have more than 160 seats. Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally have 143 seats after leading in the first round.\n\nNo majority for anyone.

A deal could take the form of a loose, informal alliance that likely would be fragile. And already, leaders of the leftist New Popular Front are pushing Macron to give their alliance the first chance to form a government and propose a prime minister to share power with him.\n\nIf he can't make a deal, Macron could name a government of experts unaffiliated with political parties to handle the day-to-day work of keeping one of Europe's largest countries running. But that would require parliamentary approval. And the first session with new members of the 577-seat National Assembly is July 18.\n\nMeanwhile, no clear figure has emerged as a possible prime minister. Macron's office has said he would wait for the new National Assembly to take shape before taking \"the necessary decisions.\"\n\n▶ Read more about what's next\n\nMidnight has passed in mainland France.

It includes environmentalist parties, the French Socialists and Communists and the hard-left France Unbowed party.\n\nAhead of Sunday's vote, the leaders of the alliance's four main parties promised unwavering support for Ukraine.

And any cobbled-together majority risks being vulnerable to no-confidence votes that could cause it to fall.\n\nThis is uncharted territory for France. Unlike other countries in Europe that are more accustomed to coalition governments, France doesn't have a tradition of lawmakers from rival political camps coming together to form a working majority.\n\nFar-left La France Insoumise - LFI - (France Unbowed) founder Jean-Luc Melenchon delivers a speech at the party election night headquarters, Sunday, July 7, 2024 in Paris.

He is the first pro-independence candidate to win a seat in the National Assembly since 1986.\n\nIndigenous Kanaks have long sought to break free from France, which took the archipelago in 1853. Polls closed earlier in New Caledonia because of a curfew imposed in response to the violence that flared last month, leaving nine people dead.

(AP Photo/Thibault Camus)\n\nLe Pen planted herself in the northern town of Henin-Beaumont in the early 2000s, hoping to win over disenchanted voters feeling left behind by the new economy. It was the start of a decade-long effort to detoxify her anti-immigration National Rally and win over voters from across French society.\n\nAlthough France has some of the highest standards of living in the world, lower unemployment than it's had in decades and a relatively low crime rate, discontent has simmered in some areas in the post-industrial era. For many National Rally voters, last Sunday's victory is revenge on a political class that they see as out of touch with everyday people and their concerns including crime, purchasing power and immigration.\n\nHenin-Beaumont is where Le Pen began to turn her father's party from political pariah to a voter-friendly alternative. She sought to replicate that strategy on the national level when she took the reins of the party in 2012.\n\n▶ Read more about Le Pen's early success in Henin-Beaumont .\n\nFILE - People use their smartphones near the Olympic rings that are displayed on the Eiffel Tower in Paris, June 7, 2024 in Paris.

(AP Photo/Andreea Alexandru)\n\nBUCHAREST, Romania (AP) - Romania's Social Democratic Party looked set to win the most votes in Sunday's parliamentary election, incomplete data showed, while far-right populists were on track to make significant gains in the country's legislature. The voting suggested widespread anti-establishment sentiment in the European Union and NATO member country.\n\nWith about 85% of the votes counted, incomplete electoral data showed the leftist PSD leading the polls with about 23.9%, while the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, or AUR, was in second place with about 17.8%. The center-right National Liberal Party, or PNL, stood at about 14.5% and the reformist Save Romania Union party, the USR, was at 10.9%.\n\nThe legislative vote came a week after the first round of a presidential race that saw a controversial far-right populist who was polling in single digits win the most votes , which has since plunged the country into political turmoil. Calin Georgescu, 62, is due to face reformist Elena Lasconi of the USR in a Dec. 8 runoff.\n\nDespite only being formed last year, the little-known right-wing populist Party of Young People - which has backed Georgescu for the presidency - appeared on track to pass the 5% threshold to enter parliament, as did the far-right nationalist S.O.S. Romania party. However, some diaspora votes were still being counted and could alter the outcome.\n\nIncumbent Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu, who came in third in the first round of the presidential race and resigned as PSD leader, said after polls closed that they \"need to look carefully\" at Sunday's results. \"It is an important signal that the Romanians sent to the political class,\" he warned.\n\nGeorge Simion, the controversial 38-year-old AUR leader who is a vocal supporter of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, told the media that the anti-establishment gains amounted to a \"watershed moment\" for Romania.\n\n\"It is a moment when, through our common will, Romania is reborn,\" he said. \"We are here ... generation after generation, proving that nothing can defeat a united nation.\"\n\nIn 2020, the AUR party went from relative obscurity to gaining 9% in a parliamentary vote, allowing it to enter parliament. It proclaims to stand for \"family, nation, faith, and freedom.\"\n\nWhen polls closed locally at 9 p.m., about 9.4 million people - about 52.3% of eligible voters - had cast ballots, according to the Central Election Bureau. It was the biggest turnout in a parliamentary election since 2004. The vote will elect a new government and prime minister and determine the formation of the 466-seat legislature.\n\nMany observers believe the presidential outcome indicated a sharp shift from Romania's mainstream parties to more populist anti-establishment parties, whose voices have found fertile ground amid high inflation, high cost of living and a sluggish economy.\n\nThe parliamentary election was sandwiched between two rounds of the presidential race, the first of which sent shockwaves through the political establishment and led to allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference.\n\nGeorgescu's success, which many have attributed to his rapid rise in popularity on the social media platform TikTok, has triggered nightly protests throughout Romania by those who oppose his past remarks praising Romanian fascist leaders and Russian President Vladimir Putin and view him as a threat to democracy.\n\nAccording to a report by Expert Forum, a Bucharest-based think tank, Georgescu's TikTok account before last week's vote saw an explosion of engagement, which it said appeared \"sudden and artificial, similar to his polling results.\"\n\nWithout naming Georgescu, who declared zero campaign spending, Romania's top defense body said Thursday that \"a presidential candidate benefited from massive exposure due to preferential treatment\" granted by TikTok. Romania has become a \"priority target for hostile actions\" by Russia, it added. The Kremlin denies it is meddling.\n\nThe same day, the Constitutional Court requested a recount of all 9.4 million votes after a presidential candidate who obtained 1% filed a complaint alleging the USR had violated electoral laws against campaign activities on polling day. The Central Election Bureau approved the request and said scanned reports were due to be sent in by Sunday night. On Friday, the court postponed a decision until Monday on whether to annul the vote.\n\nLasconi, the USR leader and former journalist, vowed on Sunday evening that \"if we are united, the Russian bots on TikTok cannot destroy our democracy.\"\n\n\"I understand what is happening in society, I understand the anger, I understand the frustrations and that is why I am here now,\" she said. \"We really need to make a change and rewrite the political elite.\"\n\nCristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, told The Associated Press ahead of Sunday's vote that Georgescu's success indicated that far-right parties would obtain record highs.\n\n\"The impact of the surprise in last Sunday's presidential election will be significant, and we are going to wake up in a new political reality,\" he told The Associated Press. \"Georgescu voters will speak again and will reshape how we look at the political Romanian spectrum from now on and probably forever.\"\n\n\"The most probable scenario will be a difficult-to-build majority in the parliament to support and endorse a new government,\" he added.\n\nDespite historically being Romania's two main opposition parties that have dominated post-communist politics, the PSD and the PNL formed an unlikely coalition in 2021, which became increasingly strained. A small ethnic Hungarian party exited the Cabinet last year after a power-sharing dispute.\n\nWhile the presidential role in Romania has significant decision-making powers in areas such as national security and foreign policy, the prime minister is the head of the nation's government.\n\nAlexandru Rizescu, a 24-year-old medical student, says he was surprised by the result in the first-round presidential ballot and that it's an \"obvious sign\" Europe at large is shifting toward far-right populism.\n\n\"Most of us are sick of these big parties, but now we have to think about the ... lesser evil,\" he said. \"If Georgescu becomes president, with a favorable parliament, it's going to be wild.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Associated Press reporting confirms that the protest , which took place on Friday, did not amount to a storming of the Capitol or an insurrection.\n\nTHE FACTS: A video clip of a protest at Georgia's state Capitol on Friday circulated widely on social media this week, often with claims exaggerating what happened.\n\nThe 45-second clip showed a Georgia state trooper using a bullhorn to instruct protesters to disperse, citing a state law that allows arrests for disruptive protests at the Capitol. As the officer was speaking, Democratic Georgia Rep. Park Cannon approached him and put her ear up to the bullhorn, blocking it. Another officer moved her away by the arm, telling her to \"step aside.\" Cannon then engaged in an argument with the officers.\n\nSocial media users on Monday likened the protest in the video to the violent siege of the United States Capitol on Jan. 6, which resulted in five deaths and hundreds of arrests.\n\n\"Leftists STORM Georgia Capitol In Response to ID Required for Absentee Ballots,\" conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza wrote in a headline alongside the video, which was viewed more than 69,000 times on the video-sharing website Rumble.\n\nOthers on Twitter called the protest in the video an \"insurrection\" in tweets shared thousands of times.\n\nHowever, the Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed to the AP that the protesters entered the state Capitol lawfully and remained peaceful, unlike the rioters in the violent Jan. 6 insurrection in Washington.\n\n\"No one was arrested,\" Young wrote. \"The protesters were asked to disperse and they left peacefully on their own.\"\n\nAccording to AP reporting , the Friday protest began after Democrats were not given a chance to speak on the House floor against House Bill 531 , which would make multiple changes to restrict voting, including requiring photo ID to cast absentee ballots.\n\nDuring a lunch break, protesters gathered in the atrium of the Capitol. When Cannon put her ear up to a state trooper's bullhorn, another trooper asked her to step aside. Cannon demanded a public apology from the officer and began shouting complaints that quickly evolved into an attack on the voting bills.\n\nCannon then sat down and a group of more than a dozen Democrats, mostly House members, joined her. They remained on the steps for two hours, eating lunch, taking pictures, sending social media messages and leaving an aisle open for traffic.\n\nOn Monday, the Georgia House passed House Bill 531, sending it to the Senate for further debate. Civil rights groups gathered at the Capitol to protest.\n\nAs with Friday's protest, those who gathered on Monday entered the Capitol lawfully and were nonviolent, Young said.\n\n___\n\nThis is part of The Associated Press' ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\n\nHere's more information on Facebook's fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

The individuals in the video entered the Capitol building lawfully and dispersed peacefully, with no violence or arrests, according to Franka Young, a spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Public Safety. Associated Press reporting confirms that the protest , which took place on Friday, did not amount to a storming of the Capitol or an insurrection.\n\nTHE FACTS: A video clip of a protest at Georgia's state Capitol on Friday circulated widely on social media this week, often with claims exaggerating what happened.\n\nThe 45-second clip showed a Georgia state trooper using a bullhorn to instruct protesters to disperse, citing a state law that allows arrests for disruptive protests at the Capitol. As the officer was speaking, Democratic Georgia Rep. Park Cannon approached him and put her ear up to the bullhorn, blocking it. Another officer moved her away by the arm, telling her to \"step aside.\" Cannon then engaged in an argument with the officers.\n\nSocial media users on Monday likened the protest in the video to the violent siege of the United States Capitol on Jan. 6, which resulted in five deaths and hundreds of arrests.\n\n\"Leftists STORM Georgia Capitol In Response to ID Required for Absentee Ballots,\" conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza wrote in a headline alongside the video, which was viewed more than 69,000 times on the video-sharing website Rumble.\n\nOthers on Twitter called the protest in the video an \"insurrection\" in tweets shared thousands of times.\n\nHowever, the Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed to the AP that the protesters entered the state Capitol lawfully and remained peaceful, unlike the rioters in the violent Jan. 6 insurrection in Washington.\n\n\"No one was arrested,\" Young wrote. \"The protesters were asked to disperse and they left peacefully on their own.\"\n\nAccording to AP reporting , the Friday protest began after Democrats were not given a chance to speak on the House floor against House Bill 531 , which would make multiple changes to restrict voting, including requiring photo ID to cast absentee ballots.\n\nDuring a lunch break, protesters gathered in the atrium of the Capitol. When Cannon put her ear up to a state trooper's bullhorn, another trooper asked her to step aside. Cannon demanded a public apology from the officer and began shouting complaints that quickly evolved into an attack on the voting bills.\n\nCannon then sat down and a group of more than a dozen Democrats, mostly House members, joined her. They remained on the steps for two hours, eating lunch, taking pictures, sending social media messages and leaving an aisle open for traffic.\n\nOn Monday, the Georgia House passed House Bill 531, sending it to the Senate for further debate. Civil rights groups gathered at the Capitol to protest.\n\nAs with Friday's protest, those who gathered on Monday entered the Capitol lawfully and were nonviolent, Young said.\n\n___\n\nThis is part of The Associated Press' ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.\n\nHere's more information on Facebook's fact-checking program: https://www.facebook.com/help/1952307158131536\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nPARIS (AP) - Tens of thousands of supporters of leftist parties marched through central Paris on Sunday to express disappointment with President Francois Hollande's first year in power, criticizing the leader for reneging on his promises to rein in the world of finance and enact economic stimulus.\n\nHollande, a Socialist, rose to the presidency last May, promising to spare France the austerity measures imposed elsewhere in Europe. And the French government has largely avoided the deep spending cuts, big tax hikes and the wide-ranging reforms of many of its neighbors.\n\nInstead, it has nibbled around the edges of its deficit, cutting 10 billion euros ($13 billion) in spending and increasing taxes, largely on the rich, by 20 billion euros. That's relatively little for a country with 2 trillion euro economy of which 57 percent is government spending.\n\nStill, France's economy has continued to deteriorate, with growth stagnating and unemployment rising above 10 percent.\n\nLeftists who took the streets on Sunday - largely from parties to the left of Hollande's mainstream Socialist Party - rejected the notion that Hollande had spared France a worse fate.\n\n\"Salaries are frozen. They continue to reduce hiring in the public sector,\" said Brigitte Blang, a 64-year-old teacher from eastern France. \"We're waiting for true leftist policies. There's money in the coffers!\"\n\nBlang was among tens of thousands of people from around the country who gathered around Paris' iconic Place de la Bastille, named for the prison stormed by French revolutionaries in 1789. They carried signs that said, \"Down with austerity,\" ''Out with finance, humans first\" and \"OUSTerity - finance should pay.\"\n\nParis police said 30,000 people showed up, although protest organizers said there were 180,000. After speeches, the crowd marched to another Paris square.\n\nSeveral protesters acknowledged that they voted for Hollande a year ago - either simply to ensure the incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy's defeat or because they had hope for his leadership.\n\nHollande's failure to keep the support of those on the far left protesting in Paris on Sunday while also angering the right -who think his economic reforms and budget cuts haven't gone far enough - has made him one the least popular presidents in modern French history. In a sign of how he is being squeezed from both sides, police said 15,000 people - largely right-leaning - gathered in another part of Paris on Sunday to protest the recent passage of a law legalizing gay marriage.\n\nHollande and his ministers have pleaded for more time to allow their policies to take hold.\n\nOn the one hand, France's reluctance to enact major budget cuts may seem prescient to some as many economists and politicians in Europe rethink the austerity programs demanded in exchange for bailouts. The effects of budget cuts and tax increases have been much more detrimental to growth than some expected, and the prolonged recession and high unemployment in many countries has begun to make those policies untenable.\n\nBut others note that France hasn't just shied away from budget cuts, it has also skimped on reforms. While Spain and Italy may be struggling more than France currently, both countries are also laying the groundwork for a strong, durable recovery, many economists say.\n\nFrance, on the other hand, may be left behind when the rebound comes since it has only partially committed to labor market reforms. Many of its companies are still not competitive on the world stage, its government spending is still too high and Hollande's administration has only exacerbated the impression that France is a difficult place to do business. One of his ministers has had very public spats with Goodyear, ArcelorMittal and Yahoo in the past year.\n\nHollande has been trying to turn that reputation around, recently unveiling a raft of tax cuts for entrepreneurs. But that announcement is a good example of the bind he finds himself in: Those very tax cuts were held up as a call to arms for Sunday's protest. And many deplored what they see as a stranglehold on power exercised by big companies and banks.\n\n\"Our march ... is a protest against the coup d'etat of the world of finance that is happening throughout Europe,\" said Jean-Luc Melenchon, the head of a grouping of leftist political parties known as the Left Front.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "The Left's Self-Defeating Israel Obsession\n\nTaking an extreme position, then demanding total orthodoxy, does no favors for democratic socialism in America.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nAsk most Americans what DSA stands for and they are unlikely to know the Democratic Socialists of America, the country's largest leftist organization, with about 92,000 members. But ask about AOC and they are likely to be familiar with DSA's most famous member: Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Bronx-born socialist firebrand known for her fierce advocacy of trade unions, universal medical care, tuition-free university, migrant rights, and pro-environmental policies. So why did DSA's national leadership recently decide to withdraw its conditional endorsement of her?\n\nFor any sane organization, the 34-year-old lawmaker would be a treasured asset. She is principled, politically talented, and able to make national headlines on a regular basis. Her victory in 2018 led to the most significant single-day membership increase in DSA's history. She has a grassroots background and knows how to talk to ordinary people, but she is also an agile political operator. In the space of a few short years, she rose to the vice ranking position on the House Oversight Committee and made herself a unique place in the Democratic Party.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez has one important failing in the eyes of DSA's leaders: She is not sufficiently anti-Israel. As the organization declared its non-endorsement of her, the only rationale it cited was disapproval of her position on Israel.\n\nRead: Too much purity is bad for the left\n\nNever mind that Ocasio-Cortez was one of the first elected politicians in the United States to advocate for a cease-fire in the current conflict between Israel and Hamas, or that since March, she has called the Israeli operation in Gaza a \"genocide.\" Never mind that she is estimated to be the fifth-most-pro-Palestinian member of the House. None of this is enough for DSA's leadership, which includes a faction openly supportive of Hamas. Ocasio-Cortez has been faulted for endorsing a resolution that affirmed Israel's right to exist; for being open to funding the purely defensive Iron Dome, which has saved thousands of innocent Israeli and Palestinian lives; and for not backing the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign, which is so extreme in its opposition to \"normalization\" that it opposes left-wing Israeli writers as well as the Palestinian Israeli pro-peace and anti-occupation movement Standing Together.\n\nIn fact, some in DSA have condemned Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Bernie Sanders for speaking at Standing Together's national convention. DSA further faulted Ocasio-Cortez for holding a public panel on anti-Semitism last month with the Jewish Council for Public Affairs. There, she engaged Jewish advocates in an admirably nuanced and empathetic conversation that might have appealed to a wide audience. But those in DSA who have asked her to stop \"platforming Zionists\" were not impressed.\n\nFor one of America's best-known democratic socialists to be dropped by its largest leftist organization is parodical enough to be worthy of a Monty Python skit . It has embarrassed many of the more mainstream factions in the organization, which are eager to point out that Ocasio-Cortez maintains the endorsement of DSA's New York City branch, the largest one in the country. These segments of DSA are attempting to control the damage by downplaying the non-endorsement.\n\nBut this isn't a PR gaffe or a misstep. Rather, some DSA leaders have been making the case consistently, for some time, that Ocasio-Cortez has broken the orthodoxy they expect on Israel. An enormous political gap separates Ocasio-Cortez's democratic socialism, which did not prevent her from harshly condemning Hamas's attacks on October 7, from the anti-Israel maximalism common in segments of the left, including factions currently controlling DSA's leadership. For the latter, any recognition of Israel's existence is tantamount to betrayal.\n\nNo other issue comes anywhere close to drawing this much irrational passion on the left. Of all the contentious matters involving the congresswoman-including her 2022 vote on a rail strike and her endorsement of President Joe Biden-only Israel led to this drastic action, which is telling. And hers isn't the only case. Sanders is almost single-handedly responsible for the resurgence of democratic socialism in America, and he is by far the most pro-Palestinian member of the Senate-yet many leftists, including those in DSA, attack him constantly for his opposition to Hamas's terrorism. Representative Jamaal Bowman, a DSA member , recently lost a primary race to a pro-Israel rival. But his vote for the Iron Dome and his visit to Israel had previously led DSA to clash with him too.\n\nThe obsessive anti-Israel maximalism of this section of the American left is bewildering. Domestic concerns long ago superseded internationalism for this group, and it's hard to imagine the same people caring this much about any other foreign-policy issue. What accounts for this?\n\nSome leftists will argue that billions of dollars in U.S. military aid to Israel make the issue particularly pertinent. But the United States has recently given billions more to Ukraine and regularly provides substantial military assistance to Jordan, Egypt, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya, all of which are involved in controversial conflicts. The left didn't abandon Ocasio-Cortez for her positions on aid to Ukraine (she has reliably voted for extending it) or NATO expansion (she's for it), both of which run against the DSA line. And the average American leftist has little to say about the territorial disputes between Somalia and its neighbors, or about Sudan's civil war, despite the considerable role the United States plays in these conflicts.\n\nThis asymmetry doesn't apply only to the left. American supporters of Israel and Palestine across the political spectrum care enough to scrutinize candidates' positions on this foreign-policy issue more than most others. But on the left, the obsession with Israel is accompanied by extremist positions, such as support for Hamas, that many American Jews understandably view as evidence of anti-Semitism.\n\nFor this reason and others, the maximalist litmus test used for Ocasio-Cortez is as ethically bankrupt as it is politically impractical. The left can expect to win significant support for positions such as calling for a cease-fire, conditioning military aid to Israel, sanctioning settlers in the West Bank, and recognizing a Palestinian state. These policies are reasonable, could make a meaningful difference to Palestinians, and even have a chance of appealing to an actual majority. But by censuring the likes of Sanders, Bowman, and Ocasio-Cortez, the maximalists prove that such positions don't satisfy them: They want nothing less than the denial of Israel's right to exist, a nonstarter for most.\n\nThat Israel should be the cause of a major rift among American leftists at this time is striking. The world's richest country badly needs a socialist force that can stand against growing inequality and advocate persuasively for social and environmental justice. Taking loony, extremist positions on this issue is a sure means of self-marginalization.\n\nRead: What left-wing Democrats haven't learned from defeat\n\nPlenty of other roads are available to socialists. When the left-wing New Popular Front topped the votes in French parliamentary elections on July 7, many on the American left cheered. But few seemed to realize that the incredibly broad coalition the French put together last month encompassed parties with starkly divergent positions on Israel-Palestine: The far-left France Unbowed of Jean-Luc Mélenchon, which has embraced an often noxious anti-Zionism, agreed to band together with a wide range of parties, including a socialist party headed by Raphaël Glucksmann , who was previously booed out of a May Day march for his more balanced position on Israel. In the second round of the elections, France's united left was able to win only by getting help from President Emmanuel Macron's centrists, which meant widening the tent even more. The coalition was possible in part because the front's political platform embraced compromise: It calls on France to recognize the State of Palestine and enforce an arms embargo against Israel, but it also loudly denounces Hamas's October 7 attacks as terrorist massacres.\n\nA few months ago, Ocasio-Cortez's team boasted that her goal was to build \"a new Democratic coalition that can consistently draw a majority of American support.\" American socialists must decide whether this is what they want: They can choose to be the party of AOC, and others like her, who wish to build a broad popular front, with an actual chance of coming to power and changing lives both at home and overseas. Or they can opt forever to be a bumper-sticker crowd, uninterested in dealing in the art of the possible. What they can't be is both."

      "text": "Too Much Purity Is Bad for the Left\n\nIf socialists want to be a political force in America, they need to form coalitions, defend democracy, and change real people's lives.\n\nAmerican leftists are facing a question that has become a perennial bugbear. Come November, should they support the Democratic incumbent Joe Biden to defeat Donald Trump? Or, given their profound reservations about both candidates, should they abstain from voting at all?\n\nBiden's support for Israel's brutal war in Gaza has given the conundrum special urgency this year, but the question has become exhaustingly familiar. Four years ago, the country's largest leftist organization, the Democratic Socialists of America, loudly declared that it was not endorsing Biden, despite his backing by a coalition that included Bernie Sanders, Angela Davis, the DSA's own Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, most major trade unions, and, implicitly , The New England Journal of Medicine . When some in the DSA's leadership suggested that the organization could at least call on its members in swing states to consider voting for Biden, the majority voted down the proposal. Biden went on to win without any organized help from the DSA.\n\nAt moments like these, the American left could stand to learn from the experiences of its international counterparts. The international left seems largely to recognize that it is too small to survive on its own and must therefore build coalitions-most important, to ally with those who defend democracy and basic civic rights. And this is true despite the fact that the left in countries such as France, India, and Japan is a formidable force, boasting organizations with millions of members and sending delegates to serve in legislative and executive office. American leftists, meanwhile, have spent decades mired in niche subcultures of activist groups-they are marginal and yet still spurn coalitions that risk adulterating their purity.\n\nHelen Lewis: The left can't afford to go mad\n\nThe United States is relatively rare among democracies in that it has long lacked a far-left party with legislative representation, a distinction that has something to do with the peculiarities of its political system. In most parliamentary democracies, political parties are membership-based and ideologically aligned, whereas in the United States, they are loose coalitions that can encompass a wide range of views.\n\nThis protean structure didn't stop American social movements from achieving important milestones throughout the 20th century-among them, female suffrage, workers' rights, and an end to segregation. To get there, rights campaigns often had to fight both the Democratic and the Republican establishments. But they managed to mobilize masses, carve out new political spaces, and ultimately make the journey from protest to politics .\n\nBayard Rustin explained the relationship between movement and party in 1965: \"Southern demonstrators had recognized that the most effective way to strike at the police brutality they suffered from was by getting rid of the local sheriff-and that meant political action, which in turn meant, and still means, political action within the Democratic party where the only meaningful primary contests in the South are fought.\"\n\nAmerica's youth-led social-protest movements petered out by the end of the 1970s, however, and the left came to place itself outside the political system, condemning itself to marginality. American leftist activists continued to bring some changes through trade unions, civil-rights organizations, and feminist groups, but they did not coalesce into an organized political movement until 2016, when a democratic socialist senator from Vermont took the step of running in the Democratic primaries. In doing so, Bernie Sanders helped the minuscule DSA grow its membership from 6,200 in 2015 to a peak of 95,000 in 2021 (it now stands at about 78,000).\n\nThe DSA is a tiny force in a country of 332 million. And it is less a nationwide political organization than a federation of local activist groups that share a banner despite the wildly divergent politics of their members. The DSA's elected representatives reliably showed up for Biden in 2020 and have voted for measures such as support for NATO's enlargement. The national political leadership of the organization, however, has taken diametrically opposed positions. The organization lacks a united political program even on such basic matters as whom to endorse for president.\n\nMany in the DSA good-heartedly argue that what matters is grassroots, and in many cases local, activism, not who gets elected to Congress or the White House. In this sense, the DSA seems more comfortable with the pre-Bernie activism of bumper stickers and single-cause groups than with the prospect of building a cohesive political force.\n\nThe international left, by contrast, has both a history of cohesion and the baggage to go along with it. Many leftists are still struggling to transcend the legacy of the 20th century's authoritarian socialism. Some once-powerful parties of the left have simply disappeared into thin air (as in Italy). New leftist parties, such as Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain, emerged or drew strength from the wreckage of the 2008 global economic recession but didn't achieve as much as optimists had hoped. Still, socialist parties on multiple continents are major political actors in ways that their American counterparts simply are not, and the reason is at least in part their willingness to forge pragmatic alliances.\n\nThis imperative is taken as elementary in much of the world. India's communist parties have worked within the country's multiparty democratic structures since its independence in 1947 and have thus also remained relevant in the post-Soviet era. Last year, they came together with the Indian National Congress and a range of left, center-left, centrist, regionalist, and even center-right parties to form the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA). Their aim was to present a united front against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, whose chauvinism and authoritarianism have had a chilling effect on the world's biggest democracy. Pointing to the threat such forces pose to \"the ethos of the country,\" Annie Raja, the leader of the Communist Party of India, told a local publication, \"At such a juncture, any party which is sincerely wishing to save this country and democracy and secularism must try to unite.\"\n\nSimilarly, the Turkish left, including the Workers Party and several other Marxist groups, campaigned last year for the centrist presidential candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu, whom it viewed as having the best chance to beat the authoritarian President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Although Erdoğan still won, the left's campaign gave it new national visibility and its largest parliamentary representation in decades.\n\nIn Israel, a left-wing coalition with Arab and Jewish members decided to join Zionist parties of the left and the center in endorsing the centrist Benny Gantz for prime minister, with a goal of ousting Benjamin Netanyahu, seen by the group as a menace to Israel's democracy.\n\nIn countries where democracy itself is not under threat, leftists have learned to make broad alliances in order to remain politically relevant. In Portuguese elections on March 10, the Communist Party, the Left Bloc, and the left-leaning green parties gained about 13 percent of the vote among them. They will now do all they can to exclude far-right and even center-right forces from forming a government. In other words, they are likely to support the center-left Socialist Party, roughly the Portuguese equivalent to Biden's party. That party's leader, Pedro Nuno Santos, helped coordinate the support of communists and the Left Bloc for a previous government in 2015-19.\n\nSimilarly, in Spain the Communist Party and Podemos are part of a coalition cabinet led by the center-left Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. One of that country's most popular politicians is the communist deputy prime minister and labor minister, Yolanda Diaz, who has vocally backed the Palestinian cause and was recently in Washington to work with her American counterpart on new regulations protecting workers from artificial-intelligence algorithms.\n\nOne can criticize the left for joining governments in Spain and Portugal, but not without acknowledging that the policies these governments have adopted have already changed millions of lives. Spain has passed gender-equality laws that improve transgender rights, offer state-funded paid leave for women who suffer from painful periods (a first among European countries), and mandate greater parity for women in politics and the public sphere. Portugal reversed austerity measures that had included deep cuts to wages, pensions, and social security; The New York Times termed the result a \" major revival .\" Whatever soul-searching the American left wants to do about its conception of socialism, if it seeks to be a serious political force, it must also attempt to win elections, come to power, and change real people's lives.\n\nOn a subnational level, too, leftists outside the United States have put sloganeering aside to pursue concrete goals in office and show what their ideals can look like in real life. In India's Kerala, a democratically elected communist-led government has made particular strides in human development, poverty reduction, public education, and, most recently, public health; the international news media lauded K. K. Shailaja, Kerala's health minister, for her handling of the coronavirus pandemic, even though the state later faced a new wave of the virus.\n\nConor Friedersdorf: How October 7 changed America's free-speech culture\n\nCloser to home, Chile's President Gabriel Boric, who was actually endorsed by the DSA, leads a pioneering left-wing government. Patient political work and broad alliances propelled him to the Mint Palace. Former President Michelle Bachelet, from the country's center-left, supported Boric in 2021, as did an even more liberal predecessor, Ricardo Lagos. That did not stop the Communist Party from enthusiastically joining his government, and Camilla Vallejo, once a fellow leader of the student movement, now serves as a cabinet minister. Under the leadership of its first-ever communist mayor, Irací Hassler, the capital city of Santiago has taken steps to bolster women's rights by offering support to victims of domestic violence, for instance, while battling food insecurity and publicly condemning discrimination against migrants.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the United States actually had a powerful leftist force in the form of the Socialist Party of America. Its members won municipal races in places such as Berkeley, California, and Schenectady, New York. The party's proud centerpiece was Milwaukee, which had three socialist mayors for a total of 38 years from 1910 to 1960. Those further to the left often made fun of them as \"sewer socialists\" who cared more about the city's excellent public-sanitation system than about the socialist revolution (like all good leftist insults, this one had originated as an internal jab within the party).\n\nBut Milwaukee's sewer socialists could boast something that purists simply can't: They made a difference in the lives of millions of working people. Those are the politics-result-oriented and pragmatic-that convince people to give the socialist left and its ideas a chance. If American socialists truly want to emerge as a serious political force in the world's most powerful country, they need to stop cosplaying radicalism and learn how to defend democracy, build broad coalitions, and run successful governments."

      "text": "Why Can't the Left Win?\n\nAdvice and constructive criticism from observers who believe that America would benefit from a healthier opposition to the governing coalition\n\nPresident Trump wields great power. Those who believe him to be a cruel, dishonest man who is glaringly unqualified to preside over the executive branch or U.S. foreign policy, should welcome challenges from the left, right, and center to his administration.\n\nBut is the American left capable of political success right now?\n\nIts recent win-loss record is poor, whether one begins with the Seattle WTO protests, the anti-war marches of 2003, the push for immigration reform, Occupy Wall Street, or Black Lives Matter. And observing the left during the first 100 days of the Trump administration, I am beginning to despair that its pathologies are growing in strength at the very moment when the worst of the right is ascendant, too.\n\nI am not a Leftist. But I want a country where the best versions of left and right are vying against one another-and one where overdue reforms are made to the immigration, finance, and criminal-justice systems. I believe constructive criticism can improve any coalition. And such criticism is on offer from leftists, liberals, conservatives, and others who believe that a healthy left has something vital to offer America.\n\nWhat follows is a roundup of critiques offered in that spirit. It is neither exhaustive nor definitive. But I hope that it can serve a starting point for an informative conversation.\n\nThe Limits of Opprobrium and Stigma\n\nWhen Abraham Lincoln was 33 years old, he gave a speech inside a Presbyterian church to a temperance society. His message: The assembled ought to be nicer to drinkers and sellers of alcohol, rather than shunning them, or denouncing them as moral pestilences. Indeed, they ought to use \"kindly persuasion,\" even if a man's drunkenness had caused misery to his wife, or left his children hungry and naked with want.\n\nFor people are never less likely to change, to convert to new ways of thinking or acting, than when it means joining the ranks of their denouncers.\n\nTo expect otherwise, \"to have expected them not to meet denunciation with denunciation ... and anathema with anathema, was to expect a reversal of human nature,\" Lincoln explained. \"If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart, which, say what he will, is the great highroad to his reason, and when once gained, you will find but little trouble in convincing his judgment of the justice of your cause.\"\n\nHowever, Lincoln cautioned, dictate to a man's judgment, command his action, or mark him to be despised, \"and he will retreat within himself, close all the avenues to his head and his heart. And even though your cause be naked truth itself, transformed to the heaviest lance, harder than steel, and sharper than steel can be made, and though you throw it with more than Herculean force and precision, you shall be no more be able to pierce him, than to penetrate the hard shell of a tortoise with a rye straw.\"\n\nIt was and remains extremely counterproductive for the left to treat Trump supporters as a \"basket of deplorables,\" especially given how tiny a percentage of his followers would need to be converted away from the president to reorient political power in Washington, D.C. For directing me to a Lincoln speech I'd never read before, I thank Andrew Sullivan, who quoted it to support the argument that \"you will not arrest the reactionary momentum by ignoring it or dismissing it entirely as a function of bigotry or stupidity. You'll only defuse it by appreciating its insights and co-opting its appeal.\"\n\nForget What Is \"Normal\"\n\nA typical objection to calls to contest reactionary premises on the merits, and to persuade adherents of reaction, is that doing so somehow validates their ideas. \"Among many liberals, there is an understandable impulse to raise the drawbridge, to deny certain ideas access to respectable conversation, to prevent certain concepts from being 'normalized,'\" Sullivan wrote, anticipating the objection. \"But the normalization has already occurred - thanks, largely, to voters across the West - and willfully blinding ourselves to the most potent political movement of the moment will not make it go away. Our job in these circumstances is not to condescend but to engage - or forfeit the politics of the moment (and the future) to reaction.\"\n\nNoah Millman has fleshed out why the posture of preventing normalization is doomed:\n\nWhoever says that Trump shouldn't be \"normalized\" is implying that somebody - the press, perhaps? - is in a position to decide what is normal, and to inform everybody else of that fact. But that's not how norms work, and neither the press nor anybody else is in a position either to grant or withhold recognition to the new government.\n\nIn fact, the word is a way of distracting from one of the crucial jobs at hand. Trump, for example, is on strong legal ground when he says that he is exempt from conflict of interest laws. But laws can be changed - and perhaps they should be. To achieve that requires making a case, not that what Trump is doing isn't \"normal,\" but that it is a bad thing worth prohibiting by law. Saying \"we mustn't normalize this behavior\" rather than \"we need to stop this behavior\" is really a way of saying that you don't want to engage in politics, but would rather just signal to those who already agree with us just how appalled we are. And haven't we learned already the dire consequences of substituting virtue signaling for politics?\n\nMatt Yglesias has reached similar conclusions .\"Normalization, in this context, is typically cast as a form of complicity with Trump in which the highest possible premium is placed on maintaining a rigid state of alert and warning people that he is not just another politician whom you may or may not agree with on the issues,\" he wrote. \"But several students of authoritarian populist movements abroad have a different message. To beat Trump, his opponents need to practice ordinary humdrum politics.\"\n\nSo far, too few are doing so.\n\nStop Rejecting the Ordinary Work of Politics\n\nReflecting on what he called \"the woke identity,\" Freddie DeBoer observed a tendency among some leftists to forcefully reject the work of persuasion with excuses like, \"It's not my job to educate you.\" The not-yet-woke are to be chided, not engaged.\n\n\"The problem with making your political program the assembly of a moral aristocracy is that hierarchy always requires exclusivity,\" DeBoer argues. \"A fundamental, structural impediment to liberal political victory is that their preferred kind of moral engagement necessarily limits the number of adherents they can win. It's just math: you can't grow a mass party when the daily operation of your movement involves finding more and more heretics to ostracize from the community.\"\n\nHe adds that \"political progress is always and only about pulling the edge cases into a particular orbit and hoping that in time they will come to circle closer and closer to your goals.\"\n\nHe therefore rejects \"the performative uselessness that is the call out.\"\n\nCall Out Hate, Not Faux Pas\n\nA related concern was raised by Ezra Klein and Chris Hayes in a podcast conversation where they agreed that while objecting to racism or other bigotries is important-as deBoer would agree-the left must take care, as the universe of things deemed problematic continues to expand, that it doesn't stray into enforcing elite manners against people who mean no harm and harbor no hate when violating them. What's more, it must be better at clarifying why some of what may strike observers as mere elite manners is, in fact, a substantive good that deserves to be emphasized.\n\nAs they put it:\n\nHayes: Issues of social justice have been understood by large parts of the populace as essentially elite manners.\n\nKlein: Which, they sometimes have that dimension.\n\nHayes: Those two things are bound together. So if you watch a farce, the person at the dinner party who doesn't know which fork to use, that's who you root for. And in our politics a huge part of the population has understood what I think are--what are--genuine struggles for social justice and equality as essentially elite manners. Michelle Goldberg makes this great point. And it was my experience as well. She was like, 'When I would go to rallies, a lot of people told me about political correctness and almost no one told me about NAFTA.' It was the violations of the taboos that people liked, at least the hard core supporters who would go to the rallies, more than trade. Because at some level, their understanding of it, it was the person at the dinner party with everyone with their fine china and their 9 different kinds of forks just drinking the soup out of the bowl. And it was like, that's my dude.\n\nAnd precisely for the reasons you identify.\n\nPrecisely because there's been this way in which the cosmopolitan elites, the guardians of culture, the people that cluster in these urban centers, have a set of social values and social taboos that I think are informed by genuine commitments toward justice, but also have this aspect of elite manners and that are understood by huge parts of society as elite manners.\n\nIndeed, there is widespread frustration, even among leftists clustered in those urban areas, about the degree to which ephemeral changes in elite manners are policed.\n\nMake Organizing About Effectiveness and Winning\n\nLast summer, DeRay Mckesson, the civil-rights activist best known for his work with Black Lives Matter, worried that \"there is a noticeable absence of grace in the movement space,\" that \"some people are more addicted to fighting than winning,\" and that the personal backgrounds of organizers are too often treated as if they are a proxy for their effectiveness. \"We have started to police people's authenticity by their proximity to trauma, not their proximity to the work,\" he said. \"Both my parents were drug addicts. My father raised us. My mother left. I know what it's like to sleep on the floor when they shoot too close to the house. That doesn't make me a better organizer. It could actually just make me more traumatized. How do we stop thinking about proximity to trauma as the thing that makes you the best organizer?\"\n\nImplicit in that formulation is the notion that the best organizing is that which achieves ends in the real world, not that which most defers to or elevates the traumatized.\n\nThe year before, Randall Kennedy, the eminent Harvard Law School professor, argued in a sprawling Harper's magazine essay that while \"the politics of respectability has occasionally inflicted deep wounds on the black community\" and is often misguided, \"these misapplications of respectability politics should not obscure an essential fact: any marginalized group should be attentive to how it is perceived.\" In Kennedy's view, \"the politics of respectability is a tactic of public relations that is, per se, neither necessarily good nor bad. A sound assessment of its deployment in a given instance depends on its goals, the manner in which it is practiced, and the context within which a given struggle is waged. Its association with esteemed figures and episodes in African-American history suggests that the politics of respectability warrants a more respectful hearing than it has recently received.\"\n\nHe proceeds to facilitate that hearing, harkening back to specific civil-rights era victories, warning against \"forcing a Manichaean choice between outward-facing protest and inward-facing character building,\" and concluding that \"by dint of intelligent, brave, persistent collective action, African Americans have helped tremendously to transform the United States in ways that offer grounds for encouragement and hope. Indeed, the tone of indignant futility struck by some opponents of black respectability politics is worrying. The politics of black respectability has not banished antiblack racism, but it has improved the racial situation dramatically and has kept alive some black people who might otherwise be dead.\"\n\nThese two voices might well disagree on the most effective tactics for the left, but both expressed frustration at the impulse to make winning subservient to other concerns.\n\nParticipate in Local Politics\n\nFifteen years ago, when I was a student, undergraduates at the Claremont Colleges were upset about abusive policing. As I recalled in a recent Los Angeles Times column, \"In the spring of 1999, Irvin Landrum Jr., an 18-year-old black man, was shot and killed during a traffic stop. The officers who shot him said they recovered a gun, but it was last registered to the police chief in a neighboring municipality. Calls for an independent investigation into the shooting, and for reforms to policing in Claremont and beyond, were the biggest activist causes during my years on campus.\"\n\nToday, Claremont students still care about abusive policing. \"But there is no major movement to transform the Claremont City Council or police department,\" I observed. \"Students most recently attracted media attention for mobilizing against an individual whose politics they dislike: They shut down a speech by Heather Mac Donald, a Manhattan Institute scholar who studies policing and has criticized Black Lives Matter. But even if Mac Donald never speaks in public again, police departments will continue to use excessive force. There's no plausible cause and effect I can discern.\"\n\nSuch is the norm at lots of colleges: Student activists focus on campus events rather than local politics. As Robert J. Smith and Whitney Tymas explained on election night, however, the left made important gains in criminal-justice reform at the local level. And there is no reason why focused reformers cannot achieve much, much more:\n\n﻿ While significant advances in climate change and immigration reform require congressional action, criminal-justice reform is an entirely different beast. The center of gravity for meaningful reform tends to be local. Should police officers use stop and frisk tactics? Conduct invasive raids of homes while investigating nonviolent offenses? Use military style vehicles? Those are decisions made by individual police departments or city councils, and are influenced by community advocates. Should prosecutors ask for bail, and how much? Prosecute nonviolent drug possession cases? Prosecute homelessness related offenses, such as sit-sleep-lie bans? Transfer juveniles to adult court? Seek the death penalty?\n\nFor those decisions, too, local politics matter ... Roughly 50 million people live in just 15 of the counties that Clinton won this week. Some of these counties voted for Clinton by a margin of 2-1. If disheartened citizens and advocates chose to refocus their resources and attention to pushing reforms in these places, they could quickly see significant gains in the battle to end mass incarceration and help secure relief for millions of Americans.\n\nThe Perils of Privilege\n\nThat's the title of Phoebe Maltz Bovy's nuanced, book-length deconstruction of the privilege framework , especially when it operates in its accusatory form, rather than its original sense. Written prior to the 2016 election, its afterword comments on Trump's rise.\n\nWhat if Trump's appeal isn't (just) that he gives the impression of caring about overlooked communities in Appalachia, but that he confers victimhood status to great swaths of the population who aren't actually victims? Trumpism isn't about weaving poor and working-class white men back into discussions of socioeconomic inequality. It's about declaring whiteness and maleness forms of marginalization .\n\nWhy might that be attractive to a large group of voters?\n\nOne answer is illuminated earlier in the book. Built into the privilege framework is \"the idea that the normal state of affairs is for things to be going terribly,\" Maltz Bovy writes:\n\nIt can seem as if the desired goal is for everyone to be oppressed, rather than for all to be free from oppression. Is it a problem that white killers are captured alive by the police? That white drug addicts appear in the media as real people with a medical condition? Or is the problem that black killers and drug addicts, respectively, don't get that treatment? It seems right to use 'privilege's your point is that some people do indeed have it too easy.\n\nThat is, after all, what 'privilege' implies.\n\nWhich is why it's such an odd fit for cases where the point being made is that the world is just for some and unjust for others. Calling justice \"privilege\" is just another way of highlighting that not all experience it. The problem is that it also implies that no one should... The privilege framing, with its focus on unearned advantage rather than unjust disadvantage , doesn't fit with situations where even the \"privileged\" person is still quite screwed.\n\nInsofar as the left was operating within the accusatory privilege framework circa 2015 and 2016, it ceded this advantage to Trump: It seemed to imply  a zero-sum view of the world (giving a home-field advantage for a politician like Trump), forcing a choice between pursuing social justice for minorities and improving the lot of the white working class. And it ceded that advantage for nothing, for as Maltz Bovy points out in her conclusion, there is no reason one must describe society in terms of privilege in order to \"acknowledge the unique struggles of those facing more than one form of systemic discrimination.\" There are myriad ways of addressing injustice that don't end up \"inaccurately categorizing huge swaths of humanity under the haves umbrella.\"\n\nWhat Other Critiques Should the Left Consider?\n\nI've yet to present the ideas of Richard Rorty-expect them in a forthcoming article. Have readers encountered other critiques the left should at least consider as it attempts to regroup and achieve some sort of victory in a country where Trump is president?

      "text": "Will the Left Go Too Far?\n\nFor the third time in a century, leftists are driving the Democratic Party's agenda. Will they succeed in making America more equitable, or overplay their hand?\n\nIf you gauge the climate inside the Democratic Party merely by which candidates won its 2018 primaries, you might think reports of its leftward lurch are exaggerated. Despite the hoopla about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's and Ayanna Pressley's upset victories in congressional races in New York and Massachusetts, not a single incumbent Democratic governor or senator lost a primary to a left-leaning challenger.\n\nBut who wins an election is often less important than who sets the agenda. And ideologically, the Democratic Party has veered so sharply that \"establishment\" or \"centrist\" Democrats now frequently support larger expansions of government, and more vehemently scorn Big Business and Big Finance, than most liberal Democrats did a few years ago. In 2016, Hillary Clinton said a single-payer health-care system \"will never, ever come to pass.\" In 2017, West Virginia's Joe Manchin, by some measures the most conservative Democrat in the Senate, said the idea \"should be explored.\" During the 2013-14 election cycle, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey received more money from Wall Street than any other member of Congress. This February, he announced that he would no longer accept donations from corporate political-action committees.\n\nFor the first time in more than 40 years, the left is shaping the Democratic Party's identity. At a time when the terms liberal , progressive , and leftist are often used interchangeably, it's worth clarifying what these terms mean. In America, what distinguishes leftists from liberals and progressives-as well as conservatives-is their commitment to radical equality. Leftists are more likely than liberals to argue that economic inequality renders America's constitutional liberties hollow. They're more likely to look abroad-to the Soviet Union or Cuba in past eras, and to Scandinavia today-for alternatives to America's political and economic models. They're more skeptical of credentialed experts who define the limits of acceptable change. And, perhaps most important, they're more willing to challenge entrenched norms of fair play to forge a more equal country.\n\nBy this definition, the left has rarely wielded much influence inside the Democratic Party. Only twice before has it secured enough power to compel Democrats to co-opt its ideas. In both cases-in the mid-1930s and the mid-1960s-the left gained that power through mass movements that threatened public order. To maintain that order, and forestall more radical alternatives, Democrats passed laws that made America markedly more equal. But the very threat of radicalism and chaos that empowered the left eventually provoked a crushing backlash. Today, for the third time in a century, the left is mobilizing, the Democratic Party is responding, and the threat of disorder is growing. How Democrats respond to that threat will help determine whether the coming years prove to be a third great era of leftist change.\n\nIn both the '30s and the '60s, the left first grew outside the Democratic Party or on its fringes. Franklin D. Roosevelt did not take office promising a radically more equal America. He simply experimented with policies to lift the country out of the Depression. Some of those policies leaned left: The 1933 National Industrial Recovery Act, for instance, regulated industry and protected workers' right to organize. But in his first year in office, Roosevelt also cut government spending by $500 million and fortified, rather than nationalized, America's financial system.\n\nWhat transformed Roosevelt's agenda was pressure from populist movements making leftist economic demands. By the mid-'30s, Father Charles Coughlin hosted what might have been the most popular radio show in the world. His National Union for Social Justice, which the radio priest claimed in 1935 had 8.5 million members, demanded labor rights, easy credit, and the nationalization of banks and industries. When the president tried to balance the budget and stabilize private banks, Coughlin denounced him for having \"out-Hoovered Hoover.\"\n\nFor its part, Huey Long's Share Our Wealth Society, which claimed 5 million members within a year of its founding, advocated seizing private fortunes and using the money to write every American family a $5,000 check. By cutting government spending, the senator from Louisiana fumed, Roosevelt had sold out to \"Mr. Morgan\" and \"Mr. Rockefeller.\"\n\nIf that wasn't enough, 2 million Americans joined Townsend Clubs-named for Francis Everett Townsend, a California doctor spurred to action by the sight of elderly women foraging through the garbage for food-which demanded that the federal government pay $200 a month to every American over the age of 60. Labor unions, invigorated by the protections in the National Industrial Recovery Act and radicalized by communist participation, expanded their power as well. From 1933 to 1935, the United Mine Workers increased its membership by a factor of four and its bank account by a factor of eight. The number of Americans who went on strike doubled from 1932 to 1933, and then rose again in 1934.\n\nBy the end of his first term, Roosevelt was scared-both that these movements would threaten his reelection and that they might foment revolution. The president, wrote his confidant Harold Ickes in September 1934, must \"move further to the left in order to hold the country ... [A] breakdown on the part of the Administration would result in an extreme radical movement.\" In 1935, when followers of Coughlin, Long, and Townsend discussed creating a third party, Roosevelt called their collaboration \"a dangerous situation.\" A secret poll commissioned that year by Democratic Committee Chairman James Farley showed that if Long launched a third-party bid, he could win about 10 percent of the vote and hand the presidency to a Republican.\n\nSo Roosevelt embraced a more radical agenda. In April 1935, he signed the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act, which, at almost $5 billion, cost more than all the revenue the federal government had received in 1934. In July, he signed the pro-labor Wagner Act. In August, he hiked taxes on the wealthy and, in a bid to preempt Townsend's and Long's more ambitious retirement schemes, he created Social Security for the elderly, along with unemployment insurance and aid for low-income families.\n\nRoosevelt didn't co-opt only the left's agenda; he also co-opted its language. Whereas he had once depicted himself as an impartial arbiter between business and labor, he ran for reelection as a proud antagonist of the oppressive rich. \"We have earned,\" he boasted in his 1936 State of the Union address, \"the hatred of entrenched greed.\"\n\nBut even after winning reelection in a landslide, Roosevelt faced another obstacle: the Supreme Court, which struck down the National Industrial Recovery Act and laid the foundation for striking down Social Security. Pressured and emboldened by the militant left, the president responded by proposing that he add justices to the Supreme Court, to give it a pro-New Deal majority. The move violated long-established norms about the relationship between the executive and the judiciary. Roosevelt's opponents warned of tyranny and defeated his gambit in Congress. But the president carried the day. In 1937 the Supreme Court reversed itself. The New Deal survived, and America became-for white men at least-a far more equal country.\n\nThe second American left-the left of the 1960s-also began outside the Democratic Party. And it, too, used the threat of disorder to force initially cautious presidents to propose fundamental change.\n\nAs Julian E. Zelizer details in his book The Fierce Urgency of Now , John F. Kennedy didn't come to the presidency intending to champion racial equality. He didn't meet with Martin Luther King Jr. in the White House until nine months into his term, and then only in secret. When King asked him to push civil-rights legislation, Kennedy-who had made tax cuts his top legislative priority-told him that such legislation didn't have congressional support.\n\nBut civil-rights activists kept provoking showdowns that exposed segregation's brutality and raised the specter of ever-greater chaos if Kennedy did not act. In May 1963, Bull Connor and the Birmingham, Alabama, police responded to King's Project C-for \"confrontation\"-by turning dogs and fire hoses on black children in full view of the national press. Racists firebombed King's brother's home; riots broke out in Birmingham's black neighborhoods. Further delay in Washington, King insisted, would mean deadlier confrontations. In June, when Kennedy finally went on television to demand laws banning segregation in public accommodations, he warned, \"The fires of frustration and discord are burning in every city, North and South, where legal remedies are not at hand. Redress is sought in the streets, in demonstrations, parades, and protests, which create tensions and threaten violence.\"\n\nAfter Kennedy's death, the promise of further disorder prodded Lyndon B. Johnson to pressure a recalcitrant Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act. To overcome a filibuster, he needed the support of the Senate minority leader, the Republican Everett Dirksen. He got it not long after the Congress of Racial Equality threatened to picket Dirksen's house. After the passage of the civil-rights bill, King pressured Johnson on voting rights, warning him that if he stalled, \"you'll see demonstrations on a level you have never seen before.\" Fear of unrest also influenced Johnson's decision to launch the Great Society, which included federal aid for education, food stamps, job training, Head Start, Medicare, Medicaid, and a domestic analogue to the Peace Corps. As Johnson said after riots in Harlem in 1964, \"They've got no jobs. They can't do anything. They're just raising hell.\"\n\nCivil-rights activism wasn't the only reason for the blizzard of left-leaning policies in the mid-1960s. Johnson-who as a young man had worked as a New Deal administrator-was a master legislator obsessed with matching Roosevelt's accomplishments. Still, as Eli Zaretsky argues in his book Why America Needs a Left , neither of Washington's two great 20th-century efforts to legislate equality would have been possible had the American left not mobilized to demand them. Which makes it so significant that it is mobilizing again today.\n\nCornel West has called the four decades after the end of the civil-rights and anti-Vietnam War movements a leftist \"ice age.\" The left produced episodic activist surges: the nuclear-freeze and anti-apartheid movements of the '80s, as well as demonstrations against the World Trade Organization in the late '90s, against the Iraq War in 2003, and for immigration reform in 2006. But none compared with the variety and scale of protest that started in 2011.\n\nIt began with Occupy, which was fueled by young people devastated by the financial crisis. Then, in 2012, undocumented immigrants launched hunger strikes at Barack Obama's reelection-campaign offices and fast-food workers went on strike for a $15 minimum wage. The acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin in 2013 launched Black Lives Matter. In 2016, America saw the largest American Indian protests in a century and one of the largest prison strikes ever.\n\nThe movements were too distant from the political process to pressure Obama the way their predecessors had pressured Roosevelt and Johnson. But they revealed the energy to his left. And in Obama's shadow, a new Democratic Party-reminiscent of Roosevelt in its willingness to embrace class conflict and reminiscent of Johnson in the scope of its Big Government ambition-began taking shape.\n\nIn 2015, lacking a large staff or much institutional support from the Democratic Party, Bernie Sanders leaned on the organizing networks Occupy had built. \"Our fingers are all over this,\" declared one Occupy veteran turned Sanders organizer. After an initially rocky relationship with Black Lives Matter activists, Sanders embraced much of the group's agenda and language. His campaign became a funnel through which the activist left entered the Democratic Party's mainstream. And the process has only accelerated since the election of Donald Trump.\n\nThe activist left has remade the Democratic Party in several ways. First, it has pushed Democrats, who in the Bill Clinton and Obama eras sought the approval and support of corporate and Wall Street titans, to treat monied interests as adversaries. In 2008, Obama raised more cash from the financial, insurance, and real-estate industries than his Republican opponent, John McCain, did. Once in office, he named former investment bankers to serve as three of his first four chiefs of staff. For today's Democrats, by contrast, Wall Street and corporate are generally terms of abuse. Sanders is fond of quoting Roosevelt's description of the ultrarich as \"economic royalists.\" In 2016, according to Adam Bozzi of the group End Citizens United, only three of the 41 Democratic challengers in the nation's most competitive House races rejected money from corporate pac s. This year, 45 of the 73 most competitive challengers did. Most of the Democratic senators likely to seek the presidency in 2020 have pledged to do the same.\n\nThe Democrats aren't just changing their rhetoric and campaign-finance model. They are embracing Big Government policies dismissed as utopian or irresponsible only a year or two ago. During the 2016 campaign, Hillary Clinton criticized Sanders's plan for making tuition free at public colleges. By January 2017, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo-long known as an ally of Wall Street and a critic of excessive government spending-was onstage with Sanders announcing that New York would institute its own free-college plan. In the spring of 2018, Booker-once considered so centrist that in 2013 The Atlantic published an article titled \"Why Do Liberals Hate Cory Booker?\"-introduced legislation to help localities with high unemployment rates offer guaranteed federal jobs, an expansion of government so dramatic that even Sanders had not proposed it during his campaign.\n\nOne reason for this shift is the growing influence that activists now enjoy within the party. Veterans of the 2017 Women's March helped start many of the grassroots groups that supported Democratic candidates in this year's midterm elections. Students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School have responded to the February massacre at their school not just by rallying for gun control. They have fanned out across the country trying to defeat politicians backed by the National Rifle Association.\n\nIn ways that would have been hard to imagine in the Clinton and Obama eras, Democratic politicians are themselves crossing back and forth between participation in the political system and agitation outside it. Ocasio-Cortez, a veteran of the Sanders campaign, decided to run for office after participating in protests against an oil pipeline at the Standing Rock reservation in the Dakotas, then left the campaign trail the weekend before the primary election to protest family separation at the Mexican border. In 2016, the Detroit Economic Club expelled Rashida Tlaib for heckling a speech by Trump. This year she won the Democratic primary to represent parts of Detroit and its suburbs in Congress. Democrats are even protesting inside Congress itself. During Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, Booker publicly released documents about Kavanaugh that Republicans on the Judiciary Committee had deemed confidential-a move that could have led to his expulsion from the Senate-in what he called an act of \"civil disobedience.\"\n\nWhat will all this mean when Democrats take power? That moment may come soon: As of this writing, in 2020 Republicans will defend 20 Senate seats to the Democrats' 11, a highly unfavorable map for the GOP. If Democrats win the presidency in 2020-obviously a big if -they'll likely win both houses of Congress as well.\n\nIf that happens, and Democrats pursue their newly ambitious agenda, an unstoppable force will confront an immovable object. Unless the Republican Party radically and unexpectedly changes, its thinned ranks in Congress will consist of deeply conservative legislators-the kind who saw even Obama's agenda as a socialist hijacking of the United States. Aiding those members will be the filibuster, which will force Democrats to find 60 Senate votes to pass significant legislation. And if Democrats do somehow enact laws, the most conservative Supreme Court since the 1930s may strike them down.\n\nA lesson of the '30s and '60s is that only pressure from outside Washington can overcome these obstacles. Because the left is more mobilized than it was during the Clinton and Obama years, such pressure is easier to imagine under the next Democratic president.\n\nKavanaugh's confirmation battle shows how mass movements can throw into doubt seemingly inevitable political realities. In early September, Kavanaugh's confirmation looked unstoppable. But Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of attempted rape-in the midst of the #MeToo movement, which has raised the political cost of overlooking a man's sexual misdeeds-almost derailed it.\n\nStill, Republicans (and Joe Manchin) confirmed him. Given the nature of today's Republican Party, leftist mobilization may not be enough. In 1964, Dirksen feared the political consequences of African American activists' picketing his home. Today's GOP leaders might turn such an event into a fund-raising appeal.\n\nThis is where things get dangerous. Facing militant GOP opposition, Obama abided by a series of restraints-based upon custom, not law-that circumscribed his agenda. The next Democratic president is less likely to do so. That's partly because Trump is plowing through so many procedural guardrails. And it's partly because the next Democratic president will likely face much more pressure than Obama did from the activist left.\n\nOne factor that curtailed Obama's ambitions was concern about the budget deficit. The year before his election, Democratic leaders in the House instituted a rule called \"paygo,\" which required that any bill that increased entitlement spending or decreased revenues be offset by corresponding tax hikes or spending cuts. Obama himself insisted that his effort at expanding health-care coverage be \"at least deficit-neutral.\"\n\nBut in the years since, as Democrats have moved left, attitudes inside the party have changed. In 2015, Sanders hired as chief economist for the Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee an academic who believes that federal deficits generally don't matter. Progressive commentators now routinely publish articles with headlines like \"Stop Trying to Be 'Responsible' on the Budget, Democrats\" ( The Washington Post ) and \"Yes, Democrats Are the Party of Fiscal Responsibility. But That Will (and Should) Change\" ( Vox ). Earlier this year, left-leaning politicians and journalists slammed Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for pledging to reinstitute paygo (which House Republican leaders have disregarded) if Democrats retook the House.\n\n\"After what Trump has done,\" predicts Austan Goolsbee, a former head of the Council of Economic Advisers under Obama, \"now when Democrats return and want to do things and the policy people say, 'We need to add up how much these cost and to make sure the details work,' they will say, 'Wait, Republicans didn't follow rules. Why should we?' \"\n\nThe deficit is only one of the constraints Democrats might breach. Another is the filibuster. To pass legislation through the Senate, both Democrats and Republicans have used a maneuver known as \"reconciliation,\" which requires only a simple majority. But Senate rules, as interpreted by the body's nonpartisan parliamentarian, make it difficult to use reconciliation for most major legislation.\n\nThat will leave future Democrats with a choice. They can limit their ambitions to whatever Republicans won't block. They can dramatically expand the use of reconciliation, which might require replacing the Senate parliamentarian. Or they can make it harder-or even impossible-to filibuster legislation. These latter steps would not violate the law. But they would enrage Republicans and fuel the sense that, post-Trump, anything goes.\n\nFinally, and most radically, Democrats could follow Roosevelt's example and try to pack a recalcitrant Supreme Court. The idea, which Democrats barely discussed before Trump's election, is gaining steam. In recent months, writers for The Washington Post , Vox , The Intercept , the Los Angeles Times , The New Republic , and The American Prospect have either endorsed it or declared it worthy of serious debate.\n\nAdvocates for overturning the filibuster and packing the Supreme Court argue that both institutions flout the popular will. Republican senators disproportionately hail from less populous states. Four of the five conservative justices were appointed by Republican presidents who'd lost the popular vote. As an article in the influential socialist journal Jacobin recently argued, \"Sometimes you have to break the rules to create a more democratic system.\"\n\nIn the short term, this strategy could work. Legal historians debate how much Roosevelt's court-packing plan contributed to the Supreme Court's decision to reverse itself and uphold the New Deal. But Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes clearly worried that \"increasing outside criticism\" threatened the Court's legitimacy. If the left can mount sufficient pressure in the future, the current chief justice, John Roberts, whose fears for the Court's reputation may already have contributed to his refusal to strike down the Affordable Care Act, might bend too.\n\nBut another lesson of the 1930s and the 1960s is that threatening entrenched norms and disrupting public order-although effective for a while-can eventually provoke a fierce backlash. After the Supreme Court reversed course in 1937, the wave of strikes that had begun late in Roosevelt's first term didn't ease. It grew. That summer, clashes between strikers and the police became so violent in some cities that the governors of Pennsylvania and Ohio imposed martial law. Alarmed that the president's victories were emboldening rather than placating the militant left, conservatives-including in Roosevelt's own party-counterattacked. The House Un-American Activities Committee launched hearings on communist influence in the labor movement and the New Deal. In 1938, conservatives rode an economic downturn and a backlash against labor radicalism and the court-packing scheme to huge midterm victories-effectively ending the era of leftist change.\n\nDisorder fueled a backlash in the mid-'60s, too. Five days after the signing of the Voting Rights Act, riots broke out in Los Angeles. In the following three years, riots led to 225 deaths and more than $100 billion in property damage. From 1964 to 1966, the percentage of Americans who told pollsters that the move toward racial equality was happening \"too fast\" jumped from 34 to 85 percent. In 1966, Republicans-stressing law and order-won 47 seats in the House.\n\nThe GOP is already pursuing a similar strategy today. A recent Republican National Committee ad intersperses footage of protesters and rioters with Cory Booker calling on activists to \"get up in the face of some congresspeople\" and Representative Maxine Waters urging people to confront Trump Cabinet members in restaurants, department stores, and gas stations. Since protesters interrupted Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing, Republicans have begun calling Democrats a \"mob\" (without acknowledging that it is Trump, not Democrats, who has encouraged his crowds to commit violence). Like their predecessors, today's conservatives will probably spend the coming era accusing the left of fomenting radicalism and lawlessness. Like its predecessors, the third left will rise and fall on its ability to convince Americans that the true cause of radicalism is injustice, and the best guarantee of social peace is a more equal country.\n\nThis article appears in the December 2018 print edition with the headline \"How Far Will the Left Go?\""

      "text": "Why Millennial Leftists Have Made a BBC Filmmaker a Cult Hero\n\nFlowing dreamlike between pop culture, politics, and psychology, Adam Curtis's documentaries both complicate and articulate a senseless world.\n\nAn Adam Curtis documentary might start with images like these: a group of men waltzing with invisible partners, the wealth of the British empire running through their tailcoats; shaky mobile-phone footage of a bomb in Afghanistan; a young Donald Trump in a helicopter, Manhattan spread out below; an aerobics instructor clad in '80s pink and sticky lip gloss; a man shot in the head, bleeding in the dirt; a panda sneezing.\n\nThe footage might be tied together by a haunting Burial or Aphex Twin song. A title card in Arial font could declare something like THE OLD SYSTEM WAS DYING . Then perhaps Curtis's disembodied voice, all elongated vowels and faint adenoidal superiority, would augur that \"this was a fantasy.\" For the many fans of the longtime BBC journalist, this combination-surreal, funny, disturbing-is part of what makes him revered. At the heart of Curtis's appeal is his consistent assertion, both in style and in substance, that society does not make sense anymore.\n\nCurtis began his career at the U.K.'s national broadcaster in the early 1980s, but his style emerged clearly with 1992's Pandora's Box. An exploration of the rise of technocratic politics amid the fall of the U.S.S.R., the series won Curtis his first two BAFTAs (his documentaries would go on to win two more). With this success-and his infinite access to the BBC's substantial archives-Curtis's oeuvre took shape, culminating in 2011's All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace, which looks at the rise of modern technology, and 2016's HyperNormalisation, about the West's retreat from political complexity. His most recent series is this year's Can't Get You Out of My Head , a history of individualism.\n\nIn a particular kind of person -Millennial, leftist, overly online-Curtis inspires a specific fandom. His recent appearances on Red Scare and Chapo Trap House , podcasts of the Millennial \" dirtbag left, \" seem to have cemented his status among malcontent 20-somethings. An editor for Dazed wrote that witnessing Curtis's popularity \"among our generation\" was \"fascinating\"; The Economist named Curtis \"a cult-hero to young thinkers.\" When an interviewer for the socialist magazine Jacobin remarked to Curtis that he was watched by \"lots of disaffected young people,\" the filmmaker said he didn't know why he had this audience, but had heard that kids were holding \"all-night\" viewing parties for one of his documentaries in outer-London squats.\n\nThe key to Curtis's style is an interplay of decontextualized music and archival footage that examines heady, seemingly disparate subjects such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the rise of psychology, and pop culture. By threading a patchwork of references together, Curtis unveils the interconnectedness of society's systems. His declarations can feel like revelations: emotional truths that one has long suspected but never uncovered. Yet his documentaries also veer rapidly between tragic and comedic, sometimes appearing intent on provoking a reaction from the viewer. Curtis's filmmaking has an early-YouTube, Internet Archive aesthetic that almost replicates the strangeness of the web in the early to mid aughts: scraps of news clips, home videos, proto-memes, lurid celebrity gossip. He seems fluent in my generation's dead tongue.\n\nCurtis's style is so distinctive that parodies of his work are common, particularly on Twitter. These include a bingo card (with boxes that read \"Grainy film of oil sheikhs,\" and \"Ronald Reagan\"), jokes about the \" Adam Curtis voice ,\" and references to his penchant for declaring that \" something incredible happened .\" Earlier this year, when a fitness influencer in Myanmar went viral for filming herself obliviously performing aerobics as, behind her, military vehicles rolled into Parliament to wrest power from the government, I saw the same joke again and again on my social-media feeds: This is part of an Adam Curtis documentary .\n\nThis devotion might seem curious. Curtis is, after all, a BBC journalist in the most traditional sense: Oxbridge educated, older, male, white. He typically refuses to take a political stance in interviews, saying that he distrusts labels and ideologies. When I asked Alan Finlayson, a professor of political and social theory at the U.K.'s University of East Anglia, about Curtis, he told me via email that he has always thought of the documentarian as \"rather conservative.\" \"The general argument [of Curtis's work] seems to be that history is made by individuals and not larger historical or social forces, that ideas are always to be suspected (especially those of philosophers and scientists), and we shouldn't trust people with plans for improving things,\" Finlayson said. Curtis's lack of any real analysis of the failures of popular left-wing figures such as Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanders has also attracted criticism , while his refusal to adhere to a single political philosophy has tended to infuriate leftist commentators . (Curtis recently asserted that he is a \"progressive\" who is \"emotionally sympathetic to radicalism,\" whatever that means.)\n\nCuriously, when I asked Charlie Beckett, a professor and the director of the London School of Economics' media think tank, Polis, what he made of Curtis's popularity, his view was the opposite of Finlayson's. Curtis \"offers an explanation of the world that must be attractive to Leftists frustrated by their continuing lack of electoral appeal or political success in countries like the U.K.,\" he told me in an email. \"It's much easier to blame shadowy corporate forces than political realities.\"\n\nDerek Thompson: The Millennials-versus-Boomers fight divides the Democratic Party\n\nBut these contrasting interpretations are precisely what might explain Curtis's popularity among young adults. His enthusiasm for tricky, often contradictory, ideas feels refreshing to those who came of age in a world of social-media moralizing, simplistic documentaries, and smug opinion pieces. With one foot in the early-internet, pre-9/11, pre-Great Recession world and the other in the contemporary mire of social media, unstable work, and a housing crisis, Millennials are acutely aware of senselessness. This generation has a nagging feeling that somewhere along the way, something has gone deeply, catastrophically wrong .\n\nIn this light, Curtis's commitment to the weird-the juxtaposition of partnerless dancers, aerobics instructors, and grisly news footage-expresses the bizarreness of society. The way to effectively communicate a system that does not make sense is to do away with the pretense of sense itself. For Millennial leftists focused on uncovering and dismantling power structures that they feel have disadvantaged their generation, Curtis's analysis of how society functions-or fails to function-is attractive. To some progressives, the establishment media frequently focuses on trivialities and elevated gossip instead of analyzing how overarching structures might be flawed. When I spoke with writer and critic Jon Doyle , about Curtis, he focused on the filmmaker's use of typically unseen news footage-the cutting-room-floor clips in which anchors bluster and bumble, and eerie silences appear between interviewers and guests. \"Everything is more chaotic, more banal, more confusing than we want to admit,\" Doyle said.\n\nCurtis's work ultimately feels rare because he not only acknowledges the surrealism of the world but constructs a narrative about this strangeness. For people attempting to understand why society has ceased to function well, Curtis's documentaries question the idea that we can expect nothing better, that everything is as it should be. And that's why Curtis's Millennial fans don't mind if he focuses too much on the individual or the institutions, or whether his themes might skew leftist, or conservative, or smarter-than-thou. Even if Curtis offers no solutions, simply vocalizing the seemingly unspoken is enough."

      "text": "Leftists in Academe\n\nGreg Mankiw points to an interesting, if slightly dyspeptic, essay on the puzzle of academic bias to the left. Thomas Reeves says it is mostly due to envy, aggravated by (relative) financial distress. Times are hard for scholars.\n\nSerious economic problems face the glowing, self-confident scholar with little money. How, for example, is he able to find adequate housing? Even US$300,000, well beyond the reach of most young and many senior professors, won't buy much in Boston, New York, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Atlanta or Chicago, not to mention Madison, Sarasota, Ann Arbor, Palo Alto or Santa Barbara. The affluent suburbs, where the successful in other fields gather, are out of the question, of course. And so many of us move into older, deteriorating, often dangerous areas, telling all who listen that we made the choice deliberately and that we, being humanists, have a natural desire to live among the poor and oppressed. In my experience, some English and anthropology professors actually believe this nonsense, and enjoy dressing as factory workers and displaying furniture obviously purchased at a rummage sale.\n\nIn this talk from 1998, Robert Nozick put it down to a subtly different cause : a sense of frustrated entitlement. Intellectuals are trained to believe that the market has overthrown the proper allocation of reward according to merit. Note the difference: envy is wrong; insisting on reward by merit (however Utopian) is right.\n\nThe intellectual wants the whole society to be a school writ large, to be like the environment where he did so well and was so well appreciated. By incorporating standards of reward that are different from the wider society, the schools guarantee that some will experience downward mobility later. Those at the top of the school's hierarchy will feel entitled to a top position, not only in that micro-society but in the wider one, a society whose system they will resent when it fails to treat them according to their self-prescribed wants and entitlements. The school system thereby produces anti-capitalist feeling among intellectuals.\n\nOf course, the two causes are not mutually exclusive."

      "text": "The Millennials-Versus-Boomers Fight Divides the Democratic Party\n\nThe young left has become a sort of third party.\n\nThe United States is a fortress of gerontocracy besieged by a youth rebellion. America's leaders are old-very old. The average age in Congress has never been higher , and our national leaders are all approaching 80. Nancy Pelosi was born in 1940, Mitch McConnell came along in 1942, and Donald Trump, the baby of this power trio, followed in 1946, making him several weeks older than his predecessors Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. The two leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, are 77 and 78 years old, respectively. Every individual in this paragraph came into the world before the International Monetary Fund and the CIA; before the invention of the transistor and the Polaroid camera; before the Roswell UFO incident and the independence of India.\n\nThe nation's finances are almost as skewed toward the elderly as its politics are. Americans 55 and up account for less than one-third of the population, but they own two-thirds of the nation's wealth, according to the Federal Reserve . That's the highest level of elderly wealth concentration on record. The reason is simple: To an unprecedented degree, older Americans own the most valuable real estate and investment portfolios. They've captured more than 80 percent of stock-market growth since the end of the Great Recession.\n\nAmericans under the age of 40, for their part, are historically well educated, historically peaceful, and historically law-abiding. But this impressive résumé of conscientiousness hasn't translated into much economic or political power.\n\nInstead, young Americans beset with high student debt ran into the buzz saw of a painful recession and slow recovery. Today they are poorer, in income and in wealth, than similarly young groups of previous decades. \"In the U.S, as in the U.K. and in much of Europe, 2008 was the end of the end of history,\" says Keir Milburn, the author of Generation Left , a book on young left-wing movements. \"The last decade in the U.K. has been the worst decade for wage growth for 220 years. In the U.S., this generation is the first in a century that expects to have lower lifetime earnings than their parents. It has created an epochal shift.\"\n\nYoung Americans demanding more power, control, and justice have veered sharply to the left. This lurch was first evident in the two elections of Barack Obama, when he won the youth vote by huge margins. And young Americans didn't edge back to the political center under Obama; they just kept moving left. Obama won about 60 percent of voters younger than 30 in the 2008 primary. Bernie Sanders won more than 70 percent of under-30 voters in the 2016 primary, which pushed Hillary Clinton to the left and dragged issues like Medicare for All and free college from the fringe to the mainstream of political debate.\n\nTo many observers, it might seem like young voters have remade the Democratic Party in their image-as a claque of \"woke\" socialists . In May, the historian Niall Ferguson and Eyck Freymann, a research analyst, wrote in The Atlantic that the U.S. was at the brink of a great generation war, in which older conservative Republicans would do battle with Democrats, who were \"rapidly becoming the party of the young.\"\n\nBut upon closer examination, the Democrats aren't really the party of the young-or, for that matter, of social-justice leftists. In the most sophisticated poll of the Iowa caucus , Joe Biden polled at 2 percent among voters under 30, within the margin of error of zero. Nationally, he is in single digits among Millennials, the generation born between 1981 and 1996. Yet Biden is the Democratic front-runner for the 2020 presidential nomination, thanks to his huge advantage among older voters-especially older black voters-who are considerably more moderate than younger Democrats.\n\nBernie Sanders, by contrast, leads all candidates among voters under 30 and polls just 5 percent among voters over 65. In a national Quinnipiac poll asking voters which candidate has the best ideas, Sanders crushes Biden 27 percent to 4 percent among those under 35 and receives an equal and opposite crushing at the hands of Biden among voters over 65: 28 percent to 4 percent.\n\nAge ‬doesn't just divide Republicans and Democrats from each other, in other words; age divides young leftists from both Republicans and Democrats . Democrats under 30 have almost no measurable interest in the party's front-runner. Democrats over 65 have almost no measurable interest in the favored candidate of the younger generation. ‬This is not a picture of Democrats smoothly transforming into the \"party of the young.\" It's evidence that age-perhaps even more than class or race-is now the most important fault line within the Democratic Party.‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬\n\nIt might be most useful to think about ‬young progressives as a third party trapped in a two-party system. Radicalized by America's political sclerosis and economic and social inequality, they are a powerful movement politically domiciled within a larger coalition of moderate older minorities and educated suburbanites, who don't always know what to do with their rambunctious bunkmates.\n\nNiall Ferguson and Eyck Freymann: The coming generation war\n\nWhat would this progressive third party's platform look like? In one word, justice: Social justice, sought through a reappraisal of power relationships in social and corporate life, and economic justice, sought through the redistribution of income from the rich to the less fortunate.\n\nOne can make out the contours of this agenda in \"Hidden Tribes,\" a 2018 study of the political views of 8,000 Americans, which sorted the country's voting-age population into seven political groups. The study called the youngest and most left-wing group in the survey Progressive Activists. They accounted for 8 percent of the population and as much as one-third of likely voters in the Democratic Party, due to their higher-than-average engagement in politics. (I don't want to imply that Sanders voters and the Progressive Activist tribe are synonymous: The demographics of Elizabeth Warren's support suggest that she attracts a large number of Progressive Activists too.)\n\nCompared with the average American, Progressive Activists-\"young, secular, cosmopolitan, and angry\"-were more likely to be under 30, college-educated, and white; twice as likely to say they never pray; and three times as likely to say they're \"ashamed\" of the country. They are motivated by the existential threat of climate change, strongly pro-immigration, and more concerned about police brutality than about crime or terrorism. Perhaps most distinctive, they are attuned to structural challenges in society and skeptical of the individualist strain of the American dream. In response to a question about whether personal responsibility or broader socioeconomic factors are more important for determining success, 95 percent of Progressive Activists said that \"some people's situations are so challenging that no amount of work will allow them to find success.\" Most Americans, including 69 percent of moderates, preferred this statement: \"People who work hard can find success no matter what situation they were born into.\"\n\nThis group's support for Medicare for All, free college, and student-debt relief is sometimes likened to a \"give me free stuff\" movement. But every movement wants free stuff, if by free stuff one means \"stuff given preferential treatment in the tax code.\" By this definition, Medicare is free stuff, and investment income is free stuff, and suburban home values propped up by the mortgage-interest deduction are free stuff. The free stuff in the tax code today benefits Americans with income and wealth-a population that is disproportionately old. Medicare for All might be politically infeasible, but it is, taken literally, a request that the federal government extend to the entire population the insurance benefits now exclusively reserved for the elderly. That's not hatred or resentment; it sounds more like justice.\n\nBen Judah: The Millennial left is tired of waiting\n\nMost Americans over 40 support several measures of both social justice and economic justice. But across ethnicities, many Americans have a deep aversion to anything that can be characterized as \"political correctness\" or \"socialism.\" And this might be the biggest challenge for the young progressive agenda.\n\nFor example, the Democratic presidential candidates who focused most explicitly on sexism and racial injustice have flamed out . In its premortem for Kamala Harris's presidential run, The New York Times quoted one anonymous adviser who blamed the candidate's struggles on the misguided idealism of her younger staffers, who took their cues from an unrepresentative sample of Twitter activists. Beto O'Rourke's campaign, too, was widely derided as a shallow attempt to create viral moments for his woke online followers . ‬Notably, these candidates failed to win much support among the very demographic groups for which they were advocating. ‬‬\n\nSecond, the progressive economic agenda might be suffused with the egalitarian ethic, but its landmark policies aren't that popular. While Medicare for All often polls well, its public support is exquisitely sensitive to framing. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the net favorability of eliminating private insurance or requiring most Americans to pay more in taxes -both part of the Sanders plan-is negative-23 points.\n\nThe Medicare for All debate is a microcosm of a larger divide. The young left's deep skepticism toward capitalism simply isn't shared by previous generations. According to Gallup polling, Gen X is firmly pro-capitalist and Baby Boomers, who came of age during the Cold War, prefer capitalism over socialism by a two-to-one margin . (You can point out to your parents that Social Security and Medicare are, essentially, socialism for the old, but that's not the same as converting them into Berniecrats.)\n\n\"This is only the halfway point of an epochal change in Western politics following the Great Recession,\" Keir Milburn says. The far right has responded with calls for xenophobic nationalism to preserve national identity, while the left has responded with calls for social democracy to restore socioeconomic justice. \"I must admit that the far right is ascendant, but they have no answer to the future because they've given up on the future. The young left has identified that the future of adulthood no longer feels viable to many people, and it's putting together a different vision.\"\n\nAssuming Milburn's analysis is correct, the young progressive movement will have to shed its first adjective in order to gain power. In 2016, voters older than 40 accounted for nearly three-fifths of all primary voters . It is impossible to win a national election by running a campaign of generational warfare that runs counter to, or directly indicts, a majority of the electorate. One way or another, America's third party will have to grow up."

      "text": "The Progressive Activist Begging the Left to Stop Owning Itself\n\nSean McElwee has a simple message for his compatriots: Rigid doctrinarianism doesn't win elections.\n\nUpdated at 3:45 p.m. ET on September 16, 2020.\n\nwhen word got out in early March that Joe Biden's campaign had invited the progressive pollster Sean McElwee to a meeting on climate policy, some on the far left were outraged. Sure, Bernie Sanders's presidential prospects weren't looking great, but the senator had not yet suspended his campaign. So why , McElwee's critics demanded to know, would he agree to advise the former vice president? Hundreds of leftists spent more than a month dragging him on Twitter, flooding his mentions with insults: One user with a Homer Simpson avatar accused him of being a sellout . Another, who went by the handle \"party rocking LLC,\" called him a \"rat.\" One night at a bar in New York City, a stranger confronted McElwee about it: \"Man,\" the person said, \"I thought you were a leftist.\"\n\nBy most definitions, McElwee is a leftist. The 27-year-old had launched his firm, Data for Progress, explicitly to advance progressive causes, and his client list includes Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Sunrise Movement, perhaps the country's most prominent climate-activist organization. He came onto the progressive scene in early 2018, when he helped popularize the slogan \"Abolish ICE,\" and became a reliable fount of cocky, expletive-laden quotes for reporters covering the left. He once half-jokingly threatened to cancel me at a party.\n\nBut over the past year or so, McElwee seems to have reassessed his position in the left-wing firmament. He no longer talks about eliminating Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Instead, he's become an evangelist of political persuasion and coalition-building. He's become much more openly critical of his progressive compatriots. And most shocking to some of those compatriots, he's advised the Biden campaign.\n\n\"I've come to the realization that the Democratic Party is actually ripe for a transformation into a progressive vehicle,\" McElwee told me. Progressives should be working to build power and influence within the party, district by district and voter by voter-not to overthrow it. \"We have lost this muscle of persuasion,\" he said.\n\nThis conflict over progressive purity is the newest iteration of the one leftists waged during the Democratic primary-a fight that started between the Sanders and Elizabeth Warren wings of the left and lives on in progressive-activist circles and on Twitter. As progressives attempt to chart their path forward, how they resolve these tensions will determine whether and how they will be able to exert influence in a possible Biden administration. Who will hold actual power, and who will be on the outside looking in?\n\nRead: Sanders supporters realize their party is bigger than they are\n\nMcElwee's critics see him as a hypocrite, a grifter, a \"professional progressive\" who has abandoned the left-in its moment of weakness, no less-to cozy up with centrists. To them, his approach smacks of incrementalism-the scourge of compromise for compromise's sake, and the opposite of the swift, systemic change that they believe is so urgent. Why work to persuade existing voters , they ask, when you can employ bold, ambitious ideas to awaken a legion of brand-new ones? Why attempt to reform the Democratic Party when you can conquer it?\n\n\"It is notable that [McElwee didn't] really start talking like this until after the [primary],\" says Matt Bruenig, who once worked with McElwee at the liberal think tank Demos and now runs the People's Policy Project, a small left-wing policy institute. McElwee could be positioning himself to maintain his influence and his donor base, Bruenig speculated. Data for Progress does good work, he told me, but \"just because you do some polling doesn't mean you know how to win elections.\"\n\nIn their March meeting, McElwee and a colleague attempted to persuade the Biden team to endorse a kind of quasi-Green New Deal. Their hope: If the presumptive Democratic nominee took a stronger stance on climate change in particular, he could get more young people and progressives excited about his campaign. They urged the campaign to endorse a commitment to reaching net-zero emissions by mid-century, and to invest in low-income communities that are disproportionately affected by pollution. The Biden team was worried that moving left on climate would be all risk and no reward. But McElwee assured them that it would be both popular and good policy. They didn't extract much in the way of immediate commitments, McElwee told me after the meeting. But he had-he has-a longer-term plan.\n\nM cElwee is tall-6 foot 2- with pale skin and the wardrobe of your typical hipster Millennial, including trendy glasses and snapback hats. Over the past six months, he's sent me dozens of texts and emails airily predicting the outcomes of primary races, touting the accuracy of his polling, and dropping f-bombs and movie references like a good-natured, if somewhat self-satisfied, frat bro. \"Weak tea,\" he texted me simply, when I asked him to respond to some criticism. \"Yeah, I'm good at politics,\" he replied when I mentioned his accurate prediction in 2018 that Representative Eliot Engel of New York would be unseated in 2020. With this tendency toward smug irreverence, McElwee might seem like a good fit for the so-called Dirtbag Left, the contingent of pundits who have attracted fans by advocating for left-wing ideas using dark humor and dank memes. But that's never really been his crowd.\n\nMcElwee has the zeal of a convert because he is one. After college, he started his career as an intern at the libertarian Reason Foundation and the Fox Business Network, but quickly became disillusioned with conservative politics. In 2014, he took a data-analyst job at Demos, and four years later, started Data for Progress as a side project, drawing on publicly available data to evaluate and explain the popularity of progressive policies. His firm partnered with YouGov to do polling on reparations, universal basic income, the Green New Deal, abolishing ICE-the gamut. They also tested progressive arguments for and Republican arguments against the policies, to show more nuanced results.\n\n\"The Venn diagram of people with a pretty radical analysis [of politics] who are devoted to operational electoral politics is pretty small,\" Chris Hayes, the progressive commentator and MSNBC host, told me. McElwee \"is in that space.\"\n\nToday, Data for Progress is a fully fledged company with 10 employees-it's part polling firm (it does its own surveys now), part think tank, and part activist group. Its clients fall along a spectrum of progressive thought, from Sanders and Warren to the Sierra Club. In July, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer blogged on the firm's website in support of extending the $600 unemployment expansion.\n\nMcElwee describes his first year running the operation, in 2018, as \"the first stage of Sean.\" He became Twitter-famous in progressive circles, amassing many thousands of followers, in part, by encouraging leftists to challenge the Democratic establishment. Ocasio-Cortez adopted his #AbolishICE mantra in the lead-up to the midterm elections. Politico Magazine ranked him on its 2018 list of the 50 most influential thinkers in politics. That year, he was quoted as envisioning a socialist politics that \"strives for a radical flattening of the global income distribution.\"\n\nRead: What 'Abolish ICE' actually means\n\nThe second stage of Sean seems to have begun about a year ago. McElwee started talking much less about moonshot progressive goals and much more about tailoring the progressive message to mainstream Democratic voters. He eased up on the snark, too-nowadays, his Twitter profile is an infinite scroll of Data for Progress reports (a change that hasn't escaped his detractors). Today, he characterizes his own push for the abolition of ICE as an attempt to shift the Overton window , though that wasn't at all clear at the time. \"It's time to rein in the greatest threat we face: an unaccountable strike force executing a campaign of ethnic cleansing,\" he wrote in an 2018 op-ed for The Nation , right as public anger over the caging of immigrants in border detention centers had begun to swell. (In recent days, McElwee has retweeted others' calls to abolish ICE following reports of forced hysterectomies inside a Georgia facility, but he hasn't made such calls himself.)\n\nNow, McElwee said, he's focused on the nitty-gritty work of politics, while trying to reassure leftists that Biden and his team are, in fact, very receptive to progressive ideas. \"It's easy for people who sit in their apartments in Brooklyn who post 20 times a day to believe that everyone who does the work is a sellout,\" McElwee told me recently. \"I am doing more and more politics.\"\n\nHeather McGhee, McElwee's former boss and the former president at Demos, told me that Sean has been \"influenced by a vision that says We want the left to take over the Democratic Party -which is different than We want the left to replace it or burn it down .\"\n\nMcElwee is still adamant that movements should be idealistic. But he has a blueprint for progressive up-and-comers that focuses only on what's achievable. In short: Left-wing candidates-especially those in tough districts-should run on popular ideas.\n\nIn February, Data for Progress distributed a survey to 78,000 Americans of all political persuasions, laying out a series of arguments for and against a set of 50 progressive policies and asking them to rank their support for each. The agenda items that were supported by more than half of respondents included clean water, paid family leave, generic drug licensing, and free two-year college. (Abolishing ICE, meanwhile, ranked among the 10 least popular ideas.)\n\nThat polling offers clear lessons, McElwee argues: Instead of a carbon tax, candidates should talk about investing in 100 percent clean energy, an idea that 51 percent of respondents favored. They would do well to campaign heavily on paid family leave, which received 60 percent support. And instead of championing Medicare for All (40 percent support), leftist candidates who need to win over Republicans and moderates should push to expand Medicaid and \"motherfuck the pharmaceutical industry.\" (Translation: Revoke patent rights on the most expensive drugs and approve government manufacturing of generics). According to the survey, all of these health-care ideas are supported by more than 52 percent of Americans.\n\nPast precedent, though, shows that campaigning on these themes isn't exactly a surefire formula. Hillary Clinton ran on paid family leave and clean energy and still lost. But McElwee waves away that example, arguing that her experience wasn't representative: She was an unpopular candidate with unique political baggage. Even wildly popular policies become less appealing when they're tied to politicians voters don't trust.\n\nNor is McElwee especially concerned that his method-of encouraging Democrats who support, say, single-payer health care to talk up other reforms in order to get elected-could seem disingenuous. Emphasizing feasible and politically popular ideas is what politics is all about, McElwee argues: You have to build trust to set the stage for Medicare for All, which McElwee said he fully supports, and future ambitious agenda items. \"You need to change the way that [voters] understand Democrats by using more popular policies,\" he said. \"There are lots of popular ideas that you can pass into law, and people can be like, Oh shit, Democrats said they were gonna do that thing, and they fuckin' did it! \"\n\nM cElwee is not the only one in progressive circles making this argument-he's just one of the loudest. In 2016, two years before McElwee even started Data for Progress, the Progressive Change Institute completed its own survey of progressive policy ideas and came away with a similar conclusion. \"If voters have limited time and attention to focus on elections, why would you focus their attention on the less popular ideas when they could be focused on the most popular ideas?\" Adam Green, a co-founder of the group, told me.\n\nMcGhee, the former Demos president, framed progressives' decision-making as a matter of priorities. \"You have to be committed to winning real gains for the people at every step of the way as you build power,\" she said. Progressives \"stopped fighting on Medicaid expansion in predominantly Black states, and people are dying because we only want to talk about Medicare for All.\" (Many on the left would dispute this, and argue that pushing for Medicare for All and for expanding Medicaid aren't mutually exclusive.)\n\nThe battle between the idealistic, doctrinarian wing of the progressive movement and the more electorally minded one may still be raging, but recent elections have supported McElwee's theory of the case. In 2018, for example, a number of lefty lawmakers won elected office by campaigning on popular policies and uniting broad coalitions of support. They're not the leaders most Americans associate with the progressive movement, such as Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, and Rashida Tlaib. They're people like Representatives Mike Levin and Katie Porter of California, and Lauren Underwood and Sean Casten of Illinois-four freshman legislators who successfully flipped House seats from red to blue that year.\n\nRead: Katie Porter is tired, too\n\nNone of these candidates branded themselves as ultra-left, and only Porter campaigned explicitly on an immediate push for Medicare for All. When they spoke about left-wing ideas, they did so in a way that appealed to the voters of their respective districts, \"not the way that makes people on Twitter feel good,\" said McElwee, who calls these lawmakers \"normie progressives.\" The most radical leftists running in red districts didn't fare nearly as well: Randy \"IronStache\" Bryce, the progressive favorite to replace former House Speaker Paul Ryan, lost by double digits in 2018. So did Abdul El-Sayed, the Medicare for All champion who lost the Michigan gubernatorial primary to the more moderate Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nIn mourning those losses, the far left failed to celebrate the wins of people such as Levin and Underwood, McElwee said. Indeed, many leftists don't seem to appreciate just how progressive congressional Democrats have really become: Party ideology has veered leftward in the past decade, and Democrats now harbor much more liberal views on issues such as health care, immigration, and race. Nearly all Democratic House members support abortion rights, stricter gun-control legislation, and an ambitious response to climate change. Ten years ago, progressives tried and failed to include a public option for health insurance in the Affordable Care Act; now most House Democrats support some form of government-funded health care. Yet during the 2020 primary, leftists excoriated multiple Democratic candidates for endorsing a public option instead of Medicare for All. \"Every time we have a victory, there's some people who claim that that victory isn't an actual victory,\" McElwee said.\n\nThe New York primary this summer was one example of this shortsightedness. When I talked with McElwee in the days leading up to the June election, he was almost frantic with excitement. Data for Progress's polling showed three congressional candidates-Jamaal Bowman, Mondaire Jones, and Ritchie Torres-ahead in their respective primary races, and McElwee was anxious to be proven right.\n\nThe Torres race, in New York's 15th district, was the one McElwee was most enthusiastic about, arguing that it would demonstrate the effectiveness of a \"normie progressive\" approach to politics. Torres, a gay, Afro-Latino member of the New York City Council, had local establishment support and had been endorsed by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He called himself an \"independent progressive\" and focused his campaign on housing. Leftist activists and lawmakers didn't care much for him; Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez had endorsed Torres's opponent, Samelys López, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America who advocated for establishing Medicare for All, abolishing ICE, and canceling student debt.\n\nWhen I called McElwee the morning after, he was in expectedly high spirits: Bowman and Jones looked poised to win their primaries-both ultimately did -and Torres was on track to defeat López by double digits. After a long ballot count, López earned just 14 percent of the vote . \"This is a point for the normie-progressive theory of change,\" McElwee told me.\n\nA more recent example helps illustrate what's at stake when progressives fail to coalesce behind a single candidate. In the early-September Democratic primary to replace Representative Joe Kennedy in Massachusetts, McElwee and Data for Progress backed the progressive candidate Jesse Mermell, a former aide to Governor Deval Patrick, while other leftists supported Ihssane Leckey, a Democratic Socialist McElwee dismissed as a \"poster\"-someone who is deeply immersed in the politics of Twitter. Of the two, polls showed that Mermell was much better positioned to win, but Leckey didn't drop out, and leftists continued to campaign hard for her. On September 1, Mermell lost the primary by just 1 percent to Jake Auchincloss, a former Republican political organizer. \"This is exactly why we need to take this seriously,\" McElwee told me. The far left \"spent the whole campaign bashing Mermell ...\" he trailed off. \"God, I'm gonna be pissed about that forever.\" With each loss, though, McElwee hopes that leftists will come closer to understanding the error of their ways-that building coalitions and persuading voters is the only way to win. \"Listen to Sean,\" he said. \"This is the lesson.\"\n\nThis sort of cockiness is one reason that McElwee so rankles his left-wing critics. But mostly, his critics have a very different idea of what building coalitions and persuading voters should look like. Progressives should keep their focus on making gains among working-class voters instead of softening their message to appeal to moderates and wealthy suburbanites, says Bhaskar Sunkara, the founding editor and publisher of Jacobin , a New York-based socialist magazine. It doesn't matter that Sanders tried and failed with that approach-twice. This \"is the route to social democratic change in America,\" he told me.\n\n\"'The left' has come to mean big, clear-cut ideas like Medicare for All and free public college for all,\" echoed Matt Karp, a history professor at Princeton and a Jacobin contributor, in a recent interview. \"It doesn't seem like progressives should be in the business of shrinking those expectations as they're starting to grow.\" In an article last month, Karp wrote that a progressive movement following McElwee's vision would be defined by social-media activism and a friendly relationship with so-called corporate Democrats. \"Imagine Sean McElwee giving a keynote address at the Walmart Center for Racial Equity-forever,\" Karp wrote.\n\nBut Biden, not Sanders, is the new leader of the Democratic Party, and even in the best-case scenario for progressives, they'll have to advance their agenda under a Biden administration. This is what McElwee said he recognized back in March, when he ignored his critics and agreed to the meeting with the Biden campaign. Biden's team had incentive to listen, McElwee thought, given how much the former vice president needs young people and former Sanders supporters to vote for him in November.\n\nIn fact, given his good standing among moderates and his relationship with parts of the labor movement, a President Biden might be able to implement progressive policies in a way that doesn't alienate centrists or make himself especially vulnerable to Republican attacks. He may actually be uniquely suited for passing progressive policies. During the Democratic National Convention in mid-August, Sanders trumpeted a list of progressive priorities that Biden's campaign has committed to advancing, including a $15 an hour minimum wage and paid family leave. \"Biden really could be a crypto-progressive president,\" Julian Noisecat, the vice president of policy and strategy at Data for Progress, told me. (The Trump campaign has suggested something similar, warning repeatedly during the Republican National Convention that Biden would be a \"Trojan horse\" for radical-left ideas.)\n\nRead: Biden goes big without sounding like it\n\nLate one evening in mid-July, I got a text from McElwee: Had I seen the Bloomberg scoop ? Biden was about to announce a package of climate proposals advocated by some of the most progressive climate groups. The next day, I watched as Biden, standing on a flag-decorated stage in Wilmington, Delaware, peeled back his face mask and unveiled a new plan that would invest $2 trillion over four years to achieve 100 percent clean energy by 2035. The proposal would also guarantee that 40 percent of all clean-energy funding goes to marginalized communities. Although the package does not exactly match the vision of the Green New Deal championed by Ocasio-Cortez, it is, as New York magazine's Eric Levitz wrote , \"remarkably close to the narrower version of the Green New Deal outlined by the progressive think tank Data for Progress.\" McElwee had gotten what he wanted."

      "text": "'In My Isolation, I Searched for Sanity on the Internet'\n\nA collection of reader concurrences and dissents with responses.\n\nLast month, I argued that the left's rhetoric can sometimes fuel support for the populist right and that folks who want to defeat its most bigoted incarnations should act accordingly. For example, they should cease mislabeling others \"alt-right\" so promiscuously and study up on the factors that trigger authoritarian tendencies.\n\nThe whole article is here . Lots of people responded to it. Below I'll air a selection of concurrences and dissents. And I'll begin by highlighting two common misreadings:\n\nA civic discourse that forces writers to answer for arguments that they explicitly disavowed benefits no one.\n\nThere are many ways that rhetoric on one side of the political spectrum affects the other side. Some correspondents suggested possible mechanisms that I did not address. Austin Anthis emailed, \"I was a moderate student at Duke University and found myself so attacked for my beliefs there that I would escape into my room and watch conservative pundits talk some 'sense' that I could not find on campus. I've seen what you described take place in my own life. I hope people take it to heart.\"\n\nI wondered, Exactly what views were others attacking? Was he advocating for racism? Sexism? Torture? The return of prohibition? Some views ought to be savaged. He was gracious enough to clarify on the record. He began by writing about his formal training as an RA and the norms inculcated by his boss and coworkers:\n\nOne memorable example...\n\nAnother RA expressed concern about a \"Trump\" sign hanging outside a resident's window. There seemed to be unanimous consent in the room that the sign was inappropriate or at least undesirable and my boss made that explicit. She said that although policy forbade her from taking down some signs without taking down all, she would stop by the resident's room and \"remind them that their behavior affects other people.\"\n\nWhen I voiced concern about censoring political speech, I was blasted by a fellow RA who called Trump's name \"hate speech\" because of what it represents.\n\nI myself did not vote for Trump and do not respect him. But it was shocking to me that what seemed like the majority of students and faculty would be fine with censoring political speech they disagreed with. The culture was more concerned with silencing dissent than fostering it.\n\nAnother example concerned an incident on campus. One morning, a small rope tied in the shape of a noose was found on the main yard. The administration and students were outraged at this overt display of racism.\n\nI was ready to condemn the racist perpetrator with them.\n\nAfter several days of protests and threats, news slowly leaked that an international student had hung up the noose to text his friends and ask them to \"hang out.\" While the joke wasn't the most sensitive or wise, there was absolutely no racist motivation. And yet, I heard students calling for the student's expulsion. Luckily, I do not think the administration complied, but for my next few years on campus, I would hear students talk about the \"noose incident\" as an example of pervasive racism on campus. I am as morally opposed to racism as anyone else, but it rubbed me the wrong way when some people insisted on bolstering their claims with stories that were demonstrably false.\n\n[ Note: An official Duke investigation attributed the incident to the international student's \"ignorance\" of the symbol and \"bad judgment.\" He was not expelled. Excerpts from his apology are here .]\n\nIn these and other scenarios, I felt like there was almost no one who I could confide in without being shamed for my stance. It seemed beliefs as innocuous and bipartisan as the right to political speech on campus were too outrageous to hold. In my isolation, I searched for sanity on the internet. I still remember the first afternoon I discovered the videos of brash conservative pundit Steven Crowder on YouTube. I gorged for hours, feeling pent-up aggression alleviate as I heard someone else condemn the hypocrisy I found at every turn on campus. I found similar refuge in Sam Harris and Ben Shapiro.\n\nWith some time and distance between Duke and me, I do not look to them nearly as much. I find Steven Crowder's habit of mocking his opponents' appearances petty and annoying and Shapiro's lack of expressed empathy frustrating. I even listen to NPR these days and regularly read The Atlantic , both of which I consider to be left-leaning (I could not have tolerated more liberal media at Duke than I already received).\n\nHowever, in the toxic campus environment of incessant virtue-signaling, counter-factual victimhood and thought suppression, I was driven into the conservative 'intellectual dark web' where I found solace from the barrage. Duke faculty and students want the world to see things the way they do. But I think they push away all but the most-progressive.\n\nPolitically, I stand close to where I did before but I have become embittered by the arguments on the left and view them with much more distaste. Even today, reading the opinion section of the Duke Chronicle will make me angry.\n\nRemember, the point here isn't whether one agrees or disagrees with the positions that this correspondent staked out-the point is that people like him exist, people who voted against President Trump, do not respect him, and feel inclined to condemn perpetrators of racism, but who reacted against leftist rhetoric, whether rightly or wrongly, in a manner that caused a move toward the right.\n\nWhether or not that should happen, it does happen.\n\nI don't recommend that anyone ground their politics in reaction. There will always be people on every side who behave badly. And neither the left nor the anti-Trump coalition can totally purge themselves of people who attack others unfairly. No broad coalition can.\n\nHowever, given the narrow margin that propelled Trump to the White House, and the coming contest for Congress, marginal improvement by the anti-Trump coalition that causes fewer people to be attracted to right-populism could be the difference between Trump and the strain of populism he represents winning or being defeated.\n\nWas there a way for the Duke community to risk less negative polarization that didn't involve ceasing to fight bigotry? Here, Anthis's classmates could have validated rather than stigmatized his concerns about protecting core political speech and refrained from attacking those who sought an accurate, nuanced understanding of an upsetting campus incident.\n\nIn Jonathan Haidt's work on moral psychology, he argues that conservatives care more than liberals about the moral foundations of loyalty, authority, and purity. People with a predisposition to authoritarianism prize oneness and sameness, the scholar Karen Stenner has said, while those who most typically resist authoritarianism tend to greet difference and diversity with excitement and enthusiasm.\n\nThose asymmetries suggest that liberals will have a much harder time cohering around a politics of oneness, sameness, loyalty, authority, or purity than conservatives. The left coalition relies more heavily on difference-loving people who care less about loyalty or authority. Many of them will rebel against petty orthodoxies.\n\nAll that came to mind as I read this email:\n\nAs a lefty, one disconcerting trend I've noticed among my peers is a growing tendency to avoid nuance, uncertainty, and complexity in discourse. I guess this isn't a new phenomenon, but it seems to be gaining intensity especially in discussions around appropriation and identity. My tendency, and I think you can trace it back to the Enlightenment, is to complicate and interrogate truths, not to police them or take them as given.\n\nThis tendency comes with a certain amount of rebellion and questioning of authority, not submitting or conforming to norms. A lot of this kind of rebellious, questioning energy seems to be happening on the right, or with thinkers that you might have thought of as \"left,\" but are moving in some other direction, like Sam Harris. I don't agree with everything Harris is saying, but I like his style, his method, the way he challenges and complicates things.\n\n...there is a reflexive move for some on the left to resist complicating or adding nuance to their arguments in order to strengthen social cohesion right now. As a lefty, I personally would like a way out of that trap towards a freer, more progressive and life-affirming kind of political discourse.\n\nThe reader's use of the word \"trap\" is apt.\n\nIt is understandable that some leftists are tempted by the notion of a pure, loyal, cohesive coalition, and look enviously upon the right's greater success at achieving some of those attributes. But attempting to build that sort of left-leaning coalition is almost certain to fail. The liberal left is too diverse and rebellious to make it work. Those eager to interrogate prevailing norms and to embrace nuance, uncertainty, and complexity will go elsewhere rather than adopt a politics of crude stigma.\n\nHere is a possibly correct critique of my article, via Reddit:\n\n...when men call me a FemiNazi for expressing what I believe to be fair and reasonable feminist ideas, it does #1) piss me off and #2) make me less inclined to engage with anything else they have to say. There is a loss of trust that they are willing to engage with me in good faith, so why waste my time? I do not think it makes me more \"radical\", though. As in, I don't think \"fuck you now I think men are scum.\" BUT, over time, do I become 'more feminist' as a natural result of spending more of my time in feminist safe spaces and less time with centrists and conservatives?\n\nWell, I dunno, maybe. Seems plausible at least.\n\nThat said, I don't think that this kind of marginal influence matters enough to start up a big argument amongst leftists concerning our collective tone. I have a feeling that people who are naturally inclined to be inflammatory/ combative are going to behave that way despite any warnings from their peers about how it could alienate the other side.\n\nI do think it matters enough, but I could well be wrong.\n\nHere's another Reddit user : \"This idea that the left is making the right more racist needs to die a thousand deaths. This shit only goes in one direction, too. Nobody claims that far leftists were driven there by the right.\" Even skipping past how the Redditor misstates my actual argument, I must say I am baffled by this response.\n\nOf course rhetorical effects don't go \"in one direction.\"\n\nThe right's rhetoric has caused millions of people, including many who are reading this article, to move left in their voting patterns or their ideological allegiances.\n\nDonald Trump provides a glaring example. Trump's bigotry toward immigrants and Muslims will, I would wager, hurt the GOP with millennial and Hispanics for a generation, much as Pete Wilson's inflammatory campaign against Proposition 187 cost the California GOP a generation of the youth and Hispanic vote in exchange for a single term in the 1990s.\n\nMore broadly, the leftist response to Trump has labeled itself \"the resistance,\" taken to the streets in \"nasty woman\" t-shirts, and drawn many into activism for the first time. Of course needlessly inflammatory rhetoric on the right helped push people there.\n\nChas Licciardello posits that it is impossible to understand the mechanism by which people on one side are driven into the other's arms without using the word \"tribe.\"\n\nHe writes that politics today is less ideological than tribal:\n\nSo when Trump takes over the Republican tribe, the supposed ideology of that tribe immediately goes about transforming itself to incorporate Trump's ideology. People who two years ago were passionately pro free trade and \"candidate rectitude\" are now protectionist and feel candidate morality is irrelevant... people perceive news through the lens of their particular tribe and its biases. These strong tribal ties also mean that if someone joins a tribe because of one or two common characteristics or beliefs, they are likely to be quickly socialised into that tribe. Many of their other characteristics and beliefs will become harmonised. That doesn't mean Stepford-style conformity. But cognitive dissonances are likely ironed out, so potential unnecessary conflicts are erased.\n\nHe goes on to argue that some affinities are more powerful than others. \"If I happen to like country music,\" he writes, \"that is unlikely to turn me into a Republican, all other things equal. But if I happen to be really into gun rights and the pro-life agenda, I am very likely to end up culturally a Republican in every respect.\"\n\nThe most powerful affinity of all, he posits, is shared resentment:\n\nWhen two people hate the same groups, they can build an extremely strong relationship without even noticing that they disagree on almost everything else.\n\nHow does all this apply to the matter at hand?\n\nWe are in a period of great political upheaval, so traditional tribal alignments are being shaken up. There are a lot of free agents floating around, ready to be realigned. In this context, a Liberal encounters a moderate conservative. The Liberal alienates the conservative. The first thing that does is ensure the conservative will NOT join the liberal's tribe. It removes any chance of socialisation with the left occurring over time.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean they'll join the Trump tribe:\n\nMaybe that conservative resents tribes... But in the vast majority of instances that will not be the case, and that conservative will remain receptive to other tribes.There are many tribes that conservative could find themself bonding with. Maybe they will end up in the academic, security-focussed, NRO-conservative bubble. Maybe they'll end up in the paleocon Daniel Larison-type conservative bubble. Maybe they'll end up in the economic reforming Ponnuru/Lanhee Choi type conservative bubble. Maybe they'll end up in the Reason-oid soft libertarian type bubble.\n\nOne thing you know for sure, though, is this moderate conservative will be nursing a fresh resentment of Liberals, and will be likely to bond with people who are also nursing a resentment of Liberals. The stronger those people resent Liberals, the more likely this newly aggrieved individual will be to bond with them. And some of the strongest resentments towards Liberals are found in the alt-right/MAGA wing of conservatism. So what these Liberals have done is to reduce the chances of that conservative being socialised with liberals to zero.\n\nAnd they have increased the chances of that conservative being socialised with MAGA-heads from close to zero to a substantially higher number. It could be 5%. It could be 30%. Whatever that chance is, it's a lot more than it was. Because the MAGA-heads and the conservative now have a super-powerful social lubricant, thanks to the Liberals.\n\nIt has nothing to do with \"oh you called me alt-right, so i'm going to hate Jews.\" It's more like, \"you told me to fuck off, so i went looking for new friends. I found some friends who agreed that you are a dick. And we're getting along well now. I don't care what they think about other stuff, they are my friends and we have fun together.\" And then, 6 months later, it's \"I'm not on board with that Jew-hating stuff, but my new friends are spot on about the budget and bias at CNN.\" And then 6 months later, it's \"My new friends are also right about X, Y, Z. Man Liberals are so stupid. How can they not see X, Y and Z?\" And before you know it that person who was once receptive to liberal ideas is now 95% alt-right.\n\nI'd characterize the mechanism that this reader proposes as unproven but quite plausible. And it ought to provoke introspection among those of you who say, \"If someone joined the alt-right based on what the left said they were headed there regardless.\"\n\nAre you sure?\n\nA related mechanism that another Redditor describes is worth considering:\n\nIt's not that calling someone an alt-righter for saying non-PC things will push someone to the alt-right. That might be a problem for a tiny minority, but I honestly don't think that is a real concern that will affect most people.\n\nThe real problem, IMHO, is that when you make expressing reasonable viewpoints so taboo that people are afraid to speak about them openly, it forces any discussion about those issues to move out into fringe circles, and those fringe circles are where people espouse viewpoints that are actually dangerous... Consider the fairly self-evident notion that when it comes to sexual misconduct there's a spectrum of misbehavior, from fairly benign to utterly vile. Is it really so outrageous to suggest that idea that one deserves to be pilloried in the media until they apologize for it?\n\nIn the same way that putting marijuana and LSD into the same category as meth and heroin forces people to go to seedy areas and deal with unscrupulous people to indulge in something fairly innocuous, making legitimate viewpoints so verboten forces many conversations around those ideas to move towards less reasonable circles. Once there, people run a far greater risk of getting caught up in ideas which are truly reprehensible.\n\nA thorny case of leftist rhetoric and its effects comes from a reader who begins by characterizing himself: \"I am a liberal, politically active, middle-aged white male and live in Oakland, the heartland of the political left.\" He wrote about the term \"white privilege\" as it is used in his community. \"I appreciate the attempt to create self-reflection and awareness of the relative treatment experienced by many minorities,\" he explained, but \"without going into personal details of my life, I can assure anyone that I have enjoyed very little of what I would refer to as any type of 'privilege.' It is the epitome of a generalization that is over-inclusive... To reduce all white people's understanding of the experience of any other race as nothing more than the experience of privilege invites a dangerous duality that will provide little benefit to the progressives who think they are enlightening the world instead of benighting it.\"\n\nIn his telling, \"the incessant use of the term 'white privilege' has led to a large number of arguments and alienated me from many progressive friends and colleagues, with semantics essentially pushing me to the right as you noted in your article.\"\n\nNow, without more details, it is hard to know whether this reader is being oversensitive to reasonable characterizations or responding understandably to folks who are misusing the privilege framework as a cudgel and indulging in pernicious stereotypes. I could sketch hypotheticals that would fit either conclusion.\n\nPerhaps his acquaintances should keep talking just as they are anyway. Really. I've defended the privilege framework as one of many useful if imperfect lenses for understanding the world, and recommended Peggy McIntosh's essay setting it forth. Insofar as people trying to accurately describe reality believe they can best do so by invoking white privilege, they ought to keep on doing so, whether they happen to be right or wrong, regardless of whether or not some observers are alienated.\n\nAt the same time, everyone invoking the concept should take care to avoid the pitfalls inherent in any broad racial generalization. And those who invoke the term with the motivation of advancing social justice would do well to consider all the ways it could do more to retard than advance their desired ends. One nuanced treatment of these matters is The Perils of Privilege by Phoebe Maltz-Bovy, an advocate for social justice who is sympathetic to the ends of those who invoke the framework but ultimately concludes that there are some better alternatives on offer.\n\nA reader from Tucson writes:\n\nI eagerly await your article that is titled:\n\n\"How Prolific & Constant Lying By the Right Irritates Everybody Else & Is Bad for America: What Will Make Them Stop Making Shit Up? Why Are They Such Babies When Challenged by Reality?\" But I am not holding my breath.\n\nI'd hate to leave any Arizonan waiting to exhale.\n\nAnd fortunately, I've already published articles as responsive to this one's concerns as \" Sean Hannity Failed to Tell His Viewers the Truth ,\"  \" Trump's Brazen, Effective Lie ,\" \" The False Accuser in Chief ,\" \" Breitbart's Astonishing Confession ,\" \" The Bad Faith of James O'Keefe ,\" \" Trump Didn't Tell the Truth on Russia ,\" \" Faking Toughness on Terrorism ,\" \" Scott Adams' Nihilistic Defense of Donald Trump ,\" and \" Why Donald Trump's Russia Denials Can No Longer Be Believed .\"\n\nFinally, a critic writes:\n\nThere's also, notably, absolutely no call to \"the right\" in this article. The onus for civility and reasonableness and charity and good will is entirely on the left in his telling of it. He argues that assigning blame isn't the point, but the entire article assigns all of the blame to \"the left.\" Every paragraph is a tsk-tsk about how \"the left\" needs to be more accurate and reasonable about their critiques of the right and the alt-right.\n\nNot once does Friedersdorf mention that, hey, maybe Republican politicians or writers at the National Review should reconsider their blanket condemnations and misrepresentation of SJWs or liberals or progressives--in this telling, \"the left\" bears this responsibility in isolation.\n\nLongtime readers know I've always been among the most outspoken critics of the worst failures in movement conservatism ( National Review in the Trump era is not among them!).\n\nAs for the alt-right, the critic treats criticism like a bullet at a shooting range: one aims, fires, and destroys a clay pigeon. But I've long regarded criticism as more of a crucible. I've always hoped my advice to the left and right strengthens each into the best version of itself, believing that a thriving country needs both to be healthy. There is a reason that I have not offered strategic advice to the alt-right about how to better win converts or sustain its future: I believe the alt-right to be a substantively bigoted, irredeemable ideological movement. I want its loyalists to defect even as it is utterly weakened by its adversaries in America's left and right coalitions."

      "text": "America's Corporate Tragedy\n\nA boy has died in a poultry processing plant, and a hashtag is no response.\n\nI was a child soldier in the California grape strikes, my labors conducted outside the Shattuck Avenue co-op in Berkeley. There I was, maybe 7 or 8 years old, shaking a Folgers coffee can full of coins at the United Farm Workers' table where my mother was garrisoned two to three afternoons a week. I did most of my work alongside her, but several times an hour I would do what child soldiers have always done: served in a capacity that only a very small person could. I'd go out in the parking lot and slip between cars to make sure no one was getting away without donating some coins or signing a petition. I'd pop up next to a driver's-side window and give the can an aggressive rattle. I wasn't Jimmy Hoffa, but I wasn't playing any games either.\n\nMy parents were old-school leftists, born in the 1920s and children during the Great Depression. They would never, ever cross a picket line, fail to participate in a boycott, lose sight of strikers' need for money when they weren't getting paychecks. My parents would never suggest that poverty was caused by lack of intelligence or effort. We were not a religious family (to say the least), but I had a catechism: One worker is powerless; many workers can bring a company to its knees.\n\nWhat I'm describing, of course, is a lost world, glimpsed only through history books or the memories of old people. It was a world already in the midst of death even as I was pumping fresh second-grade life into it. The great labor strikes of the late 19th and early 20th centuries-of steelworkers, textile workers, railroad workers, coal miners - were in the past. Union membership peaked at 35 percent of the U.S. workforce in 1954. By the grape strike in 1965, it was already down to 28 percent. A decade and a half later, the former president of the Screen Actors Guild, Ronald Reagan, put collective bargaining in the dustbin of history by ordering striking air-traffic controllers back to work, and when they didn't go back, he fired them. Today only 10 percent of workers have union protections.\n\nUnions faltered for many reasons. Occupational Safety and Health Administration laws and various regulations forced companies to conform to standards of workplace safety or face serious penalties, and most states passed a minimum (subsistence) wage. And Americans are crap socialists, forever lighting out for the territory in the spirit of rugged individualism you hear so much about on truck commercials. Many of the biggest American corporations, such as Amazon, have become world-class union busters. As Cesar Chavez himself pointed out, repeatedly, large-scale immigration makes it all but impossible to keep a union together. Desperate people don't make the terrible journey to this country to go on strike. They do it so they can send money to their impoverished families as quickly as possible.\n\nBut the real reason union membership is so low in this country is globalization. What that word means for Americans is that corporations found the ultimate means of union busting: They sent the jobs away. Good jobs that usually paid well in a union shop, and that once upon a time allowed one parent to support a family-they got sent to China and India and Mexico and Bangladesh, places where people will work for far less money and with far fewer \"demands.\"\n\nAll of this means that we have two or more generations of Americans who have no idea how labor politics work, and who believe that #boycotts are as effective as the real thing.\n\nIn 2018, two Black men were arrested at a Philadelphia Starbucks on suspicion of \"trespassing,\" which ignited one of the many attempts to #BoycottStarbucks that have taken place over the years. It may have been the most successful of these efforts, in that it spurred the company to relax its policy regarding using the cafės and their bathrooms without buying anything. But the boycotters had no real power because nobody stopped buying Starbucks, which was apparently just a bridge too far. #Boycott the place, yes. Ankle it up the block to Peet's? Come on. Starbucks eventually helped the boycotters out by staging a kind of self-boycott, closing thousands of stores for an afternoon of anti-bias training and thereby contributing a few hours of lost sales to the cause.\n\n#BoycottChickFilA-initiated in reaction to the owner's disapproval of gay marriage-began more than a decade ago, during which time the company has only grown. There are principles and there is the Spicy Chicken Sandwich, and one of them has got to give. Now there's a counterinsurgency of Chick-fil-A #boycotters (it has something to do with \"DEI = bad\"), so conservatives and liberals can find common ground in cramming their mouths full of deep-fried chicken while #boycotting the company that makes it.\n\nThe same is true about #BoycottGillette and #BoycottNike. These #boycotts weren't about labor disputes. They were about commercials and the perception that American corporations were in the pocket of \"woke\" leadership. They were puny and powerless. And they are the only kind of boycott that millions of young people have taken part in.\n\nThis is why the sweeping success of the boycotts of Bud Light and Target this spring has so many leftists confused and angry and hurt. Activists on the right deployed the old union tactic for frivolous causes, and it worked. Bud Light lost a quarter of its sales. Target lost more than $13 billion in market cap. All of us associate boycotts with some of the greatest fights of the past century-the Montgomery bus boycott, or the UFW boycotts and strikes. But a boycott has no inherent moral position. It's just a strategy.\n\nThe seeds of both recent boycotts were similar, and ultimately had to do with the growing visibility of transgender people in mainstream culture. Bud Light engaged Dylan Mulvaney, a trans influencer, to make a 50-second promotional video released only on her Instagram account. Target's annual display of Pride merchandise included a kind of women's swimsuit that could disguise a penis. The display also had children's clothes, which rang alarm bells for many conservatives.\n\nThe boycotts themselves aren't in any larger sense meaningful. Some men started drinking different brands of beer. So what? Some Target shoppers started going to Walmart. So what? You can buy whatever you want and you can not buy whatever you want. As every episode of Mad Men proved, people have deep and powerful associations with the brands they like, associations that have much more to do with advertising than with the relative merits of the products. Forget Don Draper; listen to Mick Jagger:\n\nHe can't be a man\n\n'Cause he doesn't smoke\n\nThe same cigarettes as me.\n\nIt's a big country, and people think and feel all kinds of things.\n\nWhat is meaningful are the threats of violence that quickly accompanied the boycotts. On May 24, Target announced that it would be removing some of the Pride items because of \"threats impacting our team members' sense of safety and well-being while at work.\" It was a cautiously worded statement, and some couldn't help but wonder whether Target was just weaseling a way to appease boycotters.\n\nThen, in mid-June, Target stores in five states had to be evacuated because of bomb threats sent to local media outlets, many of which contacted the police. It seemed at first that this was the realization of the chain's dark intimations about the far right. The truth was more complicated. A Vermont police chief said the threats included emails accusing Target of betraying the LGBTQ community . In Louisiana, a local news station reported on the email it received, which called the company \"pathetic cowards who bowed to the wishes of far right extremists.\"\n\nY ou could tell how utterly confusing all of this is to the left by the response of the liberal press.  A Washington Post opinion piece revealed that the writer was game for the fight but deeply confused about the terms of engagement: \"The free market is telling right-wingers something they refuse to hear: Transgender people exist, and they buy stuff.\" But Target's huge loss of market cap wasn't the result of transgender people boycotting. It was the result of anti-transgender people boycotting. And the literal definition of the free market is the ability of consumers to shop wherever they want. The writer was on the right side of history but the wrong side of The Wealth of Nations .\n\nThere was also a counterfactual attempt to posit that the precipitous decline in Target's stock was unrelated to the boycotts. CNN Business published an article called \"Here's the Real Reason Target's Stock Is Dropping,\" which located a mix of factors to explain the sudden development, \"including broader changes in the US economy, the possibility of a recession, and Target's over-exposure to discretionary merchandise.\" (\"Hey, Smitty, short Target for me. I think on Wednesday, shoppers are going to freak out about broader changes to the U.S. economy.\")\n\nThe New Republic published an article called \"The Right's War on Brands Is Stupid and Terrifying,\" which bore the characteristic traits of the form: The writer's outrage over the transphobic response forced him to present the boycotts as a heartless attack on defenseless ... corporate America. \"Cross the pissbabies, and your stock price will tank, your quarterly earnings will collapse, and your executives will be fired.\" I haven't encountered rhetoric like his since the Reagan administration. If a sign of the apocalypse is The New Republic fretting about the quarterly earnings and executive job security of a company like Anheuser-Busch, it's time to get in the bunker.\n\nAnheuser-Busch's CEO earns about $12 million a year and its warehouse workers-at least in Southern California, where I live, and which is one of the most expensive regions in the country-start at $18 an hour. Temp warehouse workers must be able \"to work with minimal supervision and in cold temperatures\" and \"to perform the physical requirements of the job.\" Those physical requirements include being able to spend entire shifts loading and unloading trucks in a refrigerated warehouse. The benefits package includes some inspirational language and the promise of \"Free Beer!\" These workers should not earn $18 an hour while their CEO, sitting in ergonomic comfort and temperature-controlled ease, earns $5,700 an hour.\n\nAs for Target, where to start? Its stores are full of fast fashion, well known to be a human-rights and environmental disaster. The differential between its CEO's pay and his workers' pay is similarly shameful.\n\nThe confusion about these boycotts reveals something much larger than an infirm grasp of how the strategy works, and larger, even, than the pain and fear they produced in transgender people and their allies. It's part of something that is so pervasive among Americans, and especially young Americans, that one hardly notices it anymore: the feeling of being powerless against huge forces that they understand to exist far beyond their control, including the questionable-or outright evil-actions of giant corporations.\n\nLast year, The Nation ran an article titled \" Don't Boycott Amazon \": \"They're too big to be hurt by individual consumer choice. Instead, hit them where it really hurts.\" When I first read it, I thought the piece was very funny, but in the months since I've found it poignant. The writer offers a complicated strategy: \"Don't just feel bad when you buy from Amazon. Make it count by kicking in twice as much to the Amazon Labor Union, and let Amazon know why.\" The strategy also involves ... buying Amazon stock. Jesus wept.\n\nYou could say that this writer would be well served by brushing up on the fundamentals of microeconomics and the institutes of logic. But it was the personal example of her sense of powerlessness against the machine that got my attention. She says that she'd been avoiding shopping on Amazon but then she slipped. Her cat's veterinarian had recommended a certain product and had sent her an Amazon link to it, which the writer used to buy it: \"Immediately, I felt the anger and guilt that comes with trying to be a person of conscience in a culture of pathological convenience. And I felt foolish for imagining that ethical consumerism can do anything other than temporarily assuage those feelings.\"\n\nThat's the sign of a demoralized person, one who feels herself to have no agency at all.\n\nWe haven't left these young people much. Many of them are so terrified about global warming that they believe that bringing a child into this world would be wrong. The retreat from religion has perhaps unburdened many of them from unfounded claims-but what has replaced it? What provides a community of shared belief, social outreach, the sense of living for some larger purpose? Nothing. What is the reliable path into the middle class, one that requires only a willingness to work hard? It's gone. Corporate America sent it away.\n\nThe Bud Light and Target boycotts have been the most successful American-consumer boycotts in a quarter century. They made two large companies sustain serious material losses. That isn't cause for more ennui or alienation. It's a beacon: It can be done. And it should be done.\n\nI said that one of the reasons that union membership had dried up is that OSHA had made workplaces safer. But as this article was closing, a 16-year-old boy was killed while working at the Mar-Jac Poultry processing plant in rural Mississippi. According to The New York Times , Duvan Tomas Perez died \"after becoming ensnared in a machine he was cleaning.\"\n\nHis family posted an obituary describing him as having been a student at N. R. Burger Middle School, the mission of which is to \"educate all students to become productive citizens of a dynamic, global community.\"\n\nOn Saturday he will be buried. The obituary noted the date of the visitation and that \"a Mass of Christian Burial will follow at 11:30 a.m.,\" at Sacred Heart Catholic Church.\n\nI am the resurrection and the life;\n\nhe who believes in me, though he die,\n\nyet shall he live, and whoever lives\n\nand believes in me shall never die.\n\nMy mother knew Cesar Chavez, which was one of the reasons she was so committed to his cause. And now, a literal lifetime later, a Central American boy has been killed on a factory floor and his education, his future, his life ended in what must surely have been an event of overwhelming terror and pain, dying in the same pitiless place where the chickens are killed.\n\nAnd do you know what the company had to say about his death? It was, of course, a \"tragedy,\" but it wasn't the company's fault: \"It appears, at this point in the investigation, that this individual's age and identity were misrepresented on the paperwork.\"\n\nDo you know what I say to that?\n\nStrike.\n\nBoycott.\n\nShut it down."

      "text": "Leftists Use the Trump Playbook to Paint Biden as Senile\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nWith little time to reverse the course of the Democratic primary , leftist and independent-minded critics of Joe Biden have ramped up insinuations about the former vice president's mental state, going so far as to insist that the matter will doom the party in the general election.\n\nThe attacks are remarkable not just for the degree they copy the current Republican playbook against Biden but for how they take a topic that was taboo in past cycles and-without any verification-make it a centerpiece of efforts to blunt his momentum. Coming after the former VP wrested the lead from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) following the primaries on Super Tuesday, it suggests that the closing chapter of the Democratic primary could turn into a deeply personal and politically nasty affair.\n\nIndeed, some Sanders supporters have been blunt about their desire to gin up chatter about Biden's mental state to derail him. In an episode of the popular leftist podcast Chapo Traphouse released Thursday, the hosts openly discussed how best to use the \"senility\" attack against the former vice president.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"I'm sorry, he's senile... his brain is not all there,\" Chapo co-host Will Menaker said.\n\nFellow co-host Amber A'Lee Frost urged Sanders supporters to use questions about Biden's mental state selectively, raising questions about Biden's support for Social Security when dealing with older voters instead.\n\n\"Now we go negative, but I think there's going to have to be a two-front thing,\" she said. \"Because the 'Biden is crackers' thing isn't going to work on his base, who are themselves also crackers.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Sanders himself was asked if he felt Biden was \"up to the task in terms of the rigors of being either the Democratic nominee or being the president.\" The Vermont senator didn't endorse the idea that Biden was physically incapable of the job. But he didn't aggressively beat down the chatter either. \"Joe Biden is a friend of mine,\" said Sanders, in an appearance on CNN's State of the Union . \"And Joe and I have disagreements on the issue. I do not make personal attacks on Joe.\"\n\nOne day earlier, the hashtag WhereIsJoe began trending on Twitter as Biden critics pushed the idea that the campaign was putting him out of sight in order to hide evidence of his supposed cognitive decline. It was a curious effort, not just because there is no direct evidence to support the charge but because Biden had events throughout the weekend. That, however, hasn't stopped the attacks from spreading.\n\n\"Biden is either near senile or actually senile,\" Cenk Uygur, the founder of left-wing online news outlet The Young Turks, said in a video after Biden upended the race on Super Tuesday (and as Uygur reeled from his own loss in a House primary). \"Watch any of the tapes! His mental faculties are under question.\"\n\nIntercept Washington bureau chief Ryan Grim highlighted a clip of Fox News host Sean Hannity calling Biden \"completely incapable of remembering basic fundamental facts\" and asked how Biden would handle questions about his mental stability if he wins the nomination. Outspoken Biden critic and pugnacious economic populist Matt Stoller claimed that Biden's mental decline is an open secret in Washington.\n\n\"They joke about it,\" Stoller wrote of Washington insiders. \"They don't care.\"\n\nSerious question for Biden supporters: How do you counter this narrative in a general election? https://t.co/HEPKqYLOnr\n\nDemocratic insiders know Biden has cognitive decline issues. They joke about it. They don't care.\n\nAnd as the weekend progressed, several others got in on the act, including The Intercept's Glenn Greenwald and 2016 Green Party candidate Jill Stein.\n\nBiden's lies & record are bad enough, but the biggest risk is his obvious cognitive decline. He said he's running for Senate, confused wife & sister, forgot Obama's name etc. This isn't going away. If Dems close their eyes & keep pushing Joe, it'll be an agonizing 8 months ahead.\n\nPrior to the 2016 election, speculation about the mental health of a presidential candidate was frowned upon, as anyone doing so would be operating without primary knowledge of the subject matter. That changed when Donald Trump began having success on the campaign trail, prompting his opponents, and some medical professionals, to abandon the informal rule against such speculation.\n\nThe Biden campaign didn't respond to a request for comment. But there is no documentation that Biden's critics can point to to base their accusations of a diminished mental state. In December, the campaign released medical records that described Biden as \"fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.\" The medical records didn't describe Biden as suffering from any mental issues.\n\nBut Sanders' supporters have keyed in Biden's seemingly limitless capacity for producing embarrassing moments on the campaign trail as a sign that Biden faces a unique liability in the general election and may not even be physically capable of running. Just last week, Biden garbled a quotation from the Declaration of Independence and botched the introductions of his sister and wife in his Super Tuesday victory speech. Ahead of his South Carolina win, Biden told a crowd , wrongly, that he was running for the Senate.\n\nIt has not been uncommon for Fox News and other pro-Trump media outlets, as well as Trump and his family members too, to jump on these often uncomfortable clips. But now they've been joined by more left-leaning critics of the former VP, the more direct of whom use them to question Biden's capacity for the job, the less direct of whom argue that they will be used against him in the same way that video of Hillary Clinton falling at a 9/11 event was used against her in the 2016 campaign.\n\nI will protect your Social Security and Medicare, just as I have for the past 3 years. Sleepy Joe Biden will destroy both in very short order, and he won't even know he's doing it!\n\nThe debate about Biden's mental state recalls the years-long discussion about Trump's own mental state, which has been fueled by his own garbled remarks at rallies and insiders' bizarre descriptions of his behavior. Those discussions brought renewed attention to the American Psychiatric Association's \"Goldwater Rule,\" which discourages members from publicly speculating about the health conditions of public figures from afar.\n\nStill, not everyone is willing to follow the Goldwater Rule. Psychologist John Gartner, who founded a PAC calling for Trump's removal via the 25th Amendment on grounds of mental unfitness, said he doesn't think Biden is suffering from mental deterioration. Instead, Gartner attributes Biden's gaffes on the debate stage to Biden's struggle with stuttering .\n\n\"He knew that the clock's ticking and he's not completing the sentence, he's not completing the thought,\" Gartner said.\n\nBecause Biden has struggled with public appearances for decades, Gartner said, his most recent round of embarrassing clips don't necessarily signify mental decline.\n\n\"I'm not seeing any dramatic, clinical signs,\" Gartner said.\n\nComplicating the leftist attacks against Biden's health is that Sanders faces a round of health-related questions and speculation of his own. The senator survived a heart attack in October. And despite once committing to releasing comprehensive medical records, the Sanders campaign still hasn't disclosed all of the senator's medical information. Instead, the campaign released three letters from doctors who examined Sanders after his heart attack, with one doctor writing that Sanders has \"the mental and physical stamina\" to be president.\n\nHi, my name is @BernieSanders . I'm almost 80 and I just had a heart attack. I'm running to be the leader of the free world but I won't show you my medical records. I know I said I would. But then again you're accustomed to a President making promises he doesn't keep.\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nWilliam.Sommer@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Leftists Use Bad History to Argue Against NATO Intervention\n\nOn March 2, Intercept co-founding editor Jeremy Scahill posted a Twitter thread condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine , while also arguing that the United States and NATO were \"in a dubious position to claim moral high ground in condemning Russia's actions.\"\n\nScahill accused NATO of \"similar or identical acts\" of war crimes during the 1999 bombing of Serbia and Montenegro, a campaign launched in response to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosević's attacks against the Albanian population of Kosovo, who were fighting for their independence.\n\nDuring the 78 day NATO bombing of Serbia and Montenegro in 1999, the US-led NATO alliance committed similar or identical acts that it is now condemning Russia for in Ukraine.\n\nSince then, both Scahill and MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan , who retweeted the thread, have been criticized by some political scientists and ex-diplomats for downplaying Milosević's crimes against humanity to frame NATO as little more than a defender of Western imperialism.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNot only does this narrative ignore the reasons for NATO's intervention in the Balkans, but it's a dishonest way of trying to convince the public that NATO shouldn't intervene in Ukraine .\n\nThe Kosovo War was one of many conflicts in the Balkans during the 1990s, all resulting from the breakup of the communist Yugoslavian state. Beginning with the 1991 Ten-Day War, Milosević and the largely-Serbian Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) waged war against the states that declared independence from the former Republic of Yugoslavia-including Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The JNA committed gross violations of human rights , including mass rapes and ethnic cleansing. Most infamous of all was the 1995 Srebrenica genocide, in which more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys were slaughtered.\n\nMilosević and the JNA launched their first attack on Kosovo in February 1998, in response to the territory's growing independence movement led by the Kosovo Liberation Army. NATO, with the backing of the United States, negotiated a ceasefire in October 1998. But the resumption of violence in December and the failure to reach a peace agreement led to NATO's decision to launch a series of airstrikes on Yugoslavia on March 24, 1999. The strikes were led by U.S. General Wesley Clark and a NATO spokesperson summed up the plan as \"Serbs out, peacekeepers in, refugees back.\" Milosević surrendered on June 11, after 78 days of airstrikes.\n\nNATO's bombardment, and the United States' role throughout the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s are often held up to this day as an example of successful humanitarian intervention. That is not to say they were flawless. NATO went ahead with the airstrikes without the approval of the United Nations. And as Scahill points out, there were terrible instances of civilians and journalists killed by NATO's intervention.\n\nThen-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan expressed mixed feelings about the alliance's decision, but understood why it was made. \"It is indeed tragic that diplomacy has failed,\" Annan said , \"but there are times when the use of force may be legitimate in the pursuit of peace.\"\n\nIf Scahill and Hasan wanted to question whether airstrikes are justified without UN approval, that would be part of a legitimate debate. Instead, they cherry-pick NATO's mistakes, some of which are inevitable in the fog of war, to argue that the intervention was just a form of Western imperialism. Then, they apply the same logic to the situation in Ukraine.\n\nBut ahistorical Twitter threads are merely a symptom of a greater problem: over the past 20 years, many prominent far-left journalists and intellectuals have revealed a grievous blind spot towards the wars in ex-Yugoslavia.\n\nLinguist and left-wing activist Noam Chomsky has repeatedly stated that Milosević's actions were less severe than NATO said. In 2003, he endorsed journalist Diana Johnstone's book Fool's Crusade , a revisionist history of the Yugoslav wars that denies the Srebrenica genocide and questions the authenticity of events like the 1999 Račak Massacre , in which 45 Kosovar Albanians were killed by Serbian guards.\n\nWhen Guardian journalist Emma Brockes asked Chomsky about his endorsement, he doubled down on his praise for Johnstone's work, and compared people's advocacy for Balkan intervention to \"old-fashioned Stalinism.\" In 2015, Serbian President Tomislav Nikolic honored the legendary leftist with the Order of Sretenje for his criticisms of NATO's airstrikes in 1999.\n\nIn 1999, Australian journalist John Pilger criticized NATO in the left-wing journal New Statesman , calling the bombardment a \"cowards' war\" and equivocating between Milosević's attacks on Kosovar Albanians and the Luzane bus bombing , in which a NATO bomb struck a bus carrying civilians. In December 2004, he wrote a column calling Kosovo \"a genocide that never was,\" despite the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugsolavia charging Milosević with genocide (along with 65 other counts) in 2002.\n\nIn their attempts to support a larger narrative about interventions and imperialism, these left-wing thought leaders make nuance-free arguments to support a predetermined conclusion that all intervention, regardless of context or intent, is imperialism. Not only does this give their readers permission to ignore the atrocities committed by Milosević and Putin, it's also license to ignore the suffering of the victims themselves. To this day, Serbians are uncovering mass graves of Kosovar Albanians. Where are the angry leftist tweets about that?\n\nWhat's more, their bad faith arguments could potentially make it easier for readers to accept dubious sources of information. Recently, Kremlin media outlet Redfish has spread memes intending to dupe Americans into not supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia. The most infamous of these-a map of Europe and Africa highlighting where airstrikes take place-says, \"Don't let the mainstream media's Eurocentrism dictate your moral support for victims of war.\"\n\nHasan and Scahill are in no way responsible for people sharing Russian propaganda. But when Russian trolls are arguing the same thing you are (during a Russian war of aggression), it calls for a little self-reflection.\n\nIt's good to be vigilantly skeptical of the drumbeat of war, as even the most righteous military intervention can lead to deadly collateral damage. But when you dishonestly omitting relevant facts to make your point, you're not for peace. You're just against one side.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Left-Wing Activists March for Palestine, but Ignore Africa\n\nThe left is largely unanimous in its disgust over the horrific Oct. 7 Hamas terror attacks on Israel , as well as the subsequent brutal, aimless war the Israeli government is waging in Gaza , which has claimed over 28,000 Palestinian lives to date.\n\nHowever, this conflict isn't the only one where lives have recently been lost, property has been destroyed, and American resources are involved.\n\nMany on the left refer to Israel as an \"apartheid state,\" drawing comparisons between the treatment of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank to the living conditions of Black South Africans prior to the early 1990s. While no two circumstances are exactly the same, I understand the comparison-especially since South African officials themselves have made it. But what I don't understand or agree with is the singular focus on Gaza by much of the activist left-to the exclusion of other human-created disasters worthy of our attention and outrage.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere are 35 armed conflicts in Africa, including several in the Sahel, where in some cases there is a direct American military presence. For example, as of December 2023 there were 1,000 U.S. military personnel in Niger , a country that suffered a military coup in July. Many have decried the IDF's carelessness in bombing and shelling United Nations facilities in Gaza , but the attacks in the Sahel on U.N. facilities have been every bit as costly. In fact, MINUSMA, the Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, has been referred to as \"the United Nations' most dangerous peacekeeping mission.\" It left the country for good in December 2023 at the behest of the Malian government.\n\nEthiopian refugees who fled Ethiopia's Tigray conflict arrive by bus from Village Eight transit centre near the Ethiopian border at the entrance of Um Raquba refugee camp in Sudan's eastern Gedaref state, on December 11, 2020.\n\nProtests have taken place around the country in support of Palestinian civilians in Gaza and the West Bank-including 300,000 people marching through Washington, D.C., in November 2023 in support of a ceasefire. Again, I agree that a ceasefire is desperately needed. But there seems to be a hierarchy of concern for my fellow leftists.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was recently called out by Professor Marc Lamont Hill , a man I greatly admire. Hill referred to the president as \"Genocide Joe,\" but I haven't seen him taking the president to task over the $1.9 billion in aid to Ethiopia in 2022 , as that country engaged in its years-long Tigray War between the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments and the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front-a conflict that has left an estimated 600,000 Ethiopians dead )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://globalaffairs.org/research/policy-brief/ethiopia-propping-one-strongman-after-another__;!!LsXw!Vz2dkfIZeyX2xEzonoPcLgeGE8p_lAnCEOCxSVKiHidJYKwYYkL9ssudtfiUz-3mKXJeGCUxIpvV_Uibj-mP$\">estimated 600,000 Ethiopians dead and human rights abuses committed by both sides .\n\nAccording to the U.N.'s World Food Programme, five million Ethiopians were in need of food assistance in 2022 in the Tigray region-which also lacked humanitarian corridors and fuel. I'm sure some of this is beginning to sound familiar, but it got barely a fraction of the attention the need for fuel, food, and humanitarian corridors in Gaza.\n\nYou won't hear much about it in America, but the civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo-the world's deadliest conflict since World War II-continues to rage on. (A group of brave Congolese footballers )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2024/feb/08/dr-congo-squad-protest-for-peace-in-their-country-before-their-afcon-semi-final-video*:*:text=The*20DR*20Congo*20players*20raised,hand*20during*20the*20national*20anthem.__;I34lJSUlJSUlJQ!!LsXw!Vz2dkfIZeyX2xEzonoPcLgeGE8p_lAnCEOCxSVKiHidJYKwYYkL9ssudtfiUz-3mKXJeGCUxIpvV_WF5IHlG$\">Congolese footballers recently enacted a silent protest during an international match this month to raise awareness of the war.) While the 1.9 million displaced Gazans surely deserve our attention and support,  so do the 5.7 million Congolese similarly uprooted since 2022, and the estimated 25.8 million people in the DRC faced with acute food insecurity.\n\nThis instability and poverty exists in a country that contains 80 percent of the world's cobalt which is necessary for lithium batteries. (DRC is also a source of gold, diamonds, and uranium.)\n\nSoldiers of the South Sudan People's Defence Forces (SSPDF) prepare to be deployed to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) after their departure ceremony at the SSPDF Headquarters in Juba on December 28, 2022.\n\nU.S. imports of lithium batteries from China rose by 99 percent in 2022, driven largely by the rising popularity of electric vehicles. The cobalt necessary for those batteries is mined by Chinese companies in the DRC. Those mines often use child labor and exploit workers. The Inflation Reduction Act attempts to free us from dependence on Chinese lithium batteries, but there is room for more advocacy on behalf of Congolese people.\n\nAccording to U.N. reports, Rwanda trains and arms a militia that has wreaked havoc and committed war crimes in the DRC. Despite these damning reports, Rwanda still gets support from the U.S. provided Rwanda with $147 million in foreign aid in 2021 and is the country's largest bilateral benefactor.\n\nWhere's the U.S. left wing on this? Your guess is as good as mine. In places where U.S. policy plays a direct role-the atrocities fail to inspire the same kind of passion among leftist activists. Many are likely completely unaware.\n\nIt is not my intention to criticize protests on behalf of the people of Gaza. They are necessary, and they are correct. But I must ask the question of why other deadly conflicts with ties to European colonialism, imperialism, and exploitation in Africa are not a priority for the American left.\n\nIt's not the right wing that prioritizes global humanitarianism.

      "text": "The Far Left Is Clueless to the Damage Its Pro-Hamas Messaging Is Doing to the Progressive Movement\n\nWhen Hamas , a violent, oppressive, antisemitic, theocratic organization with the stated mission of destroying Israel, intentionally murdered more than 1,400 people-mostly innocent civilians, in addition to many foreign nationals-and took a few hundred hostage, including babies and the elderly, there was only one rational response to this particular incident. Hamas is a reprehensible terrorist group, targeting innocent civilians is always wrong, and Hamas is not synonymous with innocent Palestinian civilians.\n\nRegardless of where you fall on the Israel - Palestine conflict (and I have complicated thoughts on it myself), this should have been an easy position to take. Indeed, many on the left did express solidarity with the Palestinian people by calling for an end to the more than half-century long occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip -while also expressing horror at Hamas' wanton cruelty, sympathy for the survivors and victims' families, and rejecting the notion that this was some kind of great military victory on the road to a \"free Palestine.\"\n\nHowever, in a true \"mask off\" moment, much of the far-left inexplicably chose to explicitly (and without reservation) side with the terrorists. Morality aside, this is a profoundly incompetent, self-serving, narcissistic strategy that will probably set back many left-wing policy goals for the foreseeable future-including the cause for Palestinian self-determination.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs a proud progressive, I cannot remember ever being as angry as I am now with people who claim to care about human rights, except when it comes to Jewish people.\n\nAt Stanford University, an instructor (who is not a full-time faculty member) singled out Jewish students in a course, diminished the severity of the Holocaust, and defended the actions of Hamas due to Israel being a \"colonizer.\" (That instructor has been removed from teaching duties pending an investigation.)\n\nAt Harvard, more than 30 student groups released an open letter blaming the terrorist attack on Israel and siding with Hamas; since then, at least five student groups have withdrawn themselves from the letter following backlash.\n\nA professor at Yale University dismissed the murder of Israeli civilians: \"Settlers are not civilians. This is not hard.\"\n\nLast night, at George Washington University, a group of students projected the phrase \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" on the outside wall of the Gelman Library, which is well-known to be a call for the destruction of Israel, and \"Glory to the Martyrs,\" ostensibly praise for Hamas.\n\nA post shared by StopAntisemitism (@stop_antisemitism)\n\nThis strident, so-called activism-which, in my opinion, does not help the Palestinian cause-goes far beyond college campuses. A day after the horrific terrorist attack against innocent Israeli civilians, the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America organized a rally in Times Square that was so completely devoid of empathy that it drew a sharp rebuke from Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman, two of the organization's most notable electoral accomplishments.\n\nPeople rally  in Times Square in New York on October 8, 2023 after Hamas launched an attack on Israel.\n\nThe Chicago chapter of Black Lives Matter posted a picture of a paraglider, praising Hamas for its attack. (They later deleted it after backlash.) Rallies throughout the country featured inflammatory chants that called for Israel to be destroyed and praised Hamas as \"freedom fighters,\" which is entirely absurd.\n\nI truly wish I could say I'm genuinely surprised by any of this, but after the initial shock of witnessing such callousness, I have to admit it's not all that surprising. For many years, many in the far-left movement-most often describing themselves as \"leftists\" or \"democratic socialists\"-have engaged in unnecessarily divisive behavior toward anyone who disagrees with their methods.\n\nTake the 2020 Democratic primary, for example.\n\nI initially supported Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren 's presidential campaign, believing her progressive vision was backed up with a reasonable political strategy and, far more importantly, that she had the skills and discipline to cobble together a winning coalition in the general election.\n\nWedged between two ideological behemoths-Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) from the far-left and Joe Biden from the center-left-Warren, perceived simultaneously as insufficiently left and also too left, couldn't gather enough support and dropped out after Super Tuesday. I was heartbroken, but there was no hesitation about whom I'd be supporting next. It was clear to me that Joe Biden was the only rational choice.\n\nI didn't switch my support to Biden because I agreed with him on everything, but because his campaign was the only one I trusted to build a coalition necessary to defeat Donald Trump that November. Biden's campaign had done respectful and thoughtful outreach to progressives, never pressuring or shaming us, always being open to thoughtful disagreement and encouraging solidarity despite differences.\n\nOn the other hand, many supporters of Sanders' campaign were quite the opposite: ruthlessly shaming anyone who even slightly disagreed with them. I was much closer to Sen. Sanders in terms of political views than Biden, but I knew there was no way in hell his campaign would be able to do the hard and necessary work of bringing together folks with widely divergent views, whereas the Biden campaign seemed to excel at it.\n\nEven as a staunch progressive, I have never joined DSA or any other far-left group because too many from their ranks consistently mistake purity for integrity, myopia for focus, and shame for solidarity. Don't take my word for it. Read this resignation letter from one of the group's founders, who no longer recognizes the organization he helped start four decades ago.\n\nThis is not true of all folks on the far-left, to be sure. For example, many of them-including Sen. Sanders-immediately called out Hamas for its atrocities.\n\nBut the difference between a good faith leftist and a performative leftist is that the former will always look for ways to bring people of differing views into the movement and the latter will never miss an opportunity to make it clear that they believe the movement should be nothing more than an exclusionary, insufferable book club for people who care far more about engaging in Peak Activist Narcissism than doing the really hard work of building communities and coalitions.\n\nMany on the far-left clearly don't yet realize just how much damage their unapologetic antisemitism (like supporting Hamas' barbaric crimes) has already done to the movement, and how clownishly they've hindered progress to achieve their political goals.\n\nThat's because many of them so often navigate spaces that are unabashedly echo chambers and push out anyone who deviates from that order.\n\nThey have failed to grasp the moral urgency of this moment. That so many of them would shamelessly pretend that there's not enough space to offer for innocent civilians in both Gaza and Israel, or act as though innocent civilians should pay the price for the war crimes of their leaders, is truly infuriating and heartbreaking.\n\nOvernight, much of the far-left has lost the good faith consideration of tens of millions of Americans who cannot fathom what is wrong with these people who defend terrorists. Sadly enough, it's easy to imagine the far-left will be shocked to find their candidates rejected at the ballot box, because they've replaced the empathy that's necessary for being an engaged citizen with an incessant need to be outrageously provocative for little more reason than their own egos.\n\nThere's nothing progressive about that.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "The Best Hope for Peace Is the Israeli Left. Don't Abandon Them.\n\nThe violently frenetic ebbs and flows of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict trick our grasp of time and memory. At one point, many leftists viewed Israel, and their Israeli Labor Party Zionist comrades specifically, with kinship. That seems rather unimaginable today.\n\nIt shouldn't be. The Israeli left is an indispensable natural ally in the struggle for a purportedly shared goal: peace and two states.\n\nCynics and status quo beneficiaries insist it's untimely- delusional -to mention peace, let alone two states, in the throes of war and especially after what the world witnessed on Oct. 7. But the tragedies and traumas of today demand that we sow the seeds for what must come, because Israelis and Palestinians can't return to what was.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIsraelis don't need to wait for an investigation into the Oct. 7 catastrophe to know that a political reckoning is coming. If the past is any prologue, Israelis might ratchet further rightward. But conventional wisdom doesn't take into consideration that Oct. 7 completely unmasked the bankruptcy of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Israeli right's security-through-subjugation doctrine.\n\nA window of opportunity thus emerges for the Israeli left, with the right mix of conviction, strategy, and global solidarity, to catalyze its long-awaited resurrection and reorient Israel's posture toward peace.\n\nMuch is made about the status and stability of the Israeli left-no strangers to the scorn of their own countrymates. Once decades-long power brokers, now largely relegated to agitating from the outside, ridiculed for still having the radical temerity to believe that a saner future, rooted in peace and coexistence, is within striking distance if we have the courage to chase it.\n\nDimmed as it might be by Oslo-esque failures, the spirit of the older generation of peaceniks endures in heroic figures like Yair Golan and ignites the younger generation-embodied by organizations like Standing Together -who've taken up the painstaking mantle of peacebuilding and cross-communal solidarity work.\n\nNo rest for the weary, even in a uniquely dark and devastating chapter in Israeli-Palestinian history.\n\nAn alienated minority within the hostile confines of their own country, Israeli leftists turn to their ideological counterparts internationally in search of solidarity only to be met with a different strain of the same ostracization. While some are simply driven by plain antisemitism or anti-Zionism, the broader pro-Palestinian left disregards this potential ally for reasons of ideological dogma.\n\nMuch of the global left reductively conflates the Israeli left and right as two sides of the same expansionist coin. As a consequence, leftists insist that unconditional solidarity with oppressed Palestinians necessitates shunning their oppressors-without distinction. Others are mired in the mentality that engaging with the Israeli left is tantamount to selling out the Palestinian struggle.\n\nForsaking natural allies in service of maximalist solidarity with Palestinians or out of ideological purity is a strategic mistake. It's also the epitome of cutting off one's nose to spite one's face. One hundred percent ideological harmony even amongst ideological counterparts is illusory. Practically speaking, peace can't even be made by freezing out the other party in the bilateral relationship.\n\nUnlike the right, who makes no apologies for their illiberal alliances, liberals too often find themselves tangled in this web of sanctimony at the expense of building partnerships that translate to power. The frustrating irony is that leftists, by nature, understand that the power of a movement largely rests in its numbers.\n\nThe Israeli left has been fighting for decades-at great personal sacrifice and to much derision-for the same cause the global left has been marching for the past couple months. Peace with Palestinians has long been, and still remains, part and parcel of the Israeli left's ethos. Oct. 7 further crystallized that peace isn't an idealistic liberal rallying cry, as the hawks would patronizingly have you believe, but a moral, ethical, and safety imperative.\n\nRather than our disdain, these imperfect bastions of hope deserve our support.\n\nEmpowering the Israeli left, particularly when Israelis writ large are questioning existing conceptions of safety, lends their message greater credence and naturally strengthens their influence and viability. Their voices, in concert with the global left, and amplified by the megaphone of leftist politicians, become harder to minimize. Disaffected peaceniks traumatized by past tragedies may rediscover hope in a shattered dream. That momentum then has the potential to graduate to political power.\n\nIn reality, the Israeli left's ongoing isolation indirectly does the work of the Israeli right who've been champing at the bit to cement the left's status as historical artifacts. The left's total collapse would clear the way for the right's permanent consolidation of power and the irrevocable implementation of their antidemocratic, annexationist ambitions. The mere utterance of the word \"Palestine,\" let alone \"two-state solution,\" would fall on deaf ears.\n\nThose hoping that this crisis will breed renewed opportunity for peace should aggrandize the folks on the ground fighting for that future. Splintered solidarity is no match for the unsustainable status quo.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Trumpists See 'Loony Leftists' and 'Common-Sense Gun Laws' as the Real Threat After Mass Shootings\n\nGeorge Orwell wrote that \"in our time political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible.\" His words could not better describe far-right conservatives spinning fantastical theories about who and what is to blame for the mass shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio.\n\nTake the members of the right-wing intellectual community who are embarrassing themselves with convoluted and spurious arguments in defense of the president like Julie Kelly, an editor of the Trumpist website American Greatness . While Kelly is perhaps a minor figure in the conservative community, she has been getting much airtime from Sebastian Gorka, one of her major admirers. Like Tucker Carlson , who said on his program Tuesday night that a white nationalist threat \"is just like the Russia hoax,\" Kelly asserts that anti-Trump forces have \"invented another imaginary threat they hope to weaponize against the president... 'white supremacist' terrorism.\" According to Kelly, this \"imaginary threat\" exists only to pressure voters \"into defeating Trump... next year.\"\n\nShe calls conservative writers who do not support her views like National Review writer David French , \"a never Trump promoter of the white supremacist fallacy\" and also objected to National Review editor Rich Lowry's call for the FBI to go after white supremacists like it once went after the Klan. To Kelly, the FBI is led by partisan holdovers from the Mueller-Comey era, which means that of course they too would manufacture a white nationalist threat. The real threat are \"strong-arm tactics that will... violate the free speech\" of Americans. She actually fears that Republicans and even the president could be banned from social media for tweets that others say help the racists.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEven more shocking is the lengthy analysis in Frontpagemag.com -the website of the David Horowitz Freedom Center-by historian and American classicist Bruce Thornton , who is also a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and a Shillman Fellow at the Horowitz organization. Author of many books, Thornton is a smart man who should know better. Yet he argues that it is only the progressives who are \"politicizing the murders,\" claiming that while the bodies of the victims of the shootings lay in the morgue the \"progressive 'carrion-picking crows' started to politicize the murders.\"\n\nThornton goes on to claim that its a lie that gun control laws of any kind will lessen such murders, pointing to among other things, the failure of Prohibition. If someone is determined to get a gun they will do so, he says, ridiculing Democrats presidential candidates who want to pass \"common-sense gun safety legislation.\" According to him, those words\"have become anti-gun-nut mantras designed to exploit the suffering of the victims and the ghoulish spectacle of the crimes.\" One wonders if he thinks regulations on drivers of cars have made the roads safer.\n\nAnother lie, according to Thornton, is the \"sinister power of 'white nationalism.' \" You cannot call it that, he writes, because it is the same phenomenon that Boston Brahmins like Henry Cabot Lodge backed in the 1920s. As he points out, these establishment Republicans of their era favored \"racial purity,\" eugenics and the restrictive immigration law of 1924 that limited arrivals from Eastern and Southern Europe. Certainly, the arguments to keep out Jews and Italians from the United States were very similar to the racist theories today about Mexicans and others coming from \"shithole countries,\" as our president referred to them; Trump would much prefer our immigrants to come from Northern Europe.\n\nEven if the shooter is a white nationalist, Thornton argues, he is not part of \"a larger, organized group with any national following or influence;\" simply a \"deranged loner\" whose fantasies and actions \"do not bespeak a widespread 'white nationalist' threat.\" He notes that the Klan today numbers perhaps 6,500, nothing compared to the four million who belonged to it in 1920. While his statistics are correct about the Klan, he ignores how ideologies are propagated in the digital age. As David French puts it, today \"the deadly challenge comes from a connected, radical, online-organizing community of vicious white- terrorists [who are] every bit as evil as jihadists\" and who \"radicalize in much the same way.\" Loners are perhaps the most vulnerable.\n\nUsing the same analysis as Julie Kelly, Thornton insists that there is simply no white nationalist threat, despite the fact that FBI Director Christopher Wray told Congress that the Bureau \"made about 100 arrests for domestic terrorism in the first three quarters of this year-and most were linked to some form of white supremacy.\" And that anyone who points out that fear and division are emanating from the White House, as do Jay Inslee, Pete Buttigieg, and now Joe Biden, are \"Trump-hating Democrat primary candidates\" peddling a meme that Trump is a racist.\n\nIndeed, lawyer and author Joseph Klein writes in Frontpagemag that \"loony leftists\" are trying to smear Trump and to blame the shooting on \"the lack of effective gun control measures.\" So, if you are among an ever-growing group of Americans who favor a ban on heavy round magazines for military-style rifles, and a ban on the sale of those weapons, you are per se a \"loony leftist\" to Klein.\n\nWhat I find truly loony, however, is the claim that \"Trump has tried to bring the country together in the wake of the weekend mass shootings,\" and will actually follow through on his call for \"bipartisan solutions to address the underlying causes\" of mass shootings, which he claims are mental illness and the glorification of violence in video games, \"reinforced by hateful social media sites.\"\n\nJust don't expect our president to champion background checks and legislation to outlaw the use of military-style weapons, policies that just might minimize the number of people injured or killed in the next mass shooting.\n\nronradosh23@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "The Left Needs a Better Message on Crime\n\nLast week's election was a grim reminder of how much juice conservatives get from putting crime at the forefront of voters' minds.\n\nSure, Democrats are jubilant about holding onto their paper-thin Senate majority-but they lost the House . That happened in large part because, while the \"red wave\" turned out to be more of a red trickle in the country as a whole, there were parts of New York state where the election results really were a bit like the scene where the elevator doors open in The Shining .\n\nRepublicans took all the House seats on Long Island, made huge inroads in the suburbs north of New York City, and Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul won a way-too-close race against a wacky election denier. The Republican campaign in New York was all about crime-and it was mostly a winner for them.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nProgressives, for their part, often seem unsure how to address the issue-especially the kind of progressives who are closest to my democratic socialist politics. All too often, the left's instinct is to run away from talking about it or even to dismiss anyone who expresses concern about violent crime as a purveyor of \"copaganda.\"\n\nA better approach would be to take working-class people's very real concerns about public safety seriously, stop trading in libertarian rhetoric about getting better public services by slashing funding levels-which makes no more sense when it comes to proposals to \"defund the police\" than it does in any other area. Instead, they should focus on the core message that the most effective way to reduce the crime rate in the long run is by creating a more equal society where everyone's material needs are met.\n\nSens. Edward Kennedy, Strom Thurmond, Joe Biden, and Paul Laxalt look at the 1984 crime bill after it passed.\n\nThe Changing Politics of Crime on the Left\n\nMainstream Democrats were all about lock-'em-up-and-throw-away-the-key \"tough on crime\" policies up until, in the greater scheme of things, about five minutes ago. Vice President Kamala Harris, for example, used to go on and on about what a \"tough prosecutor\" she'd been in California. President Joe Biden once bragged that the original version of the Crime Bill he wrote in 1991 did everything short of \"hanging jaywalkers.\"\n\nThe politics of that issue have dramatically changed in the last few years-especially after the national unrest following the brutal police murder of George Floyd in 2020. That's a good thing.\n\nThe old approach was intimately tied to what's often called \"neoliberalism\"-the revival of a more laissez faire approach to economics even within traditional left and liberal political parties around the world that played out between the 1970s and 1990s. In the United States, instead of building on the Great Society welfare state LBJ had started to build in the 1960s, a bipartisan consensus was formed, which preferred to manage the social ills arising from poverty with a harsher regime of policing and incarceration.\n\nThe extent to which mainstream Democrats have truly reversed course from those \"tough on crime\" policies is, in practice, not always impressive. Even on an issue as wildly popular as marijuana legalization, Biden hasn't actually been able to bring himself to let anyone out of federal prison. (His recent pardon was so narrowly tailored that the only beneficiaries were people who'd already served their time.) But at least Democrats aren't foaming at the mouth about hanging jaywalkers anymore. And at least in some places, reforms have been enacted like the abolition (for most crimes) of cash bail in New York.\n\nPutting aside more centrist Democrats like Biden and Harris, the actual left has pushed much harder on criminal justice reform.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of the congressional \"Squad\" energetically promoted the \"defund the police\" slogan in 2020. Leftists who have been elected to district attorney positions in some cities, like Larry Krassner in Philadelphia or (until recently) Chesa Boudin in San Francisco, have worked overtime to use their prosecutorial discretion to ensure that fewer residents of those cities end up behind bars.\n\nAnd an organization that some of these politicians have been at least loosely aligned with, the Democratic Socialists of America, has gone even further. DSA has gone on record as supporting \"abolition\" of police and prisons-whatever that actually means.\n\nThe Absurdity of \"Abolitionism\"\n\nFull disclosure: I'm a DSA member .\n\nEven if the organization sometimes puts out statements that I find embarrassingly poorly thought-out, the vast majority of its time and energy goes in directions I would sign off on without reservation-like fighting for Medicare for All, pushing for a less hawkish foreign policy, and keeping alive important big-picture ideas about how the economic foundations of our society could be restructured in a more egalitarian direction.\n\nDSA activists have also been involved in important efforts like the unionization drives at Starbucks stores around the country. They'll continue to get my dues money every month.\n\nInmates sit in the county jail on July 26, 2013, in Williston, North Dakota.\n\nBut \"abolitionism\" about policing and prisons really is a shockingly poorly thought-out idea-the kind of thing you only say if you're so far removed from the levers of national power that you feel comfortable never spending a minute thinking about how any of this would work in practice. At least in my experience , \"abolitionists\" are unable to answer the most basic follow-up questions about how public safety would work post-\"abolition.\"\n\nWould vigilantes just informally patrol their neighborhoods-like George Zimmerman was doing when he killed Trayvon Martin? Or would there still be some sort of publicly owned entity in charge of law enforcement? If so, how would such an entity not just be a reformed version of the police? And without some form of imprisonment, no matter how humane and minimalistic, would the only remaining strategy for dealing with violent criminals who pose an ongoing threat to their communities be to kill them?\n\nIf you read, for example, Angela Davis's book on prison abolition, exactly zero of these questions are answered. And any movement that was serious about persuading a majority of the American public would have to come up with answers pithy enough for door-to-door canvassing.\n\n\"Defund the Police\" and the Dilemmas of Local Reform\n\nPerhaps such questions would be moot in an advanced socialist society that might exist in the 23rd century when poverty is something people read about in history books. But in a country like the United States in 2022, where street crime is a real problem many working-class people worry about, \"abolitionism\" sounds like a recipe for private security for rich people and Mad Max for everyone else.\n\nI certainly want less militarized, more accountable police forces and smaller, more rehabilitation-focused prisons. But I'm somewhat skeptical of the idea that we could completely get rid of police and prisons even in the 23rd-century utopia just described.\n\nPolice advance while sending a volley of tear gas toward demonstrators protesting the killing of teenager Michael Brown on Aug. 17, 2014, in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nToo many affluent people are domestic abusers or rapists, for example, for me to believe that economic conditions are the only source of interpersonal violence. But I don't have any trouble believing that the main drivers of violent crime would be dramatically reduced in such a society. We have plenty of real-life evidence that it can be greatly reduced even given steps that take us only a small part of the way there.\n\nNorway, for example, has both a far lower rate of violent crime than we do- and a far more humane criminal justice system. If you believe that it's because the people there are genetically or culturally primed to be nice people who don't do violent things, I'd strongly recommend that you watch Robert Eggers's film The Northman .\n\nThe reason Nordic countries are able to have their cake and eat it too on criminal justice is that strong labor unions and socialist political parties have secured reforms that (even if they fall short of the imaginary 23rd-century paradise)  take their societies in a far more economically just direction. Even if we restrict ourselves to the U.S., there's a reason very few kids of any ethnic background grow up in middle-class suburbs and go on to join street gangs.\n\nThe problem for Americans (like me) who want a more humane and minimalistic criminal justice system is that we don't live in such a society. And the left-the real left-is far too structurally weak right now to take over the levers of power on a national scale to start implementing the reforms that would take us in that direction. But we can sometimes win district attorney elections in deep blue cities. And there we can, on a very small scale, try to chip away at the carceral state.\n\nThe problem is that-given that we live in a society afflicted by poverty, deep economic inequality, and all the social ills that come with those things-even \"defunding\" the police in the sense of reducing budget lines (but not to zero) is extremely unpopular with the working-class people of all races who would form the base of any successful version of the left.\n\nA taped-off area marking the scene of a shooting in Harlem, New York, on Jan. 22, 2022.\n\nA recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that only 17 percent of Black voters want to decrease police funding in their area, twice as many want to increase it, and a majority want to keep it as is.\n\nIn the larger context of a neoliberal hellscape where crime is far worse than it is in places like Norway, reform-minded local DAs trying their best to chip away at the carceral state are often faced with difficult tradeoffs. If you decide not to prosecute a given offender, they might do something violent the next day. Every time this happens, you've added fuel to the fire of right-wing efforts to discredit any efforts at reform. On the other hand, if you decide to err on the side of prosecution and pushing for jail time in every instance, what was the point of electing a reformist DA?\n\nEven a policy as straightforward as ending cash bail is fraught with pitfalls. As a socialist, I abhor the very idea that one suspect could end up rotting in jail while they wait for trial because of a lack of money-while another could go free immediately if they can scrounge up the cash. But the bail reform law in New York creates new problems. In an effort \"to preserve the presumption of innocence and reduce racial biases against defendants\" the law specifically prevents judges from considering \"their subjective view of a person's 'dangerousness' when deciding what release conditions to set.\"\n\nI can understand why legislators were moved to impose that condition. Without it, the reform would have had far less teeth. But with it, the predictable consequence is that sometimes even obviously dangerous suspects have to be put back on the streets, and whenever this leads to bad consequences, the lock-'em-up-and-throw-away-the-key right has a new talking point.\n\nI don't claim to have all the answers to these dilemmas-and to be clear, if I'd lived in Philadelphia or San Francisco, I would have absolutely voted for Krassner or Boudin. I haven't seen convincing statistical evidence that their approach leads to worse results overall than the harsher decisions of more mainstream DAs in comparable cities, and I'd rather err on the side of re-electing people at least trying to do the right thing than empowering cynical opportunists trying to score \"tough on crime\" points.\n\nBut I worry that some of my fellow leftists, who also don't have great answers about how to navigate these tradeoffs, end up lashing out at anyone who raises legitimate concerns about crime by accusing them of spreading \"copaganda.\" While many of the politicians who spent 2020 talking about \"defund\" have quietly dropped )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://badnews.substack.com/p/a-q-and-a-with-aoc-on-the-midterms__;!!LsXw!StKwPKcZKWTBvhVHsphWuNMZVsfPCy09Mi_fkTeQu1Kt_g3iqUc5CI7k3LnPrc-38CGjJZuez6GwIrnbkB8JnYKXwE4$\">quietly dropped that terminology in response to public backlash, they and their supporters still tend to bristle at any criticism of the slogan-and in absence of a more compelling message, they all too often default to just not talking about crime at all. Any expression of alarm over recent upticks in the crime rate is met with the response that the rates is still much lower than it was in decades past.\n\nAs New York magazine's Eric Levitz points out , progressives would rightly reject parallel arguments in other contexts:\n\n<p>Yes, America's murder rate is lower today than it was in the early 1990s. But so is the percentage of Americans who lack health insurance. In 2018, progressives did not lambast the media for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/10/20858938/health-insurance-census-bureau-data-trump\">covering a modest increase</a> in the uninsured rate because things were still better than they'd been in 1998. Rather, we pointed to the negligible uninsured rates of other developed countries, and declared the performance of America's health-care system a persistent scandal. If our nation's uninsured rate should be judged by the standard of other wealthy countries, why shouldn't its murder rate be judged by the same metric?</p>\n\nAs Levitz suggests, a better approach would be to emphasize that many policies the left supports have been proven to reduce the rates of violent crime.\n\nMost obviously, tightening requirements for handgun purchases has \"yielded dramatic reductions in firearm homicide rates.\" More interestingly, policies like minimum wage hikes and increases in the Earned Income Tax Credit that funnel more money to the people who need it most have been shown to reduce recidivism among ex-convicts. Unsurprisingly, given the role of addiction, mental health problems, and financial desperation in fueling various kinds of crime, increased access to healthcare has also been shown to have a salutary effect.\n\nThe left can't afford to cede this issue to our political enemies. And telling working-class people in high crime neighborhoods not to worry about it because the problem used to be even worse is a recipe for disaster. Instead, we should be laser-focused on the simple and true message that America's crime rate is downstream of brutal economic inequality.\n\nThe recipe for safe streets, a human criminal justice system, and a population with hope for the future is to move toward a society that distributes resources more equitably and meets everyone's material needs. That 's the message the left should be shouting from the rooftops.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Left-Wing Defenses of Hamas Are an Insult to Palestinians\n\nOn Oct. 30, a long list of faculty at Columbia University and Barnard College attached their names to an open letter which argued that the murders, rapes, and kidnappings committed by Hamas against Israelis and foreign nationals in Israel-mostly civilians-were a \"military response by a people who had endured crushing and unrelenting state violence from an occupying power over many years.\"\n\nThe open letter is just the latest episode in a broader convulsion of cruel stupidity on the Western left since the atrocities of Oct. 7 .\n\nProtesters celebrated the massacre of young concert attendees in New York. The Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) declared the slaughter of civilians was a \"direct result of Israel's apartheid regime\" and \"not unprovoked.\" An open letter from a \"coalition of Palestine solidarity groups\" at Harvard University announced that Israel is \"entirely responsible for all unfolding violence\" and stated that the \"apartheid regime is the only one to blame.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nUnderneath the outright refusal to condemn an explicitly genocidal organization that just carried out the largest mass murder of Jews since the Holocaust, there are a couple of revealing assumptions. These assumptions-which are obscured by the language of faux anti-imperialism and humanitarian concern-help to explain why otherwise decent people can excuse (and even endorse) the worst crimes imaginable.\n\nThere are two primary reasons so many left-wing activists, students, and professors are incapable of acknowledging that Hamas committed ghastly atrocities in southern Israel.\n\nFirst, there's the conflation of Hamas with the people of Palestine as a whole. The Oct. 30 letter asks readers to consider whether the pogrom in Israel was \"just one salvo in an ongoing war between an occupying state and the people it occupies, or as an occupied people exercising a right to resist violent and illegal occupation\" (italics added). This is a grotesque smear of the majority of Palestinians, who confront endless indignities and deprivations but wouldn't dream of expressing their discontent by gunning down children and grandmothers.\n\nAllowing the most extreme members of a movement or society to function as its representatives isn't just a profound insult to many innocent people-it's also a political disaster.\n\nWhen Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant announced the \"complete siege\" of Gaza, he said: \"We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly.\" Cutting off food, water, and electricity to everyone in Gaza is a brutal form of collective punishment-and one which is much easier to rationalize if the people of Gaza are dehumanized and treated as indistinguishable from Hamas.\n\nThe left should spend its political energy drawing a clear line between the Gazans who just want to protect their families and the theocratic gang that has intentionally put those families in mortal peril.\n\nBut many self-described friends of the Palestinians are doing the opposite.\n\nIt's bad enough when leftists treat Hamas as the authentic voice of the Palestinians, but it's an ugly and dangerous farce when they lavish the organization with praise. This is what former British Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn did when he described Hamas as an \"organization that is dedicated towards the good of the Palestinian people and bringing about long-term peace and social justice and political justice in the whole region.\"\n\nThe second reason many on the left refuse to hold Hamas accountable for the horrors it inflicted on Israeli civilians on Oct. 7 is the long-standing left-wing conviction that anti-Western terrorist organizations have no agency.\n\nRecall the language in the letters and statements above: the attack was a \"direct result of Israel's apartheid regime.\" Israel is \"entirely responsible\" and the \"only one to blame.\"\n\nIt's one thing to assert that the attack was a \"military response\"-a ploy to reframe the slaughter of civilians as self-defense. But it's something quite different to relieve Hamas of responsibility for its actions altogether.\n\nThis is an expression of a fundamental belief on much of the left-that victims of oppression are not self-determined human beings capable of making their own decisions. Just as victims of systemic racism can't hold racist views themselves (the argument goes), victims of what the left has decided is a \"settler colonial\" enterprise couldn't possibly be genocidal imperialists.\n\nSome on the left don't even think Hamas can be blamed for its oppression of other Palestinians-as the British activist Owen Jones recently explained : \"It wasn't actually Hamas who introduced the law banning homosexuality in Gaza. Guess who it was? The British Empire.\"\n\nThe left privileges the status of victimhood over all other aspects of identity. But in the case of Hamas, all you have to do is read its Charter-a horror show of antisemitic paranoia and exterminationist fantasy-to see that the group's obsessive hatred of Jews is a much more salient motivating factor than the restrictions imposed on Gaza.\n\nMillions of Palestinians don't launch rockets at civilians or go on rampages at music festivals and kibbutzim, and many resistance movements throughout history have been nonviolent. Human behavior isn't a product of a single variable like victimhood.\n\nThe two main reasons for the outbreak of moral confusion on the left after Oct. 7 are directly related.\n\nIn the minds of many campus protesters and activists, Hamas and the Palestinians are interchangeable. They're all just victims with brown skin, so they can be haphazardly grouped together. The best among them are no different from the worst. (This conflation of Hamas with ordinary Palestinians is, ironically, exactly what the most vicious anti-Palestinian voices in Israel and on the right do, as well.)\n\nThis isn't even the soft bigotry of low expectations-it's just bigotry, and it will only hurt the people it professes to defend.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Newt Gingrich Claims 'War on the Border' Was Funded by 'Leftists'\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nAmid reports of asylum-seeking migrants being sprayed with tear gas as they tried to cross the U.S. border over the weekend, former speaker of the House Newt Gingrich offered his own unfounded theory for the unrest: American leftists are financing a \"war on the border\" in an attempt to \"embarrass\" the government.\n\n\"This war on the border is real,\" Gingrich insisted Monday morning on Fox & Friends . \"And what people are trying to do is a psychological war, very often guided, by the way, by American leftists who are activists and American left-wing organizations who are helping finance it.\"\n\nThe former Georgia lawmaker appeared to be referencing a popular far-right conspiracy theory that some progressives, including liberal billionaire and political donor George Soros, are financing the migrant caravan for political gain.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn Monday, Gingrich went a step further, insisting the left's goal for mobilizing thousands of Central Americans is to embarrass the U.S. by making it seem like the government cannot control its border.\n\n\"Their goal is to find some way to embarrass the U.S. government so we can't even control our own border,\" he said, responding to Fox & Friends co-host Steve Doocy's question about whether Congress should interfere. \"We have to be prepared to stand up to that and to do whatever is necessary. I mean, you're either going to have a country and have a border or you're not going to have a country.\"\n\nThe claim is the latest effort by Fox News to stoke fears about the thousands Central American migrants who are seeking asylum at the U.S. border. The migrant caravan -which Trump and other Republican lawmakers once called a national-security crisis -is still at the center of the conversation on the network, despite largely dropping off as a GOP talking point after the midterm elections.\n\nOver the weekend, images showed U.S. Border Patrol agents firing tear gas at migrants who tried to cross the San Ysidro Land Port of Entry between Tijuana and San Diego. But that didn't stop the hosts of Fox & Friends -Donald Trump's favorite unofficial advisers -and their guests from continuing their anti-immigration rhetoric.\n\nIn an attempt to justify the use of controversial crowd-control sprays, conservative commentator and NRATV host Dan Bongino praised Trump for being the only \"prominent Republican speaking out\" against the caravan.\n\n\"I don't mean to be hyperbolic about it, but clearly what happened yesterday were people trying to invade our border,\" he said on Fox & Friends Monday. \"What do you believe?\"\n\nLater in the show, Border Patrol Foundation President Rob Colburn argued that agents were using a \"natural\" pepper spray that is so harmless, it's edible.\n\n\"It's literally water, pepper, with a small amount of alcohol for evaporation purposes,\"  Colburn said. \"It's natural. You could actually put it on your nachos and eat it.\"\n\nTo the conservative network's dismay, migrants continued attempting to enter the U.S. on Monday, prompting Trump to threaten to permanently shut down the southern border.\n\n\"Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries,\" Trump tweeted on Monday . \"Do it by plane, do it by bus, do it anyway you want, but they are NOT coming into the U.S.A. We will close the Border permanently if need be. Congress, fund the WALL!\"\n\nThis threat, Fox News judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano admitted Monday, is actually illegal and not within Trump's powers as president.\n\n\"He cannot legally do it,\" Napolitano told Fox News anchor Sandra Smith, citing federal statutes. \"He doesn't have to tolerate lawlessness, and certainly the officials at the border can use reasonable resistance to lawlessness.\n\n\"But the law says if you have a bonafide asylum claim, meaning you're escaping a government that is pursuing you, or escaping a government that is failing to enforce basic law and order, you can enter the United States,\" he continued. \"The president doesn't want to hear this but this is the law.\"\n\nBut Gingrich didn't seem concerned by the illegality of Trump's threat, praising the president at the end of his segment while predicting the move would not be received well by Trump's favorite enemy: the media.\n\n\"I think President Trump is doing the right thing, and I think it's sad,\" Gingrich said. \"I bet you that the elite media spends a lot more time today on what's happening on the border than they're going to spend on the death of a young American who was killed by an illegal immigrant.\"\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

West is a professor of religion and African-American studies at Princeton University. West says, \"What I would like to see is radical reformism once more become fashionable among young people.\" [includes rush transcript]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The 2007 Left Forum came to a close Sunday in New York City. Each spring, the forum convenes the largest gathering here in the country of the international left. With close to a hundred panels, three major cultural events, the Left Forum brings together organizers and intellectuals from across the globe.\n\nOne of those who spoke was professor, culture critic, social justice advocate, Cornel West. He has been described as one of America's most vital and eloquent public intellectuals. A professor of religion and African-American studies at Princeton University, Professor West is a critic of culture, now analyst of postmodern art and philosophy, has written and co-authored many books on philosophy, race and sociology. His most recent book is Democracy Matters: Winning the Fight Against Imperialism . He addressed a panel at the Left Forum. Cornel West began by talking about the status of the political left in 2007.\n\nCORNEL WEST : What does it really mean to be a leftist in the early part of the 21st century? What are we really talking about? And I can just be very candid with you. It means to have a certain kind of temperament, to make certain kinds of political and ethical choices, and to exercise certain analytical focuses in targeting on the catastrophic and the monstrous, the scandalous, the traumatic, that are often hidden and concealed in the deodorized and manicured discourses of the mainstream. That's what it means to be a leftist. So let's just be clear about it.\n\nSo that if you are concerned about structural violence, if you're concerned about exploitation at the workplace, if you're concerned about institutionalized contempt against gay brothers and lesbian sisters, if you're concerned about organized hatred against peoples of color, if you're concerned about a subordination of women, that's not cheap PC chitchat; that is a calling that you're willing to fight against and try to understand the sources of that social misery at the structural and institutional level and at the existential and the personal level. That's what it means, in part, to be a leftist.\n\nThat's why we choose to be certain kinds of human beings. That's why it's a calling, not a career. It's a vocation, not a profession. That's why you see these veterans still here year after year after year, because they are convinced they don't want to live in a world and they don't want to be human in such a way that they don't exercise their intellectual and political and social and cultural resources in some way to leave the world just a little better than it was when they entered. That's, in part, what it means to be a leftist.\n\nNow, what does that mean for me? It means for me in the United States - and I go back now the 400 years to Jamestown. You all know this is the 400th anniversary of the first enduring English settlement in the new world. It was Roanoke before, but it didn't last. Jamestown last, right? And what do you have at Jamestown? The Virginia Club of London, an extension of the British Empire, makes its way over, the three boats whose names we need not go into at the moment. And what did they do? They interact with another empire, the Powhatan Empire, that's already in place, of indigenous peoples. You actually get the clash of empire. This is the age of empire.\n\nBut what are they here for? Looking for gold and silver and, secondarily, to civilize the natives. So already you get America as a corporation, before it's a country. Corporate greed is already sitting at the center in terms of what is pushing it. And corporate greed, as Marx understood it, capital as a social relation, an asymmetrical relation of power, with bosses and workers, with those at the top who will be able to live lives of luxury and those whose labor will be both indispensable, necessary, but also exploited in order to produce that wealth.\n\nThen there's religion, to \"civilize\" the indigenous people. Now, you can't talk about the U.S. experience - and I think in many ways this is true for the new world experience - without talking about the dominant role of religion as an ideology. And we also know one of the reasons why vast numbers of our fellow citizens today in the United States, one of the reasons why they're not leftists, is precisely because they have not been awakened from their sleepwalking. They have not been convinced that they ought to choose to live a life the way we have chosen, in part because we've been cast with the mark of the anti-religious or the naively secular, or what have you.\n\nAnd that's 98 percent of fellow citizens. So no matter what kind of political organization Brother Stanley is talking about, he's going to get Gramscian about it. He's got to dip into the popular culture of the everyday people, and 98 percent them are talking about God. That's 97.5 percent of fellow Americans believe in God. Seventy-five percent believe Jesus Christ is the son of God. Sixty-two percent believe they speak on intimate terms with God at least twice a day. That's who we're dealing with in terms of our fellow citizens. You can't talk about organization that's sustained over time, unless you're talking in Gramscian terms of how do you tease out leftist sentiment, vision, analysis, in light of the legacy of these dominant ideologies - Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, and so forth and so on.\n\nBut then, what else happens? 1619, you've got white slaves and you've got black slaves. You have the first representative assembly that takes place as modeled on the corporation, but it is attempt at democratic elections, the first representative assembly. They gathered July 30, 1619. They cancelled August 4, because it got too hot. And 13 days later, here comes the boat with the first Africans. And at that time, slavery was not racialized. You had white slaves and you had black slaves.\n\nBut the white slaves, you look on the register, 1621, they had names like James Stewart and Charles McGregor. But you look on the right side and you see Negro, Negro, Negro, Negro. So even before slavery became a perpetual and inheritable structure of domination that would exploit the labor of Africans and devalue their sense of who they were and view their bodies as an abomination, you already had the black problematic of namelessness. White supremacy was already setting in as another dominant ideology to ensure that these working people do not come together.\n\nAnd corporate greed would run amok in the midst of that kind of deep and profound division, which is not just a political division. It's a creation of different worlds, so that the de facto white supremacist segregation that would be part and parcel of the formation of the American Empire would constitute very different worlds and constitute a major challenge to what it means to be a leftist in America from 1776 up until 1963, given the overthrow of American apartheid, which took place in the '60s. And then, we now wrestle with the legacy, with the triumph of the black freedom movement and all of the white and black - I mean, the white and brown and yellow and Asian comrades who were part and parcel of that black freedom movement that broke the back of American apartheid in the '60s.\n\nWhat am I saying? I'm saying, in part, that at least for me to be a leftist these days, in the way in which - and I take very seriously Antonio Gramsci's concern about the historical specificity of the emergeous sustenance and development and subsequent define of the American Empire. And when you actually look closely at that empire, it seems to me what we have to come to terms with is the fundamental role of corporate greed, religious ideologies, white supremacy, the fundamental role of the popular culture, youth, and acknowledge that anytime you're talking about white supremacy, you're always already in some ways talking about the treatment of black women. And if you're concerned about the treatment of black women, you ought to be concerned about the treatment of women across the board. So the vicious ideologies, the patriarchy, come in. And the same thing would be true for the James Baldwins and the Audre Lordes, the gay brothers and the lesbian sisters.\n\nNow, where does that leave us? Well, for me - and you all know about the Covenant movement of Tavis Smiley, the book that was launched last year, went number one in The New York Times . We sold 400,000 copies within nine months, not reviewed by The New York Times , not touched by the Today Show . Even Oprah wouldn't breathe on it. And she can breathe on books and sell half a million these days, you know that? We just ask Sidney Poitier and Brother Elie Wiesel for that. But this book went underground.\n\nWhy? Because Tavis Smiley knows that in an American culture that is so thoroughly commodified, driven by corporate greed, thoroughly commercialized, driven by corporate greed, thoroughly marketized, driven by corporate greed, you have to be able to communicate in such a way that you might be able then to shake people from their sleepwalking, which he's done every year now on C- SPAN , and uses his position in order to raise issues of right to healthcare, community-based policing so you can deal with some of this police brutality, especially in black and brown communities of proletarian and lumpenproletarian character, and so forth.\n\nYou look in The New York Times last Sunday: volume two was number seven, 150,000 copies sold in three weeks. Three weeks. We just got off a 21-city tour. We did a 22-city tour last year. The book, not reviewed at all. Mainstream television won't touch it.\n\nWhat is going on? Is the Ice Age beginning to melt? Is it the case that the 35 years that Brother Stanley talked about, the Ice Age, the historical period where it's fashionable to be indifferent to other people's suffering - indifference is the very trait that makes the very angels weep, to be callus toward catastrophe. And it's true, New Orleans was catastrophic before Katrina hit. Flint, New Orleans without Katrina. We can look at places in Brooklyn, Harlem, South Side of Chicago, barrios in East Los Angeles, white brothers and sisters in Kentucky, Appalachia, wrestling with catastrophic situations. Catastrophic situations.\n\nMeaning what? Meaning that maybe we're at a moment now where there's going to be multiple strategies going on. It's clear that the Democratic Party remains clueless, visionless and spineless for the most part. Does that mean you give up on them? No, doesn't mean you give up on them, but you have to be honest with them. But it does allow one to, in some way - and this is what I think Brother Rick Wolff was talking about in terms of the desegregation of the right-wing consensus, the unbelievable ways in which now right-wing fellow citizens are at each other's throats. The evangelical right wing can't stand the free marketeers, can't stand the balanced-budgeters. That's fine. Let them fight. Let them fight. Let them go at each other. They're weakened in that way.\n\nBut what kind of alternative do have we? I don't have an answer to that. I don't think that the left has enough resources, has enough people to constitute a strong political organization, Stanley. We can argue over that. We just had drinks for two hours, so we've already had some discussion. I think that by raising the issue, it forces us to come to terms with who we really are. That's what I like. That's Socratic. That's provocative.\n\nNow, what we do with it, I don't know. I really don't. And the reason why I say that is because historically for me, you know, most of the kind of leftist movements tended to actually respond to reformist activity in which the struggle against white supremacy was a major catalyst. And so, when I think of all the work that I'm doing right now, especially in black America, but always, of course, tied to an instant coalition, leftist identity is not going to be the major means by which you get at people to wake up and come to terms with their social misery, be willing to stand up courageously, articulate vision, and most importantly, have a slice of people who are willing to live and die for a cause, you see, because they have other stories and other narratives that they use to do that.\n\nSo I would even argue, in some way, that Martin King and Fannie Lou Hamer were much more important than the Black Panther Party. They were actually building on what Martin and the others built, as much as I love Huey and Bobby Seale. They took it further. But the door was opened by these reformist activities. And what I would love to see is the radical reformism once more become fashionable among young people, and then allow the leftists to come in and do our thing. That's what I'm looking for. I'd better stop now. Thank you for having me.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Princeton University Professor Cornel West speaking at the Left Forum here in New York City.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh, as we continue with Part 2 of our conversation about, well, \"Left Internationalism in the Heart of Empire.\" That's the title of an essay in Dissent magazine by Aziz Rana, law professor at Cornell University and author of the book The Two Faces of American Freedom . We're also joined by Darryl Li, a professor at University of Chicago, author of the book The Universal Enemy: Jihad, Empire, and the Challenge of Solidarity . Darryl Li is one of a number of scholars who wrote a response to Professor Rana's essay in a special issue of Dissent magazine on foreign policy.\n\nSo, Darryl, we were last talking to you, in Part 1 of our conversation, the problem of building networks of global solidarity on the left around foreign policy. More obviously, at home, progressives are more united on issues of how to deal with immigration, climate, how to take on issues, say, for example, of reproductive rights and abortion. What does that look like internationally, and specifically focused on foreign policy?\n\nDARRYL LI: Well, actually, I was going to expand on a slightly different point that Aziz was making, which is connecting the international and the domestic. And I think when it comes to immigrant rights, this is a very important and often missed opportunity. We know from the history of the Cold War that there's always been the possibility of people coming over from other parts of the world where their experiences with other regimes and other places leads them to embrace kind of the U.S. national security establishment, right? So, we think of, of course, the example of the Cuban and Iranian, Vietnamese émigré populations.\n\nSo I think one important place for the left to be looking, going forward, is organizing with immigrant populations, including from places such as Afghanistan, with all the people who were resettled after the U.S. evacuation, but to do so in a way that really challenges the kind of U.S. exceptionalism and aspiration to whiteness that often dominates immigrant rights discourses, right? We want to think about all of the different diasporas that are here in the United States as potential vectors to connect with communities all around the world, but to do so in a way that much more critically kind of engages with their place inside the United States, their relationship to settler colonialism, to anti-Blackness, and, as well, in more critically interrogating and rejecting the imperialist aspirations of the United States around the world.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Darryl, could you respond also to Amy's question about - which is the focus of some of your work - the difficulties of building networks of global solidarity on issues related to foreign policy, given the fact, as you were saying in Part 1 of our interview, that the position the left takes is determined, in part or substantially, by where the person is in the world? In other words, someone in Karachi will not have the same position - a left person in Karachi will not have the same position as someone in New York or in Lima or in Tokyo.\n\nDARRYL LI: I think too often folks on the left, I think, tend to assume that there is one correct left position that applies to leftists all around the world. And as you point out in your question, that's not really a tenable proposition. And I think recognizing that there are different interests at stake is the first step to figuring out where you can find common ground and to work from there. Too often, as Aziz was alluding to earlier, we just tend to ignore that those people exist, or sometimes even dismiss or demonize them. So that's clearly an ongoing problem.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Aziz, I want to go back to a point that you made in the first part of our interview, where you, of course, laid out what the failures of U.S. foreign policy have been since - minimally, since 1945. And although you say that in some instances - and Ukraine is the most recent example - military support can't be entirely ruled out, you also say, correctly, that it's a problem that that military support, in the case of U.S. military support for Ukraine, is now not just defensive support - in other words, defending Ukraine against Russian aggression - but has actually become about far more, as you said in Part 1 , about weakening Russia, an adversary of the U.S., strengthening the U.S. position in Europe and so on. Given the history that you yourself outline of U.S. interventions around the world and their egregious effects, isn't it inevitable that U.S. policies and objectives in the event of any kind of intervention would include its own interests, that, in fact, often, if not uniformly, are problematic for the region?\n\nAZIZ RANA : So, you know, I don't - I don't really disagree. If you just look at the long history of American interventionism, from various forms of military support through to boots on the ground, airstrikes, it's a history, really, of coercive violence and various kinds of rights violations that have been pretty destructive. And you can tell that story dating back to '45. You can tell that story as a story of the long history, really, of American settler colonialism, linking the experience on the frontier domestically to what ends up being American global power overseas.\n\nSo, I do think that there's a set of national security dynamics that almost always combine - and we're seeing this again - geostrategic interests that are built around American primacy and the projection of American power with whatever that's taking place locally, in ways that end up undermining oftentimes meaningful local aspirations. I think that is the background story. And I think it means that as a basic position, the position should be one, domestically, of saying to the - saying in the context of various new conflicts and crises that the underlying approach vis-à-vis what the state is doing is a principle of \"do no harm.\" To what extent is the state operating in a way that's actually facilitating, expanding various forms of humanitarian crisis, conflict and violence, and then contesting those actions?\n\nNow, even though that's the background, bedrock assumption, that doesn't mean that there are no circumstances under which one might still say, actually, it's important for, you know, foreign states to provide various kinds of military assistance. I would say, for instance, as an exception, that the story in the early 1990s about the war in Bosnia, where you had, essentially, a Serbian invasion, and then you had a policy that was more or less an arms embargo. So, not providing arms assistance to Bosnians on the ground helped set the stage for ethnic cleansing and had various kinds of deleterious consequences. And then the failure to provide military assistance, that would have been defensive military assistance, then became a justification later on for an illegal bombing campaign in Kosovo that initiated two decades-plus, really, of sustained U.S. rule defection.\n\nAnd the reason why it's important to be able to note that you can't have a totalizing policy of nonintervention is because it's important, I think, in articulating a clear alternative, not just to be framed by what the state does, but to actually articulate, well, how is it, if you in fact had left forces in charge of a powerful state, would they respond. And I think the appropriate response in a setting like Ukraine or in a circumstance like what I described with Bosnia would be defensive military assistance combined with an effort to pursue, in a sustained and rigorous way - excuse me - peaceful resolutions that deal with the humanitarian effects both within the local setting and also globally.\n\nOne of the reasons why it's important to lay that out is because it's useful as a way of then juxtaposing against what in fact the U.S. state does, and that the U.S. state, precisely by combining what might be legitimate calls for anti-imperialism and local self-determination with its grander geostrategic interest in global primacy, ends up pursuing policies that I think push in escalatory and militarized directions that can be quite harmful. But it's important to be able to still carve out space that's not just totalizingly noninterventionist and that also is able to establish, well, what would be the kind of principled alternative that's between these poles of nonintervention and then simply accepting what the U.S. does, especially in a world that's moving further and further towards multipolarity.\n\nAnd just as a last thing on Darryl's point about solidarity, which I absolutely underscore, that I think it is important to recognize that what the - a left position in the U.S. might be very different than a left position in Ukraine or, let's say, in Syria, where it might make a lot of sense for folks on the ground in places like Ukraine and Syria to even want to have American or Western military intervention or stronger forms of support as a response to what their own conditions and circumstances are. That may be one of the live positions. But in the U.S., I think the orientation has to be: Well, what is it that our state does, and what responsibilities do we have vis-à-vis how our state operates? And that's why the principle of \"do no harm\" has to take center stage and might countenance having a far more restricted and limited set of involvements by the U.S. than what, you know, allies elsewhere might want. But one of the ways to navigate those differences and cleavages is to have frameworks put in place where the first time you're interacting with somebody that is a leftist in Syria or a leftist in the Ukraine is not in the context of a crisis but through background sets of arrangements in which there's a kind of commonality and recognition of shared commitment and interest.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Darryl Li, if you could respond to what Aziz Rana is saying, and also, before we end, bring China into this picture? I mean, there was just this NATO meeting in Madrid, protests outside the meeting. And they brought in for the first time Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, clearly as a show of force against China.\n\nDARRYL LI: Yeah, I think I agree with everything that Aziz just said, namely, that solidarity sometimes requires disagreement and sometimes requires saying no. But doing so as part of an ongoing conversation, as Aziz was alluding to, is very different than doing it kind of as an act of dismissal. And similarly, it's very important not to be antiwar only when the jets are being scrambled, as it were. The case of ex-Yugoslavia, as Aziz is pointing out, is an excellent example of this. The U.S. is always already intervening, right? And oftentimes in situations where they don't have a clear proxy on the ground, sometimes the strategy is to essentially bleed both sides out. They did this during the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s. This was, to a certain extent, the policy in ex-Yugoslavia in the '90s of preventing Bosnian Muslims or the Bosnian state from arming itself, while then setting itself up, setting NATO up as kind of the cavalry to come in at the end of the day. And, of course, it was the policy in Syria, as well. So, this is - it's extremely important. And again, this is the sort of thing that if you had an ongoing conversation with left movements on the ground, you would have a better sense of and be able to sort of - to sort of wrap your head around.\n\nAs far as China is concerned, you know, it's not - I'm not an expert on it, but it just stands to common sense that all of the dilemmas that we've been talking about in terms of what does it mean to be a person on the left in the West in an era of multipolarity, all those dilemmas seem to be magnified and intensified by, you know, an order of magnitude, if we think about the continuing rise of the power of the Chinese state and its relationship with the United States. I think all sorts of populations on both sides of the Pacific are at risk of being victimized by this dynamic, albeit in very different ways, everything from, of course, you know, what's happening in Xinjiang and in Hong Kong, Taiwan, with their own different crises, as well as Asian American populations and the violence against them, you know, in the wake of COVID . So, this is all to say that the dilemmas that we've been talking about, looking backwards over the past 30 years, are in some ways very small dress rehearsals for the dilemmas and the crises that will probably be coming down the pike.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And finally, Darryl, do you see any signs of an emerging global solidarity movement on issues of foreign policy?\n\nDARRYL LI: Um, I'm not sure if I do. But I think, as Aziz alluded to earlier, it's not - I think, usually, when two professors get together to talk about something, it's because it's already happened out there in the world, right? So we're not exactly the best people to go to on this.\n\nIn my own research, I've attempted to address this question of \"What does it mean to organize, you know, on some sort of basis of transnational solidarity in the face of U.S. empire? And what does it mean to do so with guns, with weapons?\" And for that reason, my research led me to look at transnational jihad movements. That's not normally how they're approached. Normally, they're seen as kind of a security problem or a problem with, you know, what's wrong with Islam. But in my own academic research, I've been kind of trying to think about what kinds of lessons can a global left learn from these previous mobilizations. You know, they're obviously coming at it from a very different perspective, and I'm not at all suggesting that they are to be emulated. But I think they have, at the very least, attempted to take on these challenges. And that's something, unfortunately, that a lot of folks who identify with the left have tended to shy away from.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you both for being with us, Darryl Li, anthropologist, professor at the University of Chicago, author of the book The Universal Enemy: Jihad, Empire, and the Challenge of Solidarity , and Aziz Rana, a professor at Cornell University. His major Dissent article in their new issue is headlined \"Left Internationalism in the Heart of Empire.\" We'll link to the essay and all of the response , including Professor Darryl Li's.\n\nTo see Part 1 of our discussion, go to democracynow.org.

In the latest developments, opposition candidate Edmundo González published a count of thousands of vote tally sheets alleging that he received more votes than sitting President Nicolás Maduro, who is claiming to have secured a third term fairly. Protesters from both sides have taken to the streets; more than a dozen have been killed by Venezuelan armed forces. Maduro has called for a \"new revolution\" if the U.S. and other foreign actors continue to back his opposition and dispute the integrity of the election. We hear opinions from both camps on the show today. \"There's no doubt that Maduro lost these elections,\" says Venezuelan sociologist Edgardo Lander, who contends that sufficient evidence of Maduro's win \"that's expected and established by the law is completely absent,\" while legal scholar Nina Farnia, who served as electoral observer in this year's election, says she witnessed a \"free and fair election process\" and supports the Electoral Council's decision.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe turn now to Venezuela, where tension is rising over the contested results of the presidential election that took place just over a week ago. The incumbent president, Nicolás Maduro, who was declared the winner by Venezuela's National Electoral Council, has vowed to \"pulverize\" the U.S.-backed opposition, which has released thousands of vote tally sheets to back its claims that opposition candidate Edmundo González received more than twice as many votes as Maduro. Countries including the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay, Costa Rica and Ecuador have recognized González as Venezuela's president-elect. But others have questioned the authenticity of the opposition's tally sheets, which González and fellow opposition leader María Corina Machado said they secured from polling centers nationwide.\n\nDueling protests continued in Caracas and other cities this weekend both in support of Maduro and against him. Rights groups have denounced the crackdown on opposition protests, with Human Rights Watch estimating at least 20 people have been killed by Venezuelan Armed Forces. Maduro spoke from Caracas Saturday.\n\nPRESIDENT NICOLÁS MADURO : [translated] We have 2,000 prisoners captured. From there, they go to Tocorón and Tocuyito prisons, maximum punishment, justice. This time, there will be no forgiveness. This time, there will be Tocorón prison.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : On Friday, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador criticized the Biden administration for recognizing Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo González as president-elect.\n\nPRESIDENT ANDRÉS MANUEL LÓPEZ OBRADOR : [translated] We make a respectful appeal to all governments to ensure that there is no interventionism. No government is authorized. It is not legal. It is not legitimate to issue a ruling giving victory or loss to a candidate from another country. What is that? There is no world government.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This all comes as the U.N. Refugee Agency estimates more than 7.7 million people have been forced to leave Venezuela since 2014, as sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union have devastated Venezuela's economy.\n\nFor more, we're joined by two guests. In Caracas, Edgardo Lander is with us. He is a sociologist, where he is part of the Citizen's Platform in Defense of the Constitution, part of a Latin American network of activists and academics called Ecosocial and Intercultural Pact of the South. And in Albany, New York, we're joined by Nina Farnia, a legal historian at Albany Law School. She's the co-founder of the International People's Tribunal on U.S. Imperialism and Sanctions. She just returned from Caracas, where she volunteered with the National Lawyers Guild as an election observer.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! Let's begin in Caracas. Edgardo Lander, if you can explain what you think took place?\n\nEDGARDO LANDER : Good morning, Amy. Thanks for the invitation and the opportunity to talk to you and your audience.\n\nThere is no doubt that Maduro was overwhelmingly defeated by this elections. The electoral system in Venezuela, it's - the technical part of the system is probably one of the best in the world. There's hardly any possibility of interference with the results at the technical level. But there are many mechanisms incorporated into the system, including paper ballots, that are printed, and acts that are registered and signed by the witnesses at each voting booth that can be compared with the results presented by the totals of the Electoral Council.\n\nAll the steps that secure the system that are checks established in the system were completely thrown out by the Electoral Council. They published a made-up data, so-called final results. They declared Maduro president before they had even finished counting. There were more than - almost 3 million votes that hadn't been counted by the time they declared.\n\nAnd it is a fact that the witnesses at the voting booths have copies of what actually happened at each voting booth. And it's clear that these papers show that there was an overwhelming result. I directly know of several centers in - that had been radically Chavistas up to some short time ago where the results were against the government. This is really representative also of a tendency where even the most Chavista centers in the country voted against Maduro. So there's no doubt that Maduro lost this elections.\n\nMaduro has now decided to ask the Supreme Court to check the whole process again in order to figure out what's going on.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, let's go to Nina Farnia.\n\nEDGARDO LANDER : It's very clear that this is - this caused -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Edgardo, we're going to get comment from Nina Farnia, legal historian at Albany Law School. You're just back from Venezuela. You were an observer with the National Lawyers Guild. If you can talk about what you saw, and respond to Edgardo Lander?\n\nNINA FARNIA : Well, thank you for having me on, Amy.\n\nWhat we witnessed, by and large, was a free and fair election process, which explains why former President Jimmy Carter once called this system the best electoral system in the world. We were part of a large international delegation of election monitors that included members of the African Union and the Latin American election experts, and we were quarantined with the rest of our delegation in a hotel that was separate from all the political activities. We attended days of trainings about the Venezuelan electoral system, about the laws that protect it, and then we were taken - prior to the elections, we were taken to polling stations around the country, where we saw the touchscreen voting machines. We saw the ballot boxes for the paper ballots. We met the directors of each voting center.\n\nOn the day of the election, our NLG delegation had the privilege of interviewing voters as they were going in and out of the voting room, and we also interviewed members of each of the parties that were there to monitor the elections, the polling stations. We also interviewed opposition voters. We didn't hear any concerns from any voters or observers. Every single person that we spoke with said that this is a free and fair process. They had faith in the system. And, in fact, what we saw was a ton of energy around each of the stations that we visited. People were proud to vote. They take that - they view voting as a pillar of the Venezuelan democracy and of the Bolivarian Revolution.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And your sense of what had happened before? The polls showed that González had won or was going to win by a landslide. Ultimately, what the Electoral Council announced was that - and, of course, we all know that polls can be very wrong - was that Maduro had won by 51%, Nina.\n\nNINA FARNIA : Yes. So, exit polling is illegal in Venezuela, because it can - it has the effect of altering votes. And also, a lot of the polling results that were used in the U.S. media, the polling predictions that were used in the U.S. media were discredited by Venezuelanalysis, a trusted news source in Venezuela, that has also been critical of the Maduro government.\n\nWe actually are very concerned by the claim that González has won. González was a diplomat in - a Venezuelan diplomat in El Salvador during the Salvadoran death squads. He was number two stationed there. He has blood on his hands. He has Salvadoran blood on his hands. And so, the idea that the Venezuelans would support a government, a president who executed U.S. foreign policy in El Salvador decades ago is shocking to us. It's up, ultimately, to the Supreme Court to decide.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Edgardo Lander, you have said it's clear that Maduro lost. You are a leading left voice in Venezuela and, globally, one of the early leaders of the World Social Forum. Even in the United States, when they were demanding that the ballots be shown the following morning, they are not available, for example, in the United States, what happens, right after an election. In what way were these opposition shown ballots verified by anyone but the opposition? And what do you say, Edgardo Lander, to those fellow leftists who say this is a result of a longtime U.S. campaign to unseat Maduro, to destabilize his government with crushing sanctions?\n\nEDGARDO LANDER : In the first place, the demand to have public access to the ballots is not some weird demand that somebody made up. It's part of the controls that are established in Venezuelan laws. According to Venezuelan laws, the Electoral Council has to publicly present the ballots at each voting center. And it has absolutely denied to do so. So it's absolutely clear that they had presented a total result with no backing whatsoever, so the backing that's expected and established by the law is completely absent.\n\nThe ballots that are in the hands of the González people are not the only ballots that are available, because different candidates and their witnesses get copies of the ballots at the voting centers. And all the ballots that are in the hands of this several other candidates show the same tendencies. They show the tendencies that there was an overwhelming majority of people voting against Maduro.\n\nI think that this is a test for the left internationally. If the left in many places of the world, in Latin America, in the United States, Europe, some sectors of the left, continue to call the Venezuelan government as a revolutionary leftist government, if this repressive, authoritarian, corrupt, extractivist government that is destroying the environment, and it's in constant violation of human rights, is defined as left, if this is what's presented as the offer for the future of humanity, then it's clear that this left is contributing to increasing the appeal of the right wing and the far right wing. This has ceased to be a leftist government a long time ago.\n\nThe conflict in Venezuela has not been in this election a conflict between left and right. It's a conflict between a repressive government and a whole spread of positions in Venezuelan society that go from far right to left, that includes social democrats, that includes progressives, that includes liberals. It includes a whole spread of people who want to recover democracy, who want to recover the Constitution in Venezuela, which is completely violated by this increasingly authoritarian government. If this result is imposed on the Venezuelan society, this could be the nail on the coffin that will be the end result of these authoritarian tendencies that have been going on for quite some time and establish a truly authoritarian government.\n\nSo it's very important for the left in Venezuela to get as much solidarity from the left internationally in the recognition that this is not a U.S. conspiracy, that it's not fascism. We reject U.S. intervention. The United States has no right to decide who won the elections. This is an issue for Venezuelans to decide. And the United States has been intervening in Venezuela for a long time. Sanctions have had a dramatic impact on Venezuelan society. The humanitarian crisis and almost 8 million people that have left the country because they see no future are basically the result of U.S. intervention and U.S. sanctions. So, it's not in any way a support for U.S. position. We, from the left, reject U.S. intervention and insist on the fact that it's not for the United States to decide who won the election.\n\nBut in Venezuela, according to the ballots that are in the hands of the citizens, it's quite clear that there is a violation of the electoral laws. If the basic mechanism established in the Electoral Council for guaranteeing that the results are free - that the elections are free is the comparison between the printed ballots and the signed documents at each voting booth, with the totals presented by the Electoral Council, this is the main of several mechanisms to guarantee that the elections really reflect - the results reflect the will of the people. If the government refuses to show their results and just makes up some random numbers, there's no way then the Venezuelan society can trust what the results are. It's obvious that the government denies the possibility of doing what the law requires it to do, which is to present each voting booth result.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Nina Farnia, we gave -\n\nEDGARDO LANDER : It refuses to do so. It's very -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We gave Edgardo Lander the first word. We give you the last.\n\nNINA FARNIA : First of all, I want to correct Professor Lander. The Venezuelan government, according to the laws that we learned about while we were there, has 30 days to release the tallies from the day of the election. We're not even 10 days yet. Second of all, it's not up to the international left to decide who the president of Venezuela is. It's up to the Venezuelan people. And it's difficult for me to trust somebody who is known to have met with the widely discredited figure Juan Guaidó, about what the Venezuelan left should or shouldn't do, or whether or not the Maduro government is a leftist government.\n\nThe Venezuelan people, it looks like, based on our perceptions of the process, of the election process, chose President Maduro. But to the extent that there's disagreement about what actually happened, the Supreme Court should be allowed to decide, not Secretary of State Blinken, who came out last week saying Venezuela needs to transition away from socialism, or anybody else. It's up to the Venezuelan people.\n\nVenezuela has been subject to hybrid warfare, which includes election tampering, severe sanctions, targeted assassinations. Just this morning, a democratic official was assassinated. The Venezuelan people have the right to challenge U.S. interference and U.S. imperialism, and they get to decide who their president is, not the international left, not Secretary of State Blinken, no one else.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you both so much for being with us, and, of course, we're going to continue to follow this issue in Venezuela. Nina Farnia is a legal historian at Albany Law School. She volunteered with the National Lawyers Guild as an election observer in Venezuela. And we want to thank Edgardo Lander. Edgardo Lander is a sociologist in Caracas, Venezuela.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Rana argues for the creation of a \"transnational infrastructure of left forces across the world\" and says movements of the left need \"clear alternatives to the hardest questions\" of foreign policy crises, such as the Russian war in Ukraine. We also speak with Darryl Li, professor at the University of Chicago, who is one of many scholars who published a response to Rana's piece in the new issue of Dissent that highlights the importance of a nuanced and solution-oriented critical analysis of U.S. foreign policy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nWe end today's show looking at \"Left Internationalism in the Heart of Empire.\" That's the title of an essay in Dissent magazine by Aziz Rana, law professor at Cornell University, author of the book The Two Faces of American Freedom .\n\nRana writes, quote, \"At present, the possible futures that lay before us appear strikingly dystopian: either we languish in an old, broken Pax Americana or we slide into a new multipolar order dictated by competing capitalist authoritarianisms. Without a strong and coherent left alternative, finding a global pathway better than these options will only be that much harder,\" he says.\n\nDissent has also published responses to Professor Rana's essay by a number of scholars, including the anthropologist Darryl Li, professor at University of Chicago, author of The Universal Enemy: Jihad, Empire, and the Challenge of Solidarity . Darryl Li and Aziz Rana join us now.\n\nLet's begin with professor Aziz Rana. Why don't you lay out your argument in this major piece that you have written for Dissent that has gotten so much response?\n\nAZIZ RANA : Well, first, thank so much for having me on the show. It's great to be here.\n\nSo, the argument that I make is that if you just think of the long history of the national security establishment's policies throughout the entire post-Cold War period, it's one of repeated failure. So, these are terrible elective wars of choice in the Middle East, along with destructive neoliberal policies that have really promoted austerity and mass economic immiseration across large segments of the world, including coming back home in the U.S. And yet every time there's a new international crisis, it's as if that past is just wiped clean, and it's instead left critics of the national security establishment to find themselves on the defensive. And so I try to kind of work through why that's the case.\n\nAnd the argument that I make is it has to do with certain tendencies in the way in which left voices articulate opposition to the national security framework. And it also has to do with the fact that the left really needs clear alternatives to the hardest questions, and that all of that requires thinking about foreign policy in a way that's different than we traditionally do. We tend to think of the domestic realm as a site for mobilization, for movement building and for power building, but we think of foreign policy as about expertise. And that actually has to be broken.\n\nThe strongest periods of sustained left international foreign policy were times in which you had really powerful transnational movements, tied to labor and then tied to anti-colonial movements, that link together unions at home and abroad, as well as antiracist forces in the U.S. and anti-colonial forces overseas, and that we need something similar. We need to have strong transnational institutions built around mobilization that create and stitch together a common vision of what the future will hold. And that means pressing for policies that you might not oftentimes think of as about power building. Take, for instance, opposition or containment of international corporate property rights, strengthening global labor rights. These are good for workers, but they're also a way of reviving perhaps the classic 20th century institution of the transnational left, which was global labor, that there needs to be infrastructures and homes to house conversations across borders about how to build an alternative world.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : So, Darryl Li, could we get your response? You are one of the respondents to Aziz in this special issue of Dissent on foreign policy, which is now out. One of the points that you make in your response is talking about the American left response to the crisis that ensued following the popular uprising in Syria in 2011. You write, quote, \"while online leftists loudly tore each other to shreds, Washington and Damascus (backed by Moscow) quietly arrived at a modus vivendi whereby each side could bomb its enemies while they worked together to ensure their jets did not collide.\" How do you interpret that response in 2011, and for many years after that, to what's happening now with respect to the left response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine?\n\nDARRYL LI: Good morning. Thanks for having me on.\n\nI think the point that I was trying to make there sort of is the unfortunate mirror of the dilemma that Aziz lays out in his article, which is that in a series of crises since the end of the Cold War, where humanitarian intervention - or, better yet, humanitarian invasion - has been on the cards, the people who identify with the left in the West, in the United States, are constantly, again and again, kind of being pushed into a corner or boxed in. And I think it's important to recognize that that's a structural dilemma, right? Like, in any situation where there is talk about humanitarian invasion, we are talking about a situation of some kind of great power competition, right? Because if it was a situation where the West clearly had hegemony, we wouldn't be talking about humanitarian invasion in the first place. And if it's a situation where a non-Western great power is calling the shots, then the West doesn't have a low-cost military option to begin with. So, in places like ex-Yugoslavia in the '90s, and then Libya and Syria later on, these are situations where, yes, the United States is engaged in acts of imperialism and violence, but it's also not the only significant actor on the ground. And that is the persistent structural dilemma that the left has really struggled with and just not had a clear answer to over the past few decades.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : The moment, in the case of Ukraine, at least initially, there was one clear aggressor, though now the equation has completely changed with the influx of massive amounts of military aid and defensive military equipment. So, can you speak specifically about that and how that complicates, or should complicate or may complicate, the U.S. left's response?\n\nDARRYL LI: Yeah, absolutely. I think it's just a more intense version of the dilemma. Clearly, you have a war of aggression by Russia. But, of course, U.S. and NATO imperialism is another very important factor in the overall discussion.\n\nAnd what's been the thing that has really struck me about this conversation with folks on the left in the West is that it has largely kind of rested on a denunciation of hypocrisy and double standards by the West - right? - talking about why the U.S. is paying attention to Ukraine and not other places, or decrying the sort of racist treatment and abuse of refugees of African origin in the area. And I think calling out hypocrisy and double standards is absolutely necessary and just and correct, but it needs to be the start of the conversation, and too often it's where the analysis sort of ends.\n\nAnd I think that is actually a symptom of the kind of disempowerment that Aziz is talking about, where the left in the West has a clearer sense of what it stands against and not as clear a sense of what it stands for in these types of situations.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor Aziz Rana, if you could respond to Professor Li and also talk about what a genuine left global international would look like? You talk about the strengthening of labor rights around the world and formulating a critique of, undoing neoliberalism central to forming such a global movement.\n\nAZIZ RANA : Yeah. So, you know, first, I agree pretty - I agree pretty entirely with what Darryl was just saying, which is that, you know, Ukraine in a way is a microcosm of this problem, which is that there are kind of two tendencies that you see in the U.S. So, you have one tendency, which, in the face of a kind of clear agenda from the U.S. national security state, that puts together a set of policies that are really a conveyor belt of policies that snap into place almost regardless of what the crisis is - and we're seeing this again in Ukraine - that combine aggressive sanctions, militarized confrontation. One position is to just accede to what the state is doing. And so you have, for instance, the elected wing of the social democratic elements of the Democratic Party more or less just accepting whatever it is that the Biden administration is pursuing, up to and including defense spending in the context of Ukraine that exceeds or is equal to the entire State Department's budget, so accepting an old separation between domestic and foreign, where foreign is not what you organize around, except if there are actual American boots on the ground. And so, that's one position that I think is a kind of silence that's a huge problem.\n\nBut then the other position is to avoid recognizing the incipient forms of, really, capitalist authoritarianism that we're seeing in the breakdown of American unipolarity and the rise of a multipolar order, and so refusing to call out the kinds of imperialism and authoritarianism that doesn't necessarily come out of the U.S. And so, it's really important in this moment to have a politics that, as a colleague, Bassam Haddad, has noted, articulates a principle of anti-imperialism and anti-authoritarianism together.\n\nNow, what I would say in the context of Ukraine is that this is an act of imperial aggression that is a violation of any anti-colonial principle of self-determination, and so it requires strong support for defensive military assistance of a country that's facing an imperial invader. But the issue with the American approach is that that's been combined with a geostrategic effort to really weaken a regional adversary, and so it's been wrapped up in this aggressive sanctions and militarized confrontation policy that has really deleterious effects for the future of Europe, in my view, as well as for humanitarian conditions both in Ukraine but then also around the world.\n\nAnd so, rather than accepting an either/or framework, where you can either sign up to everything that the U.S. does or just support nonintervention, I think it requires a disaggregated approach that emphasizes the importance, yes, of genuinely defensive military assistance, but that's tied to a focus on deescalation, diplomatic negotiation, that puts front and center local concerns but also humanitarian suffering, and that is tied to a genuinely solidaristic global approach that looks at the humanitarian effects worldwide. We just heard about what was happening in Sri Lanka. And it's, I think, a significant flaw of the American conversation that the fact that, as the U.N. secretary-general says, 1.7 billion people around the world, as a function of both the war and the sanctions approach, find themselves facing precarity in the context of global food, energy and financial crises, that hasn't been part of the response. There's clearly money. If there's money for weapons to flood Europe, there's certainly money to address some of these harms that are taking place far away from Ukraine and Russia. And that should be part of the conversation that we have. But that requires resisting the either/or framework that's being presented.\n\nAnd as far as, like, a global agenda, you know, there are lots of elements of what I think would be an important left foreign policy - confronting climate change, dealing with issues of economic redistribution, creating something like a genuinely different approach and a redistributive approach to the global commons. But I think the first and most important thing is creating the transnational infrastructure for left forces across the world to be able to speak to each other.\n\nWhenever there's a new crisis - and this is the last point that I'll make. Whenever there's a new crisis, it's very easy for, you know, Biden to talk to Boris Johnson or to Zelensky, because there are these networks across nation-state organizations and national security frameworks. But the left has basically been contained over the last 50 years, in the context of conservative retrenchment, within its borders. And the folks that are talking about foreign policy, frankly, in the U.S. are people like me, which are kind of footloose academics that have no real connection to movements or to global institutions. And that actually has to be reversed, that you have to be able to build frameworks in which you have left forces across the world in conversation to build up alternative approaches.\n\nAnd that, to me, puts a premium on the kinds of reforms, that we might think of as nonreformist reforms, that strengthen the power of transnational left institutions. So, this has to do with the position of the global labor movement, but it also has to do with the position of immigrants and migrant rights, so a strong commitment to decriminalizing the border, which is a way of strengthening working-class actors both within the U.S. and across the border, and it also has to do with significant changes to the nature of our security budget, cutbacks in the security budget, which then mobilize domestic forces around economic needs and show how economic needs, like pressing for a public commitment to health, education, housing, etc., are directly tied to the actions of the national security state and have implications for how American corporations and military elites operate abroad.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Very quickly, Darryl - we just have 30 seconds, but we're going to continue this conversation after the broadcast - you speak about the difficulty of what Aziz is saying, because, of course, the left position is determined in part by where you are in the world.\n\nDARRYL LI: Yeah, absolutely. And I think solidarity is extremely important. I think it's also true that solidarity is extremely messy. And for people on the left in the West, showing solidarity with people in other parts of the world can be more challenging or less challenging, especially if we're talking about people whose primary oppressors, whose primary concern, are geostrategic rivals of the United States. But I think that's all the more reason why it's important to have robust institutions to allow these conversations to happen in the way that Aziz was pointing out.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And we're going to do Part 2 and post it online at democracynow.org, Darryl Li of University of Chicago, as well as Aziz Rana of Cornell. I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh. Stay safe.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "Anti-immigration leftists have potential to upend German political scene\n\nState election results for Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance mean Russia-leaning populists could play decisive role\n\nIt was, Sahra Wagenknecht declared on the social media platform X on Sunday, \"a historic result\" achieved from almost a standing start. Within eight months, her leftwing-conservative Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) has gone from an upstart party of breakaway populists to a decisive player with the potential to upend the German political scene.\n\nThe BSW party's third place position in state elections in the eastern states of Thuringia (16%) and Saxony (12%), behind the centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), now puts it in the position of kingmaker.\n\nLike the other established mainstream parties, the BSW has scotched any possibility of entering into a formal coalition with the AfD, though it has not ruled out cooperation on subjects on which the parties are aligned. But its strong standing means negotiations in neither state can take place without it.\n\nAsked on Sunday night whether she was ready to negotiate for a position in the states' governments, Wagenknecht, 55, responded with an enigmatic smile. By Monday, she appeared triumphant, emboldened - and more open to the idea.\n\n\"This is a magnificent day,\" she said at a press conference flanked by the party's lead candidates from both states. \"We have become a power factor in Germany ... We can use that position to really move things in this country.\" The vote for the BSW, she added, was \"an expression of the mood in Germany\".\n\nWagenknecht's views are an eclectic mixture of left-leaning economics, anti-immigration rhetoric and a foreign policy grounded in suspicion of the US and residual support for Russia .\n\nFor years the face of Die Linke (The Left), the group born out of the former East German Communist party, Wagenknecht had often expressed frustration with conventional politics. In 2018 she launched Aufstehen (Get Up), a movement inspired by the gilets jaunes protests in France and the Jeremy Corbyn-supporting Momentum in the UK. And last autumn, after months of flirting with the idea, she quit Die Linke for good to form her eponymous party.\n\nUnder her leadership, and amid widespread dissatisfaction with the coalition government of Olaf Scholz , the BSW has stormed the political charts, quickly overtaking Die Linke, and efficiently using June's European parliamentary elections as a springboard to more prominence and popularity.\n\nIt has been described as filling a gap in the political landscape, by combining both leftwing and rightwing policies - campaigning on everything from more generous pensions and an increase in the minimum wage to constraining climate protection measures and toughening asylum regulations.\n\nLike the AfD, which rose to prominence on the coattails of disgruntlement over the former chancellor Angela Merkel's \"open door\" policy for refugees in 2015, Wagenknecht has benefited from the growing perception that Europe's largest economy is overburdened by refugees.\n\nBorn in Jena, in the state of Thuringia, Wagenknecht has been married for the past decade to 80-year-old Oskar Lafontaine, the former Social Democrats' (SPD) finance minister under Gerhard Schröder, before he too defected to Die Linke in protest over the SPD's labour reforms.\n\nThat divisive move is seen as a reminder of the havoc Wagenknecht could yet wreak on the CDU if its leader, Friedrich Merz, moves towards a hitherto unlikely and ideologically fraught alliance with the BSW. The party's general secretary, Carsten Linnemann, has done nothing to win her over, describing her as \"left, and/or right-wing extremist\", and \"communist\". His stance was dismissed as \"absurd\" by BSW's chairwoman, Amira Mohamed Ali, who said it might well impede a collaboration.\n\nMonday's press conference brought a flavour of the BSW's positioning. The party's successful candidates, Sabine Zimmermann for Saxony and Katja Wolf for Thuringia, spoke of the need to improve daily life, such as public transport, digitalisation in the health system, and standards in the classroom.\n\nFor her part, Wagenknecht was keener to emphasise her goals beyond state level: tackling the government's \"ruinous\" energy policy, halting the decision to station medium-range US missiles on German soil and criticising the notion that sending weapons to Ukraine- \"which plays into people's rage when school buildings are so dilapidated\" - can end the Russian invasion.\n\nWagenknecht walks a fine line geopolitically, not advocating for Germany's exit from the EU or Nato (unlike the AfD), but calling emphatically for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia for an end to the war. \"Diplomatic means had \"by no means\" been exhausted, she said on Monday\n\nA few years ago, Wagenknecht withdrew from the public arena, citing burnout , but now she has come back with a vengeance. The politician who was attacked with paint at an election rally in Erfurt last week, is now almost certain to be a leading - and deeply polarising - player in next year's federal election, scheduled for September 2025."

      "text": "What does left wing actually mean?\n\nThe Daily Mail's leaking of Mehdi Hasan's letter to Paul Dacre did not reveal Mehdi's hypocrisy, merely an uncomfortable truth: these days, if you want to write for any outlet, you will probably have to disregard profound political differences with it while capitalising on the ground you share.\n\nThat a leftwing journalist like Mehdi should admire some of the Mail's values while loathing others is almost inevitable. For though the model of a simple binary political division between the left and the right may have appeared plausible during the 1980s, today it no longer does, and boundaries are increasingly blurred.\n\nIn Britain, old-guard Bennite leftists consider it axiomatic that to be leftwing is to oppose western military intervention. Yet it was Tony Blair's Labour government that pioneered liberal interventionism via Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and Iraq, while much of the conservative right has reacted against the idea of risking British soldiers' lives to help foreigners.\n\nDavid Cameron - Blairite in foreign affairs - could not mobilise enough of his own parliamentary party to win the vote for intervention in Syria. Liberals are more likely to support intervention in defence of human rights and popular revolutions abroad, while conservatives often view dictators like Bashar al-Assad and Hosni Mubarak as positive factors of stability.\n\nHostility to immigration and Islam are the principal purposes of radical rightwingers in western Europe today. Yet they employ the language of class to oppose immigration, and portray a metropolitan elite prepared to sacrifice the culture and living standards of the white working-class in order to have more cheap babysitters and exotic restaurants.\n\nThey also raise the banners of women's rights and gay rights to attack Muslims and Islam. Conversely, some on the left are reluctant to criticise sexism, homophobia or anti-semitism among Muslims for fear of pandering to Islamophobia. Supporters of a niqab ban cite female emancipation while opponents cite freedom of expression; both draw upon liberal principles.\n\nOpposition to the EU is the Tory cause celebre, yet it was a Conservative prime minister, Edward Heath, who took Britain into the European Economic Community in 1973, while 10 years later it was Michael Foot's notoriously leftwing Labour opposition that advocated withdrawal.\n\nBritish liberals are more likely to be \"pro-Palestinian\" and conservatives \"pro-Israel\", yet the former often find themselves aligned with conservative Muslims on the issue and the latter with liberal Zionists. Gay marriage is viewed as a liberal cause, yet the institution of marriage is trumpeted primarily by conservatives.\n\nConservatives like to claim that the right is inherently anti-state while the left is pro-state. Yet Republican president George W Bush presided over a huge expansion in the US federal government, while anarchists are arguably the most leftwing and anti-state of all.\n\nGreen politics are generally viewed as leftwing, yet many greens and conservatives share common ground, whether in their dislike of modern industrial society, love of the countryside, idealisation of traditional small farmers or fear of developing world population growth.\n\nOpposition to abortion is usually viewed as a rightwing cause. Yet the US is home to a burgeoning liberal and feminist pro-life movement, while even conservative pro-lifers have taken up the causes of traditionally marginalised groups that are targeted in abortions - not only the babies themselves but also disabled people in the west and women in India and China.\n\nConversely, supporters of abortion adopt the rhetoric of unconstrained personal autonomy and self-interested choice that echoes the values of the libertarian right.\n\nLooked at closely, there are few issues that are strictly left v right. In fact, there is only one: the left supports the redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor while the right opposes it. All genuinely left v right questions are derivative of that.\n\nAgain, the categories are subverted, as policies generally seen as rightwing - introducing university tuition fees; cutting benefits - are sold as redistributing money toward industrious working-class families. Nevertheless, Britain's present coalition government deserves to be labelled rightwing, as its principal purpose has been to preside over a large-scale transfer of wealth away from the working and ordinary middle classes and toward the wealthy.\n\nConsequently, to be leftwing in Britain today is to side with popular resistance to the government's anti-redistributive policies; with anti-austerity protesters and striking workers; with those who campaign to defend their public services and welfare state.\n\nThis makes the left-right divide an important separation in British and international politics, but far from the only one. Leftists and rightists are as likely as not to find themselves on the same side of a political dispute; for example, to agree over military intervention while disagreeing over spending cuts.\n\nTo cling to a \"leftwing\" or \"rightwing\" tag may primarily reflect one's sense of identity and emotional need to belong to one tribe and to define oneself against the other. Yet at least occasionally, every principled and free-thinking individual must disagree with the tribe."

      "text": "The Searchers by Andy Beckett review - the leftists who took their lead from Tony Benn\n\nAn absorbing study of five Labour radicals - Jeremy Corbyn, Diane Abbott, John McDonnell, Ken Livingstone, plus Benn himself - makes a convincing case for their cultural victories but romanticises Corbyn's years as the party's leader\n\nT his might seem like an eccentric book. As Labour prepares for power after four consecutive general election defeats, Andy Beckett is interested not in what is to come but what has just been. He is particularly preoccupied by the rise of Jeremy Corbyn , what happened to him as party leader and what his leadership represented. The Searchers is mostly fair-minded, diligently reported and researched, but leaves you in no doubt that Beckett, a Guardian columnist, is a sympathetic Corbynite.\n\nIn the long, final section, covering 2015 to the present day, Beckett writes nostalgically about the excitement of the early years of Corbyn's leadership when the left, for so long ridiculed, traduced and marginalised (Peter Mandelson joked during the era of New Labour dominance that they had been contained in a \"sealed tomb\"), seized control of the party and unlocked a spirit of radical countercultural optimism, especially among younger voters.\n\nThe author misses those days but in seeking to recreate the social atmosphere of the country during that period he is perhaps too forgiving of Corbyn's failures, anti-Zionist zeal and toxic associations. Not forgetting his crass stupidity. This was demonstrated, most emphatically, by his response to the Novichok nerve agent poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a former Soviet military intelligence officer, and his daughter in Salisbury in 2018 when the Labour leader gave the benefit of the doubt to Putin's Kremlin .\n\nIn 2023 Beckett attended a Bernie Sanders event at the Royal Festival Hall in London. The cross-class social mix and febrile mood reminded him of old Corbyn rallies. \"The audience was multiracial, male and female in roughly equal proportions ... It did not look like a Britain whose political time had gone for good.\"\n\nBut London is not Britain. The Corbyn events that Beckett attended while reporting for the book were invariably in London - or Bristol and Brighton, cities with similar demographics to the vibrant multicultural capital. We never encounter him in those faraway Brexit-supporting former Labour towns in which Corbyn and his movement were loathed.\n\nBut this is not just a book about Corbyn and Corbynism. The Searchers has larger ambitions and more broadly is an absorbing history of Labour's radical left from the late 1960s to its present marginalisation. It is also a series of interconnected mini-biographies - of Tony Benn and the four prominent politicians who were inspired by him: Ken Livingstone , Diane Abbott, John McDonnell and Corbyn.\n\nBeckett's Gang of Four (as I shall call them) were all products of the London left. Livingstone and McDonnell worked together in the 1980s, respectively, as leader and deputy leader of the Greater London Council (GLC), which championed municipal socialism and delighted in tormenting Margaret Thatcher. Her response: she abolished the GLC in 1986.\n\nAbbott, a former TV journalist, reported on the GLC and later worked as a press officer for it. She was encouraged by its embrace of minority rights and identity politics. The GLC back then was widely mocked as \"loony left\", but its equity, inclusion and diversity policies are now mainstream.\n\nCorbyn, who later had a relationship with Abbott, moved to London after working with the Voluntary Service Overseas scheme in Jamaica and then travelling through Chile, where he observed the rise of Salvador Allende, the elected socialist president whose Popular Unity government was toppled in a US-backed coup in 1973. (The fall of Allende was a cautionary tale for the internationalist left.)\n\nOn his return to England, Corbyn, who had messed up his A-levels, studied desultorily at North London Polytechnic before working for several trade unions. He became the MP for Islington North in 1983, the same year that Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were elected to parliament (Livingstone and Abbott were elected in 1987; McDonnell in 1997).\n\nThe Gang of Four shared a politics and were inspired by Benn's campaign to empower members and activists in pursuit of \"change from below\" and greater party democracy. They supported Benn's attempt to win the deputy leadership in 1981, a bitter sectarian struggle against Denis Healey that poisoned Labour for a generation. As a restless, technocratic senior minister in Harold Wilson's governments, Benn had become disillusioned with the resistance his reforming ideas had encountered, from within the civil service and his own party. Through the 1970s he moved further to the left.\n\nThe Gang of Four were \"Bennites\" but had different styles and methods. Livingstone was the Machiavel of County Hall, a pragmatist and dealmaker. \"There's no permanent friendships [in politics],\" he told Beckett. He was ruthless in achieving what he wanted but, in the end, was a local rather than national hero. His rise in the parliamentary party was thwarted by Neil Kinnock. \"He hated the London left,\" Abbott said of the former party leader.\n\nMcDonnell was an uncompromising ideologue and, according to Beckett, a Gramscian. He was an autodidact, having gone to Brunel University as a mature student. He was from an Irish-Catholic Liverpudlian family and considered becoming a priest. He was patient and relentless and would later emerge as the de facto leader of the parliamentary left and chair of the Socialist Campaign Group, which is now a demoralised faction.\n\nMcDonnell was the Corbynite who impressed me most when I interviewed him. He was interested in big ideas and political economy. He was a hard worker, shrewd strategist and desperately wanted to win. And he had a theory of history and of how he wanted to transform the state. For McDonnell, Corbynism was a counter-hegemonic project. For Corbyn himself, the accidental leader, not so much.\n\nThe young Corbyn was a rabble-rouser and agitator. He was intoxicated by the upheavals and student rebellions of the late 1960s and the world of leftwing politics as he found it in London: the radical magazines, the rallies, the festivals, the demonstrations. He relished protest but was a reluctant frontman and had intellectual insecurities. He agreed only to run for the leadership in 2015 because both McDonnell (twice) and Abbott had tried and failed before him, and the Socialist Campaign Group wanted to be represented in the contest. During a brilliant campaign, he unequivocally rejected austerity and spoke directly in a manner that inspired activists who were weary of the tortured triangulations of senior Labour politicians. Corbyn won convincingly but was overwhelmingly rejected by the parliamentary party. A long civil war had begun.\n\nAbbott was a true pioneer, a state school Cambridge graduate and the first black female MP. She was an adept media performer as well as being a passionate campaigner for racial, sexual and gender equality. Perhaps no other modern MP has suffered more sustained abuse and vilification and today Abbott is an unhappy exile within the party. She, like Corbyn, is stained by accusations of antisemitism.\n\nThe book shares a title with John Ford's great western, from 1956, starring John Wayne as a Confederate veteran of the American civil war. He embarks on a quest, in the desert landscape of west Texas, to find his niece whom he believes has been kidnapped by members of the Comanche Native American tribe. What were the searchers of Andy Beckett's book looking for?\n\nThey were looking for a lot of things but most strikingly for an enduring socialist alternative. They were opposed to rampant capitalism, entrenched privilege, social conservatism and American hegemony. They were economically statist and socially ultra-liberal. On social and cultural matters, Beckett writes, \"the left has won so many battles that its victory has become invisible\".\n\nSo why the ultimate disappointment, why the sense of lost opportunity that flows like an underground stream through the book? The answer, I think, is that when it mattered most, when they had the opportunity to lead the Labour party to power and effect the political and economic transformation for which they had long campaigned, Corbyn, McDonnell and Abbott were abjectly defeated by Boris Johnson, the clown prince of Tory politics. They told the people who they were and what they wanted and the message in return was: \"Enough. No more!\" The tomb had been resealed. It is now left for Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves to lead Labour into a new era of government.\n\nJason Cowley is editor of the New Statesman\n\nThe Searchers: Five Rebels, Their Dream of a Different Britain, and Their Many Enemies by Andy Beckett is published by Allen Lane (£30).

      "text": "Cuban leftists begin to turn their fire on the 'harmful practices of the state'\n\nLeading radicals are raising their voices against the demand for uncritical backing for the government\n\nLuis Emilio Aybar is a voice from the left, which in Cuba means pretty far left . By any measure, he should be a stalwart defender of the island's communist regime. After widespread public protests that two weeks ago roiled the nation, the 34-year-old published an article in the magazine La Tizza , which bills itself as \"a space to think about socialism\".\n\nAfter the prerequisite denunciation of the US, he wrote: \"What happened on 11 July is also because we communists and revolutionaries do not fight with sufficient force and efficiency the harmful practices of the state.\n\n\"We defend unity in a way that actually harms it ... We uncritically follow our leaders instead of rectifying their path. We agree to be disciplined, when what we have to do is think and act with our own heads.\" In authoritarian Cuba , that sounded a lot like heresy.\n\nCuba has always split international opinion. Its detractors are perhaps best represented by the US senator Marco Rubio, who called the island \"the only country in the world where Cubans can't succeed\".\n\nIn turn, its supporters brook little criticism. Helen Yaffe, an author and academic from Glasgow University, recently arrived on the island, swiftly joining a government rally called by the government. Afterwards she declared on Novara Media: \"No one should underestimate the resilience of the Cuban revolution.\"\n\nWithin Cuba, the regime has long demanded such support, calling detractors gusanos , or worms. Yet the sight of thousands of Cubans taking to the streets to complain about a lack of food, medicines and electricity seems to have caused cracks to appear.\n\nSilvio Rodríguez is Cuba's best-known singer-songwriter, a 74-year-old international superstar widely recognised as living his socialist values. In non-pandemic times, he stages monthly free concerts in the poorer barrios of Havana.\n\nLast week, however, he met the dissident playwright Yunior Garcia, who had been arrested during the protests. They discussed the unrest and the government's heavy-handed response.\n\nShortly afterwards, Rodríguez called for the release of all those who had not resorted to violence. \"There must be less prejudice,\" he said. \"[There must be] more desire to solve the mountain of pending economic and political issues.\"\n\nCriticism such as this has put the government on the defensive. It says the island has been subject to a wave of disinformation from the US.\n\nCarlos Fernández de Cossío is Cuba's point-man on the US, and second only to the foreign minister in importance at the ministry of foreign affairs. He insisted that claims that protesters had \"disappeared\" into jails and interrogation centres were just not true. \"There are people who have been detained and there are people that have been arrested, those that have violated the law,\" he said, although he would not give numbers. Independent media claim up to 650 people were detained, although many have now been released.\n\nAsked what he thought had brought Cubans on to the streets, De Cossío replied: \"Well, it wasn't capitalism.\"\n\nThe protesters had cried \" libertad \", freedom, and \" patria y vida \", homeland and life, the title of an anti-government song . The shortages they face are the result of Cuba running out of foreign currency, a situation hastened by the pandemic devastating an economy reliant on tourism.\n\nDe Cossío blamed the 60-year-old US trade embargo, tightened to strangulation by Donald Trump and kept in place by Joe Biden. He said there had actually been more conversations with Washington during Trump's presidency than Biden's. \"There's no dialogue at this moment,\" he said.\n\nYet in his essay for La Tizza , Aybar strayed surprisingly close to another analysis, summarised by the Financial Times when it called Cuba a last \"lonely outpost of Marxist central planning\".\n\n\"During 2020, half of the country's investments were allocated to hotel construction at a time when there was a drastic decrease in international tourism and an acute shortage of investment in agriculture,\" he wrote. He said 11 July needed to be a watershed. \"A failure to pressure the government from the left means that the right will take the initiative\", meaning \"more market, more private property, less education and public health.\"\n\nOnly time will reveal whether internal reform will satisfy the population. Another increasingly robust critic from within, Cuba's former ambassador to the EU, Carlos Alzugaray, believes it will have to. He has just published an article saying it is \"essential\" that the government \"not make the mistake of blaming only external factors\".\n\nHe was watching the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics on television as he pointed out that, despite the efforts of critics in the US, regimes such as China, Vietnam and Cuba have proved durable, and \"very difficult to overthrow\". It is his view that Cuba should follow China and Vietnam towards \"a market economy with socialist orientation\".\n\nBefore he could get into that - or the government's potential reaction to the criticism from within - the pride in Cuba's sovereignty that has always been a far greater and more unifying force than communism on the island revealed itself.\n\nThe 69 athletes Cuba has sent to the Olympics appeared in the famous parade. Alzugaray faltered, his voice suddenly breaking with emotion.\n\nThis is the archive of The Observer up until 21/04/2025. The Observer is now owned and operated by Tortoise Media."

      "text": "How a disastrous change in perspective disempowered the left and let the right rise\n\nBy dismissing the masses as fools, progressives confirmed all the culture warriors' claims\n\nIn August 2001, the radical writer and film-maker Michael Moore presented HarperCollins with the manuscript later known as Stupid White Men. It was still being edited when the September 11 attack occurred. In the newly hyper-patriotic environment, the publisher baulked at releasing a book ridiculing George W Bush and the Republican administration, with chapters entitled Kill Whitey! and A Very American Coup.\n\nMoore was instructed to revise substantially a work that would, HarperCollins decreed, appear under the more palatable title Michael Moore: the American. That extraordinary editorial intervention, which ostensibly came directly from Rupert Murdoch himself, attracted the attention of a group of librarians. The outraged book-lovers publicised Moore's predicament with sufficient vigour to ensure the text's release in its original form.\n\nOn the first day of its release, Stupid White Men sold all 50,000 copies of its print run - and by its fifth day was on its ninth printing. Quickly, it became a defining statement of opposition to the Bush administration in the early phases of the \"war on terror\".\n\nMoore had grown up in the union town of Flint, Michigan, and in many respects his book was an excoriation of the new administration for its cruel indifference to blue-collar Americans. But his title also reflected, as the anti-corporate global justice movement with which he'd been associated disintegrated, the new hegemony of what we might call \"smug politics\".\n\nStupid White Men echoed a conviction common among progressives as soon as George W Bush took power: namely, the man was an idiot. It was not an unreasonable suggestion. President Bush possessed, for instance, an extraordinary ability to mangle the English language.\n\n\"Our nation must come together to unite,\" he explained at one point. \"Is our children learning?\" he said on another occasion.\n\n\"Families,\" Bush said, during a third speech, \"is where our nation finds hope, where wings take dream.\"\n\nIn 2003, the journalist Frank Bruni explained that \"the Bush I knew was part scamp and part bumbler, a timeless fraternity boy and heedless cutup, a weekday gym rat and weekend napster\". The president apparently loved fart jokes, and would let rip in front of new aides, confident that intentional flatulence helped the fresh appointees to settle in. When he received news of the September 11 terror attacks, Bush didn't, at first, react - video footage that featured heavily in a subsequent Moore documentary showed him placidly continuing to read to schoolchildren from a book entitled The Pet Goat, as if he couldn't grasp the magnitude of the catastrophe.\n\nConsiderable evidence could thus be adduced for the Bush-was-a-moron theory.\n\nBut what followed politically? If Bush was the stupidest of the stupid white men, how had he come to power? Who had voted for him? Most of all, why weren't ordinary people rising up against the dangerous buffoon who ruled them?\n\nMoore's book drew a simple conclusion. \"[I]f you live in a country,\" he wrote, \"where 44 million can't read - and perhaps close to another 200 million can read but usually don't - well, friends, you and I are living in one very scary place.\" The moron president remained in power because the American people were themselves moronic. Stupid White Men described Bush as the \"idiot leader of an idiot nation\", and explained that \"it comes as no surprise to foreigners that Americans, who love to revel in their stupidity, would 'elect' a president who rarely reads anything - including his own briefing papers\".\n\nThis was smug politics at its most overt, not just in the assessment of Americans as people \"who love to revel in their stupidity\", but in its implication that the reader (\"you and I\") was, like Moore himself, smarter than the ordinary dopes whom the book discussed.\n\nThese formulations simply inverted the culture-war themes of the right. The Republican electoral campaign had, after all, contrasted George W Bush's folksiness with the supposed superciliousness of his opponent, Al Gore.\n\nThe September 11 atrocity and the outbreak of the \"war on terror\" facilitated the Republican efforts to build on this image. Bush became a war president - but a war president of a special type. His minders cast him as John Wayne: a hero, to be sure, but also an everyman, whose greatness distilled the values of the heartland.\n\nWhen Bush (who'd enlisted as a fighter pilot in Texas to evade the Vietnam War) arrived on an aircraft carrier in a flying suit to declare victory in Iraq, the NBC pundit Chris Matthews hosted Watergate felon Gordon Liddy to discuss his appearance.\n\n\"You know, he's in his flight suit,\" said Liddy. \"He's striding across the deck, and he's wearing his parachute harness ... and it makes the best of his manly characteristic. ... He has just won every woman's vote in the United States of America. You know, all those women who say size doesn't count - they're all liars.\"\n\nThis grotesque exchange (and many others like it) provided credence to Moore's assessment of American idiocy. Here was a political culture at rock bottom, with sycophantic journalists enthusing about how the president, unlike his effete opponents, possessed a large penis.\n\nYet Moore's argument that the people themselves were responsible for Bush's antics implicitly reinforced the Republican case. The right equated the president with the American electorate, and distinguished them both from sneering elitists. Moore did exactly the same - except with the polarities reversed. Conservatives insisted the people and their leaders were wise; Moore judged them both moronic.\n\nThe first position was, for obvious reasons, far more politically successful than the second.\n\nThe decline of the traditional leftwing infrastructure - parties, organisations, NGOs and the like - that previously might have given progressives a platform meant that leftwing or liberal celebrities took on an especial cultural significance during the Bush years. For many people on the left - especially as the internet became mainstream - politics became a matter of applauding or sharing an intervention by one or another progressive public figure. To cater to this need, a particular style of humour developed, associated with Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart and similar figure. Throughout the Bush years, progressives kept up their morale by blogging about the latest sketch in which Stewart cut some Fox News blowhard or another down to size.\n\nYet such victories were always pyrrhic, since the ever-present snark of smug politics affirmed the right's new-class theory even as it mocked it.\n\nThe academic Jay Rosen identified something he called \"the cult of savviness\" within professionalism journalism. By savviness, he meant the quality of being knowing, ironic, perceptive, shrewd and unsentimental. \"Savviness is what journalists admire in others,\" Rosen wrote. \"Savvy is what they themselves dearly wish to be. (And to be unsavvy is far worse than being wrong.)\"\n\nThe smug politics of the Bush era depended on the progressive embrace of savviness. The Daily Show-style gags only worked for a savvy crowd. Such jokes weren't intended to convince anyone. In fact, almost by their nature, they couldn't convince anyone. To get the sketch - which often consisted of little more than a clip of a conservative saying something stupid, followed by the liberal host mugging to the camera in mock amazement - the audience needed to already know and already accept the correct position.\n\nThe new mode of smug politics was perfectly represented in the 2006 movie Idiocracy, a satire that presented the United States of the future as a dystopia dominated by overweight morons who spent their lives masturbating, eating junk food and watching programs like Ow! My Balls! The film outlined its set-up by explaining that American society had reversed evolution, allowing the foolish to breed while the intelligent remained childless. As a result, progressive and enlightened individuals were swamped by the backwardness of the great unwashed.\n\nLiberals may not have said openly that they regarded ordinary people as so stupid that their procreation threatened civilisation itself. Yet as a satire, Idiocracy spelled out the deep elitism embedded in the prevailing critique of conservatism.\n\nThe consolatory power of the \"idiot nation\" trope was obvious. If voters were slack-jawed rubes, well, it couldn't be the fault of progressives that protests were small or that leftwing ideas lacked purchase. Activists committed to smug politics could take comfort knowing that the masses were too dumb to grasp the cogent arguments being presented to them.\n\nBut, politically, such rhetoric was disastrous. By dismissing the people as fools, progressives confirmed everything the culture warriors said: they openly embraced the condescending stereotype of the liberal elitist.\n\nPolitical analyst Thomas Frank made the point that, despite the new-class presentation of progressives as elites, most leftists and liberals were not, and had never been, wealthy or powerful. Nevertheless, Frank argued, the increasing reliance on celebrities and the media meant that many ordinary people encountered progressive ideas in, say, magazine articles, where, as he put it, \"singers who were big in the 70s express their concern with neatly folded ribbons for this set of victims or that\". In such settings, progressive causes seemed \"a matter of shallow appearances, of fatuous self-righteousness ... a politics in which the beautiful and the wellborn tell the unwashed and the beaten down how they should stop being racist or homophobic, how they should be better people\".\n\nThroughout the 60s and the early 70s, most progressive activists had seen \"the people\" (however that term was defined) as the solution to a sexist, racist oppression associated with the wealthy and the powerful. Increasingly, though, many progressives identified the masses not as the answer but as the problem, a foolish and slightly terrifying reservoir of cultural and political backwardness. This disastrous perspective - an implicit confirmation of the case being made by conservative culture warriors - would play an important role in the right's ongoing successes.\n\nThis is an edited extract from Trigger Warnings: Political Correctness and the Rise of the Right by Jeff Sparrow, published by Scribe on 1 October."

It was organised by the Czech exile Jan Kavan, who went on to become a senior Social Democratic politician and foreign minister of the Czech Republic after the collapse of communism in 1989.\n\nI am proud to say that I was one of maybe dozens of British anti-Stalinist leftists posing as ordinary tourists who smuggled banned literature, documents and even illegal movie cameras across the heavily policed Czech border during that period. These nerve-racking trips were undertaken in an adapted camper van, fitted with cleverly designed secret compartments. Once in Prague we met various brave oppositionists, mainly at night, to hand over the banned materials. Jan Kavan was our liaison man in London who organised these trips, and as far as I know none of Kavan's couriers were ever detected. Sadly my companion on the trip I made in 1974, Peter Gowan, an academic in eastern European studies, died several years ago.\n\nI am now 76, and if asked to undertake a similar trip today to a repressive regime, I would do it again - although I have obviously now blown my cover. I would love to meet up with other couriers who undertook similar journeys, to share our experiences. Carl Gardner London\n\nYour report of the CIA smuggling the Guardian Weekly along with books into eastern Europe during the cold war ( Report, 22 February ) brought to mind my father's efforts to the same end. In defiance of the censors, for three years after the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia he engaged in an intense and sustained correspondence with a Czech doctor. In June 1970, the doctor thanked him for the Guardian Weekly and \"your hilarious letters sandwiched into its pages\".\n\nA few weeks later, acknowledging the arrival of a some saxophone reeds for his son, he noted \"how carefully and skilfully you are always wrapping the packet with the Guardian\". Fortunately the flow of letters, newspapers and a judicious selection of books, intended to offer some hope and relief from isolation, were never cut off, although sometimes opened by the censors. My father of course had nothing to do with the CIA, being a member of the British Communist party.

      "text": "Meet the groups trying to create a new leftwing party - and channel the energy missing from Starmer's Labour\n\nAs disenchantment grows with mainstream parties, these collectives argue that the time is right - but there will be big obstacles\n\nE ver since Keir Starmer began shoving Labour rightwards in 2020, a space has been opening up in British politics. The limited enthusiasm for Labour at the election and since has widened that space further, as has a more general dissatisfaction: a common feeling that our party system doesn't properly represent voters on many issues, from inequality to Gaza.\n\nUntil recently, the pandemic and then the protracted collapse of the Conservative government distracted most people from this void to the left of Labour. The fact that the more radical leadership of his predecessor ended badly , with Labour's heavy 2019 defeat, also discouraged further leftwing experiments. Of the many thousands who had been drawn in by Corbynism, some left Labour for the Greens, while others gave up on party politics, threatening to become a lost generation of progressives.\n\nYet now this period of depression and relative inactivity on the left may be ending. At public and private meetings, in online discussions, independent parliamentary campaigns and other mobilisations, a growing range of leftists, from young ex-Corbynistas to union veterans, are becoming convinced that a new leftwing party is both necessary and timely.\n\n\"There is a political opening,\" says a former senior adviser to Jeremy Corbyn who, like many of those exploring the possibility of a new party, prefers to speak anonymously. \"There's a good chunk of the population in the progressive tent who thought a Labour government would be a change in that direction. But Starmer is proving Labour can't be.\"\n\nThrough expulsions and suspensions , Starmer is also demonstrating that Labour won't tolerate dissenters, as it generally has in the past. To some British socialists, setting up an alternative to Labour increasingly seems a necessity rather than a luxury. Meanwhile, the electoral system's strong bias against new parties is showing signs of breaking down, as public opinion fragments, with five Labour seats falling to leftwing independents at the last election.\n\nIn September, they formed a parliamentary group , the Independent Alliance. The same month, a private meeting was held by Collective , an organisation founded this spring to \" drive the formation of a new, mass-membership political party of the left\". Attenders included Len McCluskey, the former general secretary of the trade union Unite, Karie Murphy, Corbyn's former chief of staff, Corbyn himself, Jamie Driscoll, the former Labour mayor of North of Tyne, plus an array of leftwing, non-Labour former parliamentary candidates. \"Now is the time,\" says a Collective promotional video , \"to take on both the Labour-Tory establishment and our rigged political system.\"\n\nAlso this autumn, an ongoing series of public meetings has been held in Bethnal Green in east London under the heading Party Time? . At each, a couple of hundred leftwing activists, thinkers and the politically curious have squeezed into an inadequately sized room for two hours or more, to explore whether and in what form a party should be created. The meetings have been noisy, enthusiastic, participatory, argumentative, full of articulate millennials and a little self-mocking - with an MC bellowing, \"Good evening, comrades!\" - just as many leftist gatherings were during the most expansive and effective phase of Corbynism. \"There's a lot of pent-up energy,\" says one of the organisers of Party Time?. \"We're making the road by walking.\"\n\nOver the past 30 years, a succession of new British leftwing parties have made that claim: Respect, Left Unity, the Socialist party, the Socialist Labour party, the Scottish Socialist party, the Socialist Alliance, the Workers party. Some have won a few parliamentary seats. But none have sustained their momentum for long, often being derailed by splits and domineering personalities , which are especially damaging for small parties without deep social roots.\n\nWhy should things be different this time? People involved with Collective and Party Time? argue that the political context is much more favourable, with leftwing Britons more numerous, Labour more unpopular and the country's problems less soluble by centrist means than during the relatively placid late 20th and early 21st century, when most of these largely forgotten parties were launched. A new leftwing force that appealed to the young would also have stronger social roots: \"graduates without a future\", as a Party Time? source puts it. Meanwhile, the weakness of the Conservatives makes it harder for Labour to warn, and for left-of-centre voters to worry, that supporting a new party will let the Tories in.\n\nYet plenty of difficult questions remain. Will Collective and Party Time? unite or compete? When should a new party be launched? Some say within months, perhaps in time for next May's local elections. Others say much more slowly: as a social movement first, which through community activism gradually wins enough respect to become a party. Where can it get funding? Most unions remain loyal to Labour. How should it appeal beyond disgruntled leftists? The white working-class and minority-ethnic voters it could attract, as an anti-status-quo party, often support Reform or Labour. And if it does take off, how should it maximise its power? By being an aggressive rival to Labour and the Greens - or by working with their radical elements in official or unofficial alliances? People involved in Party Time? repeatedly cited to me how Nigel Farage had radicalised the Tories.\n\nThe Labour right may actually be happy to face a new leftwing party. By attracting Labour dissidents, it could complete Starmer's purge of the left. There is already talk of Labour MPs defecting. About one who is currently suspended from the parliamentary party for opposing the two-child benefit cap, a Party Time? source says: \"I know members of [their] team have had an eye on our discussions.\" The Labour right's calculation may be that defections would do little electoral damage.\n\nBut we live in a time when centrists' predictions often prove foolishly complacent, while rebels thrive against expectations. At the least, the left's talk of starting afresh shows that Labour is alienating many socialists. Sooner or later, this dissatisfaction will bring Labour's century-old dominance of our left-of-centre politics to an end.\n\nAndy Beckett is a Guardian columnist"

      "text": "'Critical race theory' is the right's new bogeyman. The left must not fall for it\n\nRightwing politicians and media outlets are attacking a strawman version of antiracism. A disappointing number of liberals and leftists have bought into it\n\nT here is a specter haunting America - the specter of critical race theory. That, at least, is the impression you would get from rightwing media. Fox News has mentioned the term close to 1,300 times since March - including almost 250 times last week alone.\n\nIf you don't know, critical race theory (CRT) is a school of legal thought that argues that racism is not only a problem of prejudices held by individual human beings, but a structural problem that can be embedded in ostensibly neutral laws and government institutions. Thanks in part to efforts by conservative activists to turn this previously esoteric academic idea into a catch-all phrase for the excesses of anti-racist politics, critical race theory has become an overnight bogeyman of the right. Conservative politicians in at least 20 states are pushing legislation to ban its teaching in schools.\n\nRather than critically engaging with critical race theory, rightwing politicians and media outlets prefer to attack a carefully constructed straw man version - transforming \"the academic study of structural racism into a vague grab-bag of villainy\", in the words of the New Republic's Alex Shepard. Just as conservatives attacked anything to the left of the far right as \"communist\" during the red scare of the 1960s, reactionaries today denounce anything with a whiff of anti-racism as \"critical race theory\" or \"wokeness\" run amok.\n\nIt makes sense that a conservative movement that has connected its fate to Donald Trump and a white supremacist agenda would see anything that criticizes the racist structures of the country as a major threat. What is more puzzling, at least at first glance, is the ire that critical race theory has also drawn from some leftwing and liberal camps. Some liberal media outlets seem almost as obsessed as conservatives are with critical race theory, \"cancel culture\", \"identity politics\" and the like - phenomena which they treat as interchangeable symptoms of the same political malaise. Just look at the onslaught of critical pieces about identity politics and \" wokeness \" in the opinion pages of the New York Times over the past several years.\n\nIn the eyes of some liberals and leftists, perhaps most famously personified by the academic Mark Lilla, emphasizing race and racism distracts from the real progressive struggle between labor and capital. Across the western world, mostly old white men are lining up to warn us that the \"working class\" (read: nativist white workers) feels betrayed by center-left parties that cater to \"cosmopolitans\" or \"urbanites\" with \"symbolic\" politics about issues such as gender-neutral bathrooms, rather than offer real material remedies on traditional bread-and-butter issues.\n\nWhat they do not see - or do not want to see - is that economic issues and cultural issues are not neatly separated; if anything, they are intimately intertwined, and always have been. Nostalgia for the golden age of progressivism (the early 20th century in the US, and the 1960s and 1970s in western Europe) ignores that the social democratic welfare state was built on heteronormativity, patriarchy and white supremacy. Many state provisions were provided on the basis of a \"traditional\" family model, in which the man was the main or sole breadwinner and the woman took care of the kids. And white workers were able to achieve upward mobility in part because immigrants replaced them in less desirable, lower-paid jobs.\n\nUnfortunately, some younger liberals, often self-described centrists or classical liberals, share the older left's reflexive hostility to racial and sexual politics and what they view as excessive radicalism. Take Persuasion , a relatively new online publication created by Yascha Mounk, who made his name as a fervent critic of rightwing populism and Donald Trump. In many ways, the publication is a typical product of the Trump era, set up to \" defend the values of a free society \" against Trump. But from the beginning the bulk of Persuasion's articles have focused on criticizing the left, whether in the forms of unduly \"woke\" Americans or the nominally socialist authoritarian regime of Venezuela. The far right, including the Trumpist Republican party, increasingly seems like an afterthought.\n\nAnti-identity-politics leftists and liberals must stop acting as the useful idiots of the far right by advancing its pet issues and terminology. These campaigns against anti-racism might look ridiculous on Fox News, but they have real consequences in legislatures and statehouses across the country, where Republican politicians are using the bogeyman of critical race theory and identity politics to ram reactionary rhetoric into law. Coast to coast, Republican lawmakers have unleashed the most profound attack on democracy that this country has seen in decades. Leftists and liberals must recognize that the true enemy of both the working class and free society is on the right, and that its threat is still at least as serious as it was in 2016.\n\nCas Mudde is Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, the author of The Far Right Today (2019), and host of the podcast Radikaal .

      "text": "The liberal-left divide reshaping American politics\n\nTrump's opponents are bitterly split. You can't understand US politics today unless you understand the rift between liberals and leftwingers. By Pete Davis\n\nI t has been almost a year since the catastrophic election of Donald Trump. In his first year in office, the president has governed as cruelly and ineptly as his critics predicted. But while anti-Trump sentiment has never been more fierce and widespread, his political opponents are more divided than ever. And this faultline - which has parallels in Britain with divisions among the Labour party - could, if left unaddressed, compromise efforts to resist and defeat Trumpism.\n\nRoughly speaking, these two sides could be characterised as the \"populist wing\" and the \"establishment wing\" of the Democratic party, but even this terminology is a point of controversy between the feuding sides. The party's left wing, for example, wants to call the conflict the \"left-liberal divide\". Loyalist Democrats want to play down the divide, calling for unity by insisting that Democrats are all members of \"the left\" (if those calling for unity are younger, millennial types), or that they are all \"liberals\" (if they are older, Clinton-era types). The right, meanwhile, does not understand the divide, continuing to believe in a monolithic \"radical left\" filled with \"radical liberals\". This leads to the funny situation, as one commentator noted, in which members of both the left and the right reach for the same \"I made it through college without becoming a liberal\" T-shirt.\n\nThe present conflict surfaced, as many intra-party feuds do, during a presidential primary. But unlike past internal conflicts, this one is sticking around. Centrist John Kerry supporters, for example, did not take potshots at insurgent Howard Dean supporters deep into 2005. This year, however, a full ecosystem - replete with duelling podcasts, magazines and candidates - has kept the divide alive. Skirmishes are popping up, like clockwork, every few weeks; from February's bitterly contested election of a new Democratic National Committee chair, to leftist scepticism about potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris ; from the launching of the Clinton-fawning website Verrit to the latest harangue from the liberal-bashing podcast Chapo Trap House .\n\nDiscussing a resolution to this conflict is difficult, because even calls for \"resolution\" can be interpreted as ideological statements. Wanting the Democratic party to survive and unify can be taken as an endorsement of the establishment, because the quickest path to intra-party peace is for the conflict's leftwing instigators to get in line. Meanwhile, treating the intraparty divide as substantive - arguing that there is, in fact, a significant difference between, say, \" Medicare for All \" and \"Obamacare\" - can annoy liberals who believe that the so-called \"divide\" has been manufactured by a few disgruntled purists.\n\nTo resolve our intra-party conflict, we must first understand it. I believe the two sides' concerns can be grouped into three divides: the first over party loyalty, the second over how to win elections, and the third over the gap between Democrats and Republicans . Each divide may not be relevant to every partisan in the conflict, but most partisans have divided over at least one of these three.\n\nLiberals accuse leftwingers of not being loyal to the party in general elections. This began with the vilification of leftwing third-party voters, such as Ralph Nader voters in 2000 and Jill Stein voters in 2016 . What made this past election special is that accusations of disloyalty were launched at a Democratic primary challenger. Hillary Clinton supporters feel that Bernie Sanders attacked Clinton excessively during the primary, stayed in the primary too long, and did not do enough to support her in the general election. Many loyal Democrats around the country have analogous feelings about leftwing rebels in the party generally: they think criticisms should be kept inside the family, and that it is important to be a \"team player\" in order to win elections and pass legislation. Some may call these loyal Democrats boring conformists, but from their perspective, it is party loyalists, not insurgent critics, who staff the party booth at the county fair and knock on doors every year to help get Democrats elected.\n\nLeftists, on the other hand, believe this \"disloyalty\" accusation is bunk. First, they think establishment-wing leaders follow what the political blogger Jonathan Schwartz has called \"the iron law of institutions\", which says that \"the people who control institutions care first and foremost about their power within the institution rather than the power of the institution itself\". If party leaders were loyal to the party, leftwingers believe, then they would have learned from recent electoral losses and shaken the party up, even if it meant stepping aside themselves to make room for fresh faces and new ideas.\n\nSecond, insurgent leftwingers care less about catering to the dwindling group of grassroots party loyalists around the country, and more about activating the masses of non-voters and independents who are not yet loyal to any party. That is why they are less concerned about candidates, like Sanders, who are not technically Democrats. They see them not as selfish traitors, but rather as opportunities to build the party's base.\n\nLoyalty to the party generally is often bound up in loyalty to party leaders. The party's liberal wing tends to get excited about party leaders' personalities, and is more likely to share, say, Obama or Hillary memes, watch West Wing fantasies about party staffers and follow the path of rising stars. This loyalty extends to the wider network tied to the party, too, such as liberal-leaning news anchors and commentators, and party-aligned Hollywood stars such as Meryl Streep .\n\nLeftwingers think this level of loyalty is bizarre, especially when it comes to politicians they believe do not deserve it. Leftwingers are generally less likely to express loyalty to leaders, and more likely to pledge themselves to issue campaigns that bubble up from extra-party institutions, such as labour unions or racial justice and environmental groups. They respond to liberal attacks of \"Why aren't you knocking on doors in the general election?\" with \"Why aren't you joining the Fight for $15 ?\" (a national grassroots campaign for fairer wages led by fast-food workers). Leftwingers believe liberals cannot think for themselves on issues - that they wait to get the go-ahead from the party establishment before they offer any support. To leftwingers, the liberals' shorter-term issues, such as the Russia investigation , are just distractions unless they are embedded in more fundamental issue campaigns.\n\nEstablishment Democrats often see leftwingers' enthusiasm for disjointed issue campaigns over the party platform as further evidence that they do not understand \"how real politics works\". As Slate writer Stephen Metcalf describes: \"I see a social movement left that protests then goes home; and a Democratic party that stays on and does the hard, boring work.\" Loyal Democrats see their friends forming phone-banks to urge members of Congress to oppose Republican attacks on Obamacare, and wonder why there are not more leftwingers pitching in. To loyal Democrats, either you call yourself a Democrat, be a team player and move issues forward as part of a concerted, directed party strategy ... or you believe in the power of, to use one common liberal phrase, \"Bernie's magic elves\", who will mysteriously and effortlessly accomplish all the hidden work that it takes to make policy goals a reality.\n\nLeftwingers, on the other hand, believe liberals have delusions of their own: namely that party politicians will naturally push important issues forward without any prodding. Party loyalists, they believe, fail to see that without popular agitation, party priorities are set by powerful interests. Leftwingers, they insist, are team players, but their teams are outside groups and issues, and they put in the work earlier in the policy process than establishment Democrats.\n\nThis divide over party loyalty played out earlier this year in a skirmish over Jon Ossoff's candidacy in a special congressional election in Georgia. Ossoff did not come out strongly for any issues that weren't dictated by party leadership, but he was a loyal Democrat and would have been a reliable Democratic vote in Congress. His campaign was powered in large part by teams of suburban Atlanta moms - grassroots party loyalists who earnestly cared about resisting Trump. Liberals poured passion into the campaign while leftwingers criticised his bland message. When Ossoff lost, many loyalists viewed it as another example of the left not getting on board for a critical team project. Leftwingers, meanwhile, saw it as evidence that the party was still failing to understand the issues that really mattered to voters.\n\nThe divide over what we are trying to win is coupled with a divide over how we win. The first part of this strategic divide is over what policies a losing party should adopt to win back power. Liberals' go-to strategy is often thus: if you are losing, tack your policies to the centre to win; once you win back power, you can enact what you want.\n\nLiberals believe that the left too often chooses ideological purity over victory. They think leftwingers are not serious about power: if populist leaders, they argue, ever had to actually lead the party - if they had to win elections and pass legislation - they too would be forced to be more pragmatic. Many establishment Democrats buy into the Republican talking point that the US is a centre-right country, and that Democrats need to adjust their strategy to that reality.\n\nLeftwingers have the inverse policy strategy: if you are losing, you need a more differentiated, passionate policy vision to win. The writer Adam Johnson points to how Jeremy Corbyn succeeded with this strategy: \"Corbyn's campaign caught fire because he offered a clear moral vision of justice ... they call it 'ideology' ... But ideology is simply pragmatism over a longer timetable.\"\n\nLeftwingers like Johnson believe liberals have been conned by the right into playing on their rhetorical turf. When Democrats couch their proposals in Republican rhetoric - such as when they refer to Russian interference as \"communist infiltration\" or pitch social welfare programs as \"helping entrepreneurs\" - they, in the left's mind, commit the double error of appearing like inauthentic Diet Republicans and diluting the power of the Democrats' own potentially inspiring ideals. At their most sceptical, leftwingers wonder whether Democratic leaders are tacking to the centre not simply as an electoral strategy, but because they do not believe in leftwing ideas in the first place. These leftwingers point to examples of times when Democrats had power and still did not advance their stated ideals in what leftwingers considered to be a sufficiently ambitious manner.\n\nIn short, the party's liberal wing believes winning leads to idealism, whereas the party's left wing believes idealism leads to winning.\n\nPerhaps the root of these first two divides is a third divide: how much difference leftwingers and liberals believe there is between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nParty loyalists believe the gap between the two parties is huge. The Republican party is so egregiously horrible, they argue, that it is imperative to remain loyal to our only hope of stopping them: the Democratic party. This viewpoint is captured in a recent Democratic Campaign Coordinating Committee sign reading \"Democrats 2018: I mean, have you seen the other guys?\" This belief explains why liberals tend to focus on the outrages of the \"other guys\" and downplay the left-liberal divide: given the constant threat of Republican power, any internal differences are minuscule. What's more, the threat of Republican power, liberals point out, is especially acute to marginalised communities: whereas privileged idealists can afford to say \"it has to get worse before it gets better,\" immigrants at risk of deportation, black people at risk of police brutality and gay couples at risk of having their rights rolled back do not have the same luxury.\n\nLeftwingers, on the other hand, see the gap between Democrats and Republicans as smaller. They like to point out examples of silent bipartisanship: the complicity of Democrats in the disastrous war in Iraq and the racist war on drugs , for example, or the Obama administration's continuation of Bush-era, corporate-driven education reform. They criticise party loyalists for letting Democratic leaders steer them towards formerly Republican positions, such as when some Democratic loyalists began criticising administration leakers such as Chelsea Manning - a figure they would have lionised if she had committed her leaks while Bush was president.\n\nBehind this divide is a failure to see eye-to-eye over certain larger narratives - narratives that leftwingers talk about more than liberals do. The left often situates both parties within broader conceptual frameworks, such as neoliberalism, corporate power and imperialism. To defeat these larger, nefarious societal structures and historical trends, leftwingers argue, we must identify them and prepare a plan to conquer them - a task more difficult than just defeating the Republicans at the ballot box.\n\nMany liberals, meanwhile, either have not thought about, do not believe in, or do not prioritise addressing these forces. Some have even made fun of leftwingers for talking too much about \" neoliberalism \" - a phrase many centrists believe has no meaning, but that leftwingers insist is analytically useful. (Ironically, this is the same dynamic at play as when conservatives snarkily dismiss phrases such as \"white supremacy\" and \"patriarchy\" as being meaningless, despite the insistence by both leftists and liberals that you could fill an entire library with books explaining each phrase's depth of meaning.)\n\nThese divisions may have started the left-liberal conflict, but it has been sustained by the fact that both sides are developing into integrated political tribes. As social psychologist Jonathan Haidt argues , political tribalism begins with shared intuitions: we first feel what is politically right, then later muster arguments to support our intuitions. When people who share some intuitions about politics find each other and discover they share other intuitions, they begin to form political communities to collaborate on mustering arguments for their bundles of shared intuitions. Out of these political communities emerge leaders and institutions. The tribal formation is complete when these communities establish a unified tribal narrative - complete with stories of the past, present and future; heroes and villains; and direction for what members should be doing.\n\nToday's left wing of the party emerged as a bundle of intuitions about the Democratic establishment: scepticism of the Clintons; concern about the Obama administration's response to the financial crisis and wars in the Middle East; and curiosity as to why working-class issues have been less trumpeted by the party in recent decades than they might have been in the past. In recent years, leaders and institutions emerged to articulate these intuitions: media ventures such as Jacobin , the Intercept and Chapo Trap House; politicians such as Keith Ellison, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders; and organisations fighting for causes such as a $15 minimum wage, Medicare for All and a ban on fracking. A narrative has coalesced of a party that has been corrupted by corporate campaign donations; that is complicit in conservatism's rise, through its capitulation to Reaganomics and Bush-era militarism; that has displaced its working-class base to make room for a professional, managerial class; and, most damningly, has replaced its democracy-enhancing New Deal ambitions with a minimalist grab-bag of meritocracy-enhancing, technocratic band-aids.\n\nThe loyalist wing of the party has had a tribe-building process, too - one likely accelerated by the party rebels' rise. They started out with a different bundle of political intuitions: more trust for leaders like Obama and Clinton; more credit given to what Democrats were able to accomplish in the age of conservative ascendance; more inspiration taken from the racial and gender diversity of party leadership; and more appreciation for the progressive causes the party has begun to articulate over the past decades. A network of party-friendly institutions, journalists and leaders, old and new, has emerged to articulate and defend these liberal intuitions: media entities such as MSNBC and Slate; the DNC itself; the leaders and staffers of the Obama administration and Clinton campaigns; mainstream liberal thinktanks; and writers such as the economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman , and Clara Jeffery, editor of Mother Jones magazine. A narrative has emerged to unify this wing as well: a story that casts the Democratic party as the entity that has overcome unprecedented Republican attacks to give voice to and fight for the interests of marginalised people in American politics.\n\nThese political tribes build a network of trust between their individual members and the complexities of national politics. As individuals, we cannot know everything about national politics, but we can collect trustworthy people who do know about different areas of politics. Take Elizabeth Warren, for example: leftwingers believe she shares their deep politics regarding Wall Street, so they look to her when they want to know, say, if a recent regulation is effective or toothless. Or take Barack Obama's foreign policy: many liberals are less critical of it than leftwingers are, because they trust that Obama is similar, deep down, to them, and therefore believe his decisions would be similar to the decisions they would make if they were privy to his information. Trust explains why each side is preoccupied with showing how different surface-level moves by national figures are windows into some alien - or familiar - deep politics: it validates their trust or distrust in each side's establishment or counter-establishment.\n\nThese political tribes have their benefits. They help draw people into politics, bring people together and give members purpose. But political tribalism can also be hazardous. At its worst, it creates enemies out of neighbours, turning complex people into \"sell-outs\" or \"purists\". Tribes trick us into thinking that political participation is about being well-versed in tribal rhetoric - say, being able to list the correct takes on past inter-tribal skirmishes - rather than about pursuing tangible goals. They encourage confirmatory, self-validating thought, rather than the exploratory thought that helps our politics stay aligned with reality. The focus that comes with tribalism can lapse into myopia, such as when some liberals can see Trump's wickedness regarding immigration so clearly, but were unable to support immigration activists protesting Obama; or when some leftwingers can see the corporate corruption of Democrats so clearly, but fail to articulate the massive gap in corruption between the two parties.\n\nA final danger of political tribalism - one specific to the intra-party divide - is that it is a danger to the coalition-building required to gain power through electoral politics. If a party coalition is divided against itself come election day, it may not stand. And if the coalition loses, both tribes lose. And with each passing of month of Trump's presidency, the stakes get higher.\n\nSo, who is right? Fortunately, a peace process need not declare one side's narrative as supreme. However, it does require each side to come to terms, at least a bit, with the best insights of the other side.\n\nThe liberals' best insight is that today's Republican party is an exceptionally dangerous political organisation. It denies catastrophic climate change , is an almost-pure vessel for the corporate takeover of public power , has based its electoral coalition on aligning with white ethnic nationalism and authoritarian theocracy, and has instigated disastrous decision after disastrous decision over the past decades.\n\nDemocratic party leaders over the past decades may have been cowardly in the face of Republican cruelty but they were, for the most part, not the instigators of the most callous developments in modern American politics. Winning general elections against the Republican party matters - and putting in the work to defeat them at the ballot box is a responsibility of all progressives.\n\nThe leftwingers' best insight is that the end-goal of electoral politics is not winning; it is the advancement of certain programmes and policies. As anyone who has watched the conservative ascendancy within the Republican party knows, internal criticism of party leaders is what makes leaders listen. As Frederick Douglass said: \"Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.\"\n\nA productive peace process for the intraparty war would merge these insights, advancing a practice that would help defeat the Republican party while keeping Democratic leaders on their toes. You could call this practice \"vigorous critical loyalty\". Vigorous critical loyalty would work by separating the times for vigorous party loyalty and the times for vigorous internal criticism. A Democrat practising vigorous critical loyalty would, near the general election or a critical vote in Congress, demonstrate vigorous loyalty to the party, mustering support for the Democratic candidate or bill while holding criticism for later. But during a primary campaign, and during ordinary legislative time, a vigorous critical loyalist would fight vigorously for her ideals, unafraid of criticising party leaders, supporting primary challengers, and advancing outside issue campaigns.\n\nFor this to work, both sides need to give a little. Liberals need to accept that primary challenges to beloved party leaders are not only legitimate, but desirable, in order to keep the party aligned with its people. Liberals also need to accept that outside issue campaigns are legitimate. If an important issue - such as immigrant rights and universal health care - is having a difficult time breaking through to the party, interrupting speeches and writing harsh critiques of party stars becomes necessary. Liberals should balance their loyalty to party figures with respect for this difficult, messy and effective work of pushing peripheral issues on to the national stage.\n\nLeftwingers, on the other hand, first need to bring their passion into mainstream party projects - especially general election campaigns. They should supplement their respect for the ideological activists pushing important issues into the mainstream with respect for the loyal, grassroots Democrats who make sure there are enough Democratic votes in Congress to make any policy matter. If leftwingers are asking liberals to respect the distinction between leftwingers and liberals, they should return the favour by respecting the distinction between liberals and their Republican adversaries - and act on that distinction by taking seriously the role the Democratic party has played as a bulwark against the extremes of Republican power.\n\nSecond, leftwingers need to understand that the way to gain the respect of the other half of the party is to not just say they \"would have won\", but rather to actually win. The biggest problem with the Sanders campaign is the same problem that the Clinton campaign had: it lost. In turn, the biggest asset of the Sanders campaign is that it almost won. Obama was able to change the party because he won. The Fight for $15 was able to change the party because it has won in cities and states across the country. A rebellious vision gains followers when it shows it can win.\n\nIn sum, an ideal Democratic party would arbitrate internal divides through a flurry of vigorous issue campaigns and primary challenges during ordinary time and then, during general election time and critical Congressional votes, rapidly unify to win.\n\nThis would move our conflicts away from neverending shadow-boxing and toward resolution in the court of public opinion. Primaries, for example, will help resolve the strategy divide, by showing whether \"pragmatism\" or \"idealism\" wins in general elections, as candidates of different persuasions win primaries and test their pragmatist/idealist orientation in general elections. Issue campaigns, meanwhile, will show the extent to which the party has been corrupted by nefarious structural forces. One need not endlessly discuss whether this or that politician is a \"neoliberal shill\" if you can resolve the question by launching issue campaigns that dramatise these larger forces at play and see whether said politician supports the campaign. If they do, they may be worthy of more trust. If they do not, they may be worthy of a primary challenge.\n\nAnd finally, by agreeing from the start that everyone, no matter their level of criticism during ordinary time, is fully on board to support the party when general election time comes, concerns about party loyalty are reduced. All intraparty fights are tolerated - and even encouraged - because everyone can trust that we will be unified when it counts.\n\nVigorous critical loyalty presumes that people can change, and that there is a potential to re-integrate the left and liberal tribes. As issue campaigns gain support from current party leaders and improbable primary challengers become party leaders, party sceptics become more loyal, while party loyalists start showing loyalty to leaders and issues formerly seen as heretical.\n\nMost importantly, vigorous critical loyalty could help rebuild trust. Primary challengers that win become closer to the people they represent. To have an issue emerge from a trusted outside group and then have that issue enter the mainstream of the party is to build loyalists' trust in that outside group while building populists' trust in the party.\n\nThis is how two tribes could eventually merge into one without either side compromising on their ideals and loyalties. It may seem like a longshot. But I take hope from a point that Washington Post assistant editor Elizabeth Bruenig raised at a talk earlier this year: \"You don't argue with people who are nothing like you ... you argue with people who are almost like you ... [Arguing] is a pretty good sign of the possibility of coalition.\"\n\nA longer version of this article first appeared in Current Affairs , a bimonthly print magazine of culture and politics.\n\nFollow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread , or sign up to the long read weekly email here ."

      "text": "The Latin American left is smart not to pick a side over Venezuela's contested election result\n\nAttempts to get Nicolás Maduro back to the negotiating table highlight the influence of a younger generation of voters\n\nW hen Nicolás Maduro was declared the winner of the Venezuelan presidential election last week, there was an immediate outcry and accusations of fraud . Maduro had trailed significantly in many polls, and the National Electoral Council (CNE) didn't provide access to voting breakdowns as it is legally required to do.\n\nWhile much of the rhetoric from Maduro and opposition candidate Edmundo González Urrutia's supporters has been heated, left-leaning governments in the region haven't come down on either side - despite many longstanding connections with Maduro's administration. This marked shift within the remnants of the \"pink tide\" of leftist governments that dominated Latin American countries in the 00s may provide a way through the crisis, and achieve a democratic transition in Venezuela .\n\nThe governments of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico have led many other nations in demanding electoral authorities release voting tallies for each electronic voting machine, but they have abstained from accusing Maduro of wrongdoing - they have not used the term \"fraud\" or denounced the Venezuelan regime's unacceptable post-election human rights violations . They are apparently hoping to get Venezuela's government and opposition parties back to the negotiating table.\n\nThis is perhaps the most high-profile example of the mediating role Brazil's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, seeks on the world stage, and a demonstration of what his \"active nonalignment\" diplomacy looks like in practice.\n\nIf Lula's strategy - taken on by the larger bloc - works, it will be a resounding affirmation of his much-misunderstood \"third way\" diplomatic strategy , which seeks to further the economic concerns of developing countries without picking a side in the great powers conflict in the current global cold war 2.0. It will also be a moral compass in a region where democracy is threatened by backsliding driven by elected leaders. The strategy could serve as an important electoral bulwark against the rise of extreme-right movements that threaten Latin American democracy.\n\nThis studiedly unhostile approach to Venezuela's crisis represents an alternative to the dominant approach of the past: with Latin American countries denouncing whichever side was ideologically convenient and the US bluntly deploying economic sanctions. While the Biden administration has strongly supported negotiation efforts in Venezuala, Washington unilaterally recognised the opposition candidate González as the winner of the election on Thursday.\n\nThis kind of posturing has done little, and unreserved support from western states has often provided cover for governments to make authoritarian moves. Additionally, in a multipolar world where Venezuela can rely on the support of Russia and China - both of which have already congratulated Maduro on his re-election - it risks pulling the region into larger international conflicts.\n\nLeftists in the region have traditionally maintained a soft spot for Cuba, and have, for years, refrained from fully denouncing democratic backsliding in Venezuela. This tolerance reflects a cold war-influenced bilateral tradition in the region that has always tried, wrongly, to differentiate between leftwing and rightwing authoritarianism, allowing that violations committed in the name of an ideology could somehow be justified in the face of the larger battle between the two sides. The stance must be understood against the backdrop of cynical US intervention in Latin America that long supported violent military dictatorships.\n\nStatements this week by Lula , Colombia's president, Gustavo Petro , Mexico's president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador , Mexico's president-elect, Claudia Sheinbaum , Chile's president, Gabriel Boric , former Chilean president Michelle Bachelet and former Argentinian president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner are the most visible sign of a deep shift in the Latin American left, away from these ideological commitments.\n\nTo have even former fellow travellers, such as Lula and Kirchner, push back against Maduro's election fraud lays bare the increasing gap between Latin America's leftist democracies and \"leftist\" dictatorships. The old leaders' new stance partially responds to generational turnover . Today's young voters were raised in the pink tide period and didn't live through the social devastation wreaked by Washington consensus neoliberal economic policies. In Chile, Colombia and Brazil, they have elected leaders whose platforms focused on climate crisis, social justice and reproductive health.\n\nThe leftist leaders' statements also hint at a manifesto for Latin America's new left, with democracy and social justice as cornerstones, framed as historical continuity. Indeed, Petro and Kirchner invoked the legacy of Hugo Chávez in calling for Maduro to publish detailed election results. They also emphasised the deleterious effect of US sanctions on Venezuelan democracy. The decades-long US embargo on Cuba is detested by the region's left, and the reference marks a ratification of their historical anti-imperialist stance.\n\nThe region's rightwing leaders have rightly highlighted the crimes against humanity committed by Maduro. But few expressed the same concern for human rights abuses committed by ideological allies, such as the massacre of protesters under the interim government of Jeanine Áñez in Bolivia in 2019, or the electoral fraud that Juan Orlando Hernández leveraged into a second presidential term in Honduras in 2017. Argentina's president, Javier Milei, has called Maduro a \" communist dictator \", but has cozied up to El Salvador , apparently unconcerned by the systematic human rights violations that form the backbone of President Nayib Bukele's controversial security policies. Thus, their outrage will carry little weight in this crisis.\n\nLeftist leaders' new stance represents a moral line that is consistent with the ideology they profess; how they respond to increasing government repression will be a test of this shift. In any case, the goal of bringing about a true accounting of the election results cannot be accomplished without engaging Maduro's government.\n\nJordana Timerman is a journalist based in Buenos Aires"

      "text": "Leftists and \"the lesser of two evils\"\n\nWriter, leftist, law grad, news junkie and compulsive blogger\n\nOne aspect which is central to the essence of being a leftist is this pressure, particularly from liberals, to constantly choose from \"the lesser of two evils\". They tell us each election that rather than stick to a set of principles, allow your principles bow to pragmatism, always. And, pragmatism means voting for the lesser of two evils. Always.\n\nThough, what shocks me is that people are surprised that those who have consistently voted democratically, with the pipe dream of improving their state of marginalization, are still upset , despite something as seemingly inevitable as Sanders conceding the democratic nomination to Hillary Clinton.\n\nPundits at the DNC, as I write this, continue to follow suit in mentioning that Sanders seems to have \"lost control over his delegation\". What they fail to recognize is that whatever control Sanders may have had over \"his delegation\" was based on an idea, on a radical, hopeful idea, that change was - it is possible. Bernie Sanders represented something, and that something transcends Bernie Sanders, the candidate. That's more than a vast majority of politicians can say. The notion that individuals could rally as a people and have a voice which could be heard above the racket of politicking - that an accumulation of wealth could not stymie our agenda against our accumulation of voices - this idea does not simply cease to exist in the psyches of the disenfranchised.\n\n\"Radical\" and \"revolution\" are the terms Cillizza uses to make us The Others, to make the establishment more palatable and less scary . And, the truth is, I'd say most leftists are sick as fuck with voting for the \"lesser of two evils\". It is not an evil to have \"lost control\" over a revolution you've been attributed with beginning; its an indication of true social unrest which exists independently of you. Sanders did not create a social unrest with his campaign, he highlighted the existence of one which had been ignored, time and time again, as being politically too scattered to matter. Young people and poor people are those to whom you pay lip service to in American politics: one does not actually serve them. American politics serves the interests of those who control the means of production. They nearly always have.\n\nWe want to be truly represented, for once. We don't want to vote for the lesser of two evils. We are mad that the DNC was stacked against our candidate. We are mad that our environment continues to be ravaged, and our futures put in peril. We are mad that we have been fed a myth about a meritocracy which does not exist. We want justice, we want greed reigned in - not further enabled. We want our representatives to truly represent us.\n\nIt seems unfathomable to me that the democratic establishment could be as genuinely surprised as they seem to be at this moment, that when a candidate managed to break free from the bonds of capitalist interests and unite a marginalized people, that those people would be susceptible to continuing to mobilize that unified voice.\n\nWe want to be heard, and, in my opinion, what you should be hearing from \"Sanders'\" notably unruly delegation is that: \"we are sick of voting for the lesser of two evils\".\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Why Leftists And Liberals Need To Engage With Religion Instead Of Dismissing It\n\nAssistant Professor of Political Science and History at Ashoka University\n\nSome time ago I was sitting with a senior member of the Communist Party of India who insisted on telling the gathering that 1400- and 2500-year-old books had no relevance in today's world. The books they were referring to were the Gita and the Quran. I countered that although a mere toddler in comparison, The Communist Manifesto amongst Baba Marx's other writings, was also a product of a particular socio-economic and political era in European history. Despite this, I added, they and many others of their \" biraadari \" (community) continue to proselytise and spread the Communist gospel. Now you can imagine the reaction of the venerable comrade when the words, \" biraadari ,\" \"proselytisation\" and \"gospel\" were used to describe the movement that they were a part of. The outrage, of course, was natural because just like any ideological system, communism and various forms of socialism also presume that their worldview is the most advanced, scientifically correct and therefore the most rational. In a different sense this is also the conceit of liberalism.\n\n[Leftists' and liberals'] philosophical worldview is largely deracinated and, therefore, bereft of any meaningful connections to the lived experiences and ground realities of a place like India.\n\nQuite apart from the fact that liberalism developed at a time in European history when imperial conquest and later colonialism were expanding, one important feature of classic liberal thought was that it assumed itself to be the natural outcome of the triumph of reason in post-enlightenment Europe. Liberals thinkers like Mill and Hume found ways to dismiss those who were perceived to be have not progressed or who were deemed scientifically backward by labelling them as childish or uncivilised. This discourse about perceived backwardness and supposed scientific advancement being the ultimate measure of progress travelled with the empire to various parts of the world. In doing so it imparted and implanted a belief amongst people who were colonised that their inherently weak and irrational systems were responsible for their defeat.\n\nReligion and religious thought were perceived to be necessarily backward and regressive and therefore any identity that predicated itself on religion was naturally deemed to be not worthy of consideration. Of course, as long as the empire and the social elites that were generated by it survived, liberal thought defined post-colonial politics in Indian and in many other parts of the world. Amongst other thing, this led to deep-seated insecurities amongst religious groups and therefore they sought to reorient and reconfigure themselves according to the critiques preferred by colonising elites. Indeed, this is how religious reform movements amongst both Hindus and Muslims in the 19 century are so inextricably linked to the rise of today's religious politics in India, and indeed across the world, with all its attendant anxieties. In fact this anxiety or insecurity about not being \"modern enough\" has led to some of the most violent religious reform movements across the colonised world: from Salafism in parts of the Muslim world to Hindu nationalism in India.\n\nThe poverty... of both liberal and leftist discourse has been that they have both failed to take into account that people's religious identities might very well be the primary identity through which they participate in politics.\n\nThe defining feature of liberal as well as of various strands of leftist thought was that religious identity was something that should be restricted, if need be, to the private sphere and should be emphatically kept away from the public sphere. The reason for this was that both these ideological systems saw themselves as normative lodestars. In other words, both these schools of thought saw themselves as \"natural\" culminations of human thought that therefore represented the most progressive, scientific and rational way of ordering society. Of course, the small matter that both these ideological systems emerged from centuries of internal change and conflict within Europe was completely overlooked when transplanting them to other parts of the world. The reform of the Church, the rise of a public sphere and therefore the emergence of various \"publics\" in addition to the \"scientific revolution\" were all processes that took centuries in Europe.\n\nIt was inevitable that both liberalism and various forms of communism and socialism would inevitably be elite discourses in post-colonial countries and in societies that had not organically incubated change. In post-independence India, for the vast majority of the people who had hitherto been at the service of landed elites, the only identity they could embrace fully was their religious identity. In other words, these ideological systems sought to impose their worldview on populations that had not gone through the structural changes that were required to truly benefit from them. The poverty and indeed the undoing, to a certain extent, of both liberal and leftist discourse has been that they have both failed to take into account that people's religious identities might very well be the primary identity through which they participate in politics.\n\nThe debates around free speech... would perhaps become more constructive if the liberals and the left were able to move beyond the assumption that they occupy some kind of higher moral ground.\n\nIn a country like India, this has meant that the language and vocabulary deployed by liberals and leftists has deliberately not engaged with religious ideas and symbols in a society, which by all accounts is increasingly religious. Thus, in matters of ghar wapsi , love jihad and anti-Romeo squads, the volume of temple or mosque loudspeakers, meat bans and cow slaughter, graveyard walls and solar lights in mosques, the position of the liberal or leftist has been one of an arbitrator and not as someone who engages with and speaks the same vocabulary. Why cannot these groups redefine Hindutva rather than simply rejecting it? Perhaps because to a large extent their philosophical worldview is largely deracinated and, therefore, bereft of any meaningful connections to the lived experiences and ground realities of a place like India.\n\nThis willful neglect has led to the fact that religion, religious discourse and therefore religious identity has become the preserve of those who seek to use this crucial aspect of people's identity to assert their own power. By the arrogant assumption that religion has no place in political life, liberals and the left have created an almost unbridgeable gulf not only between themselves and a substantial part of the population but also between those political parties that have understood the primary importance of religion in people's lives.\n\nOf course, religion and nationalism also make good bedfellows. This is yet another crucial aspect that has not been sufficiently taken into account when trying to understand societies that view their relationship with the state through the lens of religion and various identities derived from religion, such as caste. If one's primary identity is a religious identity then how is nationalism recast to fit this? In India it is this potent mix of nationalism, religion and development brewed on the fires of deep-seated insecurities that has lead to a situation in which leading politicians can openly call for the killing of Muslims.\n\nBy not engaging with religious thought, the liberals and the left have ceded ground to those who are then able to co-opt religious identity to suit their goals.\n\nFor a person whose universe is defined by their social and religious community, the liberal idea of universal and inalienable rights will be much more unfamiliar than the person who invokes and speaks to their communitarian religious identity. Similarly, the leftist who speaks of social justice and equality will be unable to make headway in a society where hierarchies have not only survived for millennia but which have not gone through the necessary structural, social and economic changes that would enable people to understand their message. The point is not that liberalism and leftist thought do not have meaningful and indeed very valid ideas for the creation of a fairer and more just society but rather it is that these traditions need to be located within and derived from religious traditions in order to make them salient for populations whose worldview is predominantly formed by their religious identity.\n\nThe debates around free speech in the various campuses of Delhi would perhaps become a bit more constructive if the liberals and the left were able to move beyond the assumption that they occupy some kind of higher moral ground and start engaging with the ground realities of the societies they seem to engage with. Similarly, the opposition, or whatever remains of it today, needs to introspect about what their broader ideology is beyond the empty concepts of secularism, caste-based politics and development. By not engaging with religious thought, the liberals and the left have ceded ground to those who are then able to co-opt religious identity to suit their goals. It is precisely the lack of a clear, inclusive and binding ideology that has led to their decimation."

      "text": "5 Things Leftists Should Know About Bernie Sanders\n\nWriter, trade unionist and community organizer from Burlington, Vermont\n\nThe Bernie Sanders campaign has provoked widespread interest and debate on the U.S. Left, such as it is. This post is a contribution to that debate from the perspective of a left organizer who has been active in trade union and community organizing in Sanders' home state of Vermont for the better part of two decades.\n\nThis post is not directed at progressives, but at leftists -- those who identify as socialists communists and/or anarchists, those who want to replace capitalism with a different system , not simply reign in its most atrocious features. In short, those whose vision of liberation goes far beyond what Sanders has articulated in his political program.\n\nThe purpose of this post is not to convince individuals to vote for or against Sanders, or to give money or time to his campaign. Rather, the purpose is to help leftists assess how the Sanders campaign impacts our strategies (or attempts to formulate strategies) to build a social force that is strong enough to dismantle and replace capitalism.\n\nThe summer that I moved to Vermont, before I acquired gainful employment, I went out canvassing for Sanders a couple of times -- he was still in Congress, and still had to run for re-election every two years. Of the maybe twenty people I spoke to, two of them had been personally helped by Sanders' office when he was mayor of Burlington. And one told me that he didn't agree with Sanders on a single issue, but always voted for him, because Sanders was always honest about what he believed.\n\nThis is not to argue that Sanders is uniquely principled in his politics -- clearly he will give in to pressure in some situations. In 2000, in the wake of Vermont's at-the-time groundbreaking Civil Union law for same-sex couples, Sanders was the last statewide politician to make a statement on it (though his positions have evolved ). However he is, in my experience, uniquely committed to using his position to serve the interests of the people.\n\nUntil recently, he lived in a modest split-level in Burlington (and his new house is not much bigger), and he displays no interest in trading on his position to achieve personal gain. While he has been criticized for being tough on employees, as a former staffer says, \"He is a very hard worker himself. I mean, he is at it 24-7 -- and that's really no exaggeration. He works really, really hard, and he expects the people who work for him to work really, really hard.\"\n\nPerhaps the clearest example of this is how willing he is to take on the most powerful corporations in the world . It is hard to think of another politician who would be willing to anger General Electric while running for president.\n\nMany of us on the Left are skeptical of, or at least highly aware of the limitations of, what we often refer to as \"bourgeois democracy\" -- voting for one or another candidate to manage the capitalist state. This skepticism is mirrored in the attitude of many liberal politicians (such as President Obama), who may genuinely want to use the political process such as it is to improve people's lives, but who accept that they must operate only in the narrow constraints of what powerful institutions deem \"politically possible.\"\n\nSanders, for better or for worse, genuinely believes that the institutions of American democracy can be used to bring about deep, structural political changes that will improve the lives of millions of people in real ways. And this belief leads him to attempt things that most of us on the Left think impossible -- such as running for president as a socialist.\n\nUnlike most Democratic Party politicians, who will only support trade union and social movement struggles when asked or pressured to, and only after making political calculations, Sanders takes an active interest in the organizational health of the trade union movement and other popular organizations.\n\nFor several years I served as the highest-ranking elected official of the United Electrical Workers union (UE) in Vermont. As such -- since we are independent of the AFL-CIO -- I was regularly invited to meet with Sanders, along with the presidents of the AFL-CIO, Vermont NEA (teachers' union), and the independent Vermont State Employees Association. Sanders, in effect, convened the trade union movement in a way that its official representatives were too short-sighted or fragmented to do on our own. He has sponsored labor conferences that bring together hundreds of union members to discuss the political issues of the day and promote a working-class political vision. The first of these that I attended was led by labor leftist Bill Fletcher , in 1999, as Fletcher was being eased out of the AFL-CIO for his radicalism.\n\nIn addition to convening trade unionists, Sanders has been instrumental in supporting, and on occasion leading, countless workers' struggles in Vermont. His support was crucial to the nearly 2000 nurses at the state's largest hospital winning union recognition , and to hundreds of federal contract workers winning millions in back pay after being systematically underpaid in violation of the federal Service Contract Act. In 2000, when IBM initiated drastic changes to its pension plan, Sanders essentially served as shop-steward-at-large for the thousands of workers at IBM's non-union plant in Vermont (and, indeed, for IBM workers nationally), helping to win significant modifications to the draconian take-backs.\n\nSanders has done similar organizational work with the environmental and women's movements, among others. Most strikingly, he has invited the Vermont Workers' Center to directly recruit at his campaign events. Unlike the vast majority of politicians, even those on the left, Sanders does not see non-electoral organizing as in competition with electoral strategies, but as a crucial complement to them.\n\nIn his Atlantic piece, \" Why Precisely Is Bernie Sanders Against Reparations? \" Ta-Nehisi Coates argues that \"Sometimes the moral course lies within the politically possible, and sometimes the moral course lies outside of the politically possible. One of the great functions of radical candidates is to war against equivocators and opportunists who conflate these two things. Radicals expand the political imagination and, hopefully, prevent incrementalism from becoming a virtue.\"\n\nWhile true, I think this represents a fundamental misreading of Sanders. He does not see himself as a radical candidate. He is not a Ralph Nader or a Jill Stein. He is not so much interested in expanding the political imagination as in winning actual changes in the way society is governed.\n\nWhile Sanders' statement on reparations having no chance of passage was, like many things he says about race, tone-deaf, it was not wrong. Coates asserts that Sanders' single-payer proposal is equally unlikely to pass Congress -- but there is a significant difference: single-payer has widespread public support, in a way that reparations do not.\n\nThis is not to say that those of us who believe in reparations should not criticize Sanders, only that we have a job to do -- convincing more white folks (and more non-Black people of color, and to be honest more Black folks as well) that reparations is not only the right thing to do, but in our long-term interests. And, for better or for worse, we need to be realistic that Sanders is not going to do that job for us.\n\nThe bottom line is: Sanders would not be running if he did not honestly believe that he has a chance of winning, and that he would be able to -- over time -- pass significant parts of his agenda. He has won elections for over three decades, has experience governing, and has more than two and a half decades' experience moving both small and large agendas through Congress. While we may not agree with every decision he has made, is making, or will make, we need to understand that fundamentally what he is doing is looking for the most achievable radical change, and the most radical achievable change (within his own political framework of social democracy).\n\nWhile this is, understandably, not part of the Sanders campaign's public history, when Bernie was first elected mayor of Burlington in 1981, he was faced with an extremely hostile city council -- having only two allies out of 14 city councillors. Burlington's city government is run on a commission system, meaning the mayor's power is significantly checked by commissions, appointed by the city council, who oversee almost all city departments. When Sanders was first elected, Burlington was in many ways a traditional Democratic Party one-party machine fiefdom -- and the machine wasn't about to let some upstart \"socialist\" actually run the city.\n\nIn response, Bernie and his supporters took the one small city department the mayor had direct control over, the office of economic development, renamed it the \"Community and Economic Development Office,\" and began to use it to facilitate organization and mobilization in the city's neighborhoods. Most significantly, they established \"Neighborhood Planning Assemblies\" in each of the city's seven wards. The assemblies met monthly, and CEDO turned over a certain portion of the federal block grants that they administered to the assemblies to fund neighborhood improvements (not unlike the \" Participatory Budgeting \" that the Brazilian Workers' Party would establish in Porto Alegre later in the decade). This institution continues to this day, and has provided a crucial space for popular mobilization on issues both local -- such as fighting proposed closings of schools in working-class neighborhoods -- and national and international -- such as pressing the city council to take progressive stands against the war in Iraq, or for immigrants' rights.\n\nIn addition to the NPAs, Sanders and his allies established a women's council, an arts council, a sister city program with Puerto Cabezas in Sandanista Nicaragua, and a robust community-access television network. The Clerk's office and the Board for Registration of Voters made it easier to register to vote and easier to vote. Over time, popular involvement in these progressive, participatory initiatives sponsored and supported by the mayor's office led to political change. More Sanders allies were elected to the City Council under the banner of the loose \"Progressive Coalition\" (which eventually formally formed the statewide Vermont Progressive Party in the late 1990s), as were more independents and Republicans , breaking the Democratic party machine stranglehold on city government. Eventually, even Democrats on the council began to see the light and work with Sanders .\n\nThis track record is an important counterpoint to those who argue that Sanders, if elected, would be unable to move his agenda through a Congress dominated by Republicans and conservative Democrats. And it is also important to think about how, if he is elected, leftists and popular organizations can make use of such openings that a Sanders presidency would provide.\n\n* * *\n\nAs stated above, I am not writing this post to argue that individual leftists should vote for or against Bernie (although I voted for him, as I always have), or give time or money to his campaign (although I have done both). Nor am I going to argue that grassroots organizations should divert limited resources from organizing into involvement in Bernie's campaign. Those decisions have to be made based on the time, place and conditions that individuals and organizations are working in.\n\nHowever, I am going to tell a cautionary tale from 1990, the year that Sanders first got elected to Congress.\n\nBennington County, in the southwest corner of Vermont, is one of the more conservative parts of the state -- in fact, it was the only county that Sanders did not carry in 1990. The Sanders campaign in Bennington was run out of the offices of UE Local 295, which represented hundreds of manufacturing workers at Bijur Lubrication. Years later, the UE staff representative who had been working with Local 295 at the time told me about the victory party, how the middle-class peace and environmental activists and working-class trade unionists looked at each other and said, \"Hey, we did this amazing thing together!\" And how she never saw that happen again, because no durable political organization was built.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Log in to hide these messages.\n\nUnlike the cities of Burlington, Montpelier and Brattleboro -- liberal enclaves which do, in fact, resemble the stereotype of Vermont held by many outside the state -- Bennington is a rural, working-class, conservative area, and one that has been hit hard by globalization and deindustrialization. Bijur Lubrication moved most of its production to Mexico and China in the 90s, and closed its doors for good in the early 2000s. It is the county that Trump won most decisively in Vermont's primary in March.\n\nOne of the notable -- though not often-enough noted by people who think of politics as a linear spectrum -- aspects of the Sanders campaign is his ability to attract \"independents.\" White working-class voters in rural states who do not identify with the Democratic Party are turning out to vote for a self-proclaimed socialist. If the issue of organizing working class white folks is important to the Left (as I would argue that it should be), then we should be looking closely at Sanders' message, and how it centers working-class experience and economic pain -- something that too often becomes secondary in the rhetoric of the Left.\n\nWe also need to be thinking about the question of what happens -- politically but more importantly organizationally -- to the millions of people excited by the Sanders campaign after the Democratic Party convention this summer when, in all likelihood, Clinton will be nominated. The Sanders campaign is unlikely to build a durable political organization -- electoral campaigns simply do not do that. Electoral campaigns are a sprint, and durable political organizations have always been built by committed activists whose vision of transforming society makes them long-distance runners. However, the Sanders campaign has reached and mobilized more working-class people, with a basic anti-corporate message and an identity as a \"socialist,\" than the Left has in decades. Perhaps we have an opportunity to find new comrades in unexpected places.\n\nThis post originally appeared on JonathanKissam.wordpress.com .\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "On Donald Trump And White Leftists Who Want To Build Bridges\n\nGuest Writer\n\nI have seen a number of posts on social media urging people on the left not to write off everyone who elected Trump as racist or misogynistic. We need to connect with some of those people, we're told, as their decisions were grounded in despair and disillusionment. I have some thoughts to share with those who would make such arguments. These thoughts come from a place of love, but please understand that I mean every word.\n\nTo me, there is no distinction between racism that is named as such, because it fits some obvious social mold, and the brand of racism practiced by those who are out for their own white selves, and simply don't care if some of us live or die, whether refugees drown at sea or for lack of safer space, or whether Black people are gunned down by police with impunity in cities around the country. I understand they have their own frustrations, but they literally do not care what happens to us. They elected a man who made his disastrous intentions towards us very clear, and I reject any argument that such an act is not a racist decision.\n\nThe problem here isn't that we need to narrow our notions of racism in order to collectively build forward. It's that we need to broaden those notions to encompass racism's varied manifestations. Only then can we address the reality that white supremacy is both institutional and structural, and only then can we effectively tear down the pillars that support it. Trump voters acted in a racist manner, without question. For Black, Indigenous and other people of color who betrayed themselves and their own, this is a matter of internalized oppression, but for white people, this is all very simple: Their choices were either the product of an actively hateful mindset, or a set of values that have nothing to do with whether or not some of us survive.\n\nPlease remember: it wasn't an entire populace that perpetrated the mass genocide of my people. The violence was dealt by some, and cosigned, either actively or passively, by many others, for the sake of their own economic and social superiority. Would we not call this racism?\n\n\"Please remember: it wasn't an entire populace that perpetrated the mass genocide of my people.\"\n\nIf you are asking us to be gentle and indulge the complexities of such thinking, in this terrible moment, you are appealing to the wrong audience. If white people listened to people of color pleading for their lives or demanding justice, we wouldn't be here. White people who want white Trump supporters to be reached and led in a different direction - which is surely possible in some instances - need to get their hands dirty (or dirtier). The language Native people like myself use, or that any oppressed people use, to describe the violent decisions Trump voters have made is not the problem.\n\nThe problem is that far too few people cared about what is about to be visited upon us, and pleading with the oppressor to care, or even demanding as much, has not gotten us where we need to go.\n\nI will continue to challenge and combat racism in my work, but I am not in a position to hold the hand of those who actively perpetuate racism in white communities, and teach them to do better. That has always been work best suited to white people (and far more dangerous for us to even attempt), and historically, white leftists haven't done nearly enough of it.\n\nSo I am asking now that when you say that we shouldn't oversimplify, that you direct your pleas for bridge building to people who aren't living on the margin's edge. We don't need to hear that right now, and shouldn't have to.\n\nCall a meeting of white allies and accomplices instead, or at least be specific about who you are arguing should be building bridges.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "French Vote Gives Leftists Most Seats Over Far Right, But Leaves Hung Parliament And Deadlock\n\nPARIS (AP) - A coalition of the French left won the most seats in high-stakes legislative elections Sunday, beating back a far-right surge but failing to win a majority. The outcome left France, a pillar of the European Union and Olympic host country, facing the stunning prospect of a hung parliament and political paralysis.\n\nThe political turmoil could rattle markets and the French economy, the EU's second-largest, and have far-ranging implications for the war in Ukraine , global diplomacy and Europe's economic stability.\n\nIn calling the election on June 9 , after the far right surged in French voting for the European Parliament, President Emmanuel Macron said turning to voters again would provide \"clarification.\"\n\nOn almost every level, that gamble appears to have backfired. According to the official results released early Monday , all three main blocs fell far short of the 289 seats needed to control the 577-seat National Assembly, the more powerful of France's two legislative chambers.\n\nThe results showed just over 180 seats for the New Popular Front leftist coalition, which placed first, ahead of Macron's centrist alliance, with more than 160 seats. Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally and its allies were restricted to third place, although their more than 140 seats were still way ahead of the party's previous best showing - 89 seats in 2022.\n\nA hung parliament is unknown territory for modern France.\n\n\"Our country is facing an unprecedented political situation and is preparing to welcome the world in a few weeks,\" said Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, who plans to offer his resignation later in the day.\n\nWith the Paris Olympics looming, Attal said he was ready to stay at his post \"as long as duty demands.\" Macron has three years remaining on his presidential term.\n\nAttal made clearer than ever his disapproval of Macron's shock decision to call the election, saying \"I didn't choose this dissolution\" of the outgoing National Assembly, where the president's centrist alliance used to be single biggest group, albeit without an absolute majority. Still, it was able to govern for two years, pulling in lawmakers from other camps to fight off efforts to bring it down.\n\nThe new legislature appears shorn of such stability. When Macron flies to Washington for a summit this week of the NATO alliance , he will leave a country with no clear idea who may be its next prime minister and facing the prospect that the president may be obliged to share power with a politician deeply opposed to his policies.\n\nStill, many rejoiced. In Paris' Stalingrad square, supporters on the left cheered and applauded as projections showing the alliance ahead flashed up on a giant screen. Cries of joy also rang out in Republique plaza in eastern Paris, with people spontaneously hugging strangers and several minutes of nonstop applause after the projections landed.\n\nMarielle Castry, a medical secretary, was on the Metro in Paris when projected results were first announced.\n\n\"Everybody had their smartphones and were waiting for the results and then everybody was overjoyed,\" said the 55-year-old. \"I had been stressed out since June 9 and the European elections. ... And now, I feel good. Relieved.\"\n\nEven before votes were cast, the election redrew France's political map. It galvanized parties on the left to put differences aside and join together in the new leftist alliance. It pledges to roll back many of Macron's headline reforms, embark on a massively costly program of public spending and take a far tougher line against Israel because of the war with Hamas.\n\nMacron described the left's coalition as \"extreme\" and warned that its economic program of many tens of billions of euros in public spending, partly financed by tax hikes for high earners and on wealth, could be ruinous for France, already criticized by EU watchdogs for its debt.\n\nYet, the New Popular Front's leaders immediately pushed Macron to give the alliance the first chance to form a government and propose a prime minister.\n\nThe most prominent of the leftist coalition's leaders, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, said it \"is ready to govern.\"\n\nWhile the National Rally took more seats than ever, the anti-immigration party with historical links to antisemitism and racism fell far short of its hopes of securing an absolute majority that would have given France its first far-right government since World War II.\n\n\"Disappointed, disappointed,\" said far-right supporter Luc Doumont, 66. \"Well, happy to see our progression, because for the past few years we've been doing better.\"\n\nAfter the party finished top of the first-round vote last weekend, its rivals worked to dash its hopes of outright victory Sunday, by strategically withdrawing candidates from many districts. That left many far-right candidates in head-to-head contests against just one opponent, making it harder for them to win.\n\nMany voters decided that keeping the far right from power was more important to them than anything else, backing its opponents in the runoff, even if they weren't from the political camp they usually support.\n\nStill, National Rally leader Le Pen, expected to make a fourth run for the French presidency in 2027, said the elections laid the groundwork for \"the victory of tomorrow.\"\n\n\"The reality is that our victory is only deferred,\" she added. But Le Pen's older sister, Marie-Caroline, was among her party's losers Sunday, defeated by a leftist candidate and just 225 votes in her district.\n\nJordan Bardella , Le Pen's 28-year-old protégé who'd been hoping to become prime minister, rued that the national outcome \"throws France into the arms of the extreme left.\"\n\nA statement from Macron's office indicated that he wouldn't be rushed into inviting a potential prime minister to form a government. It said he was watching as results came in and would wait for the new National Assembly to take shape before taking \"the necessary decisions.\"\n\nUnlike other countries in Europe that are more accustomed to coalition governments, France doesn't have a tradition of lawmakers from rival political camps coming together to form a majority. France is also more centralized than many other European countries, with many more decisions made in Paris.\n\nThe president was hoping that with France's fate in their hands, voters might shift from the far right and left and return to mainstream parties closer to the center - where Macron found much of the support that won him the presidency in 2017 and again in 2022.\n\nBut rather than rally behind him, millions of voters seized on his surprise decision as an opportunity to vent their anger about inflation, crime, immigration and other grievances - including Macron's style of government.\n\nThe sharp polarization of French politics - especially in this torrid and quick campaign - is sure to complicate any effort to form a government. Racism and antisemitism marred the electoral campaign, along with Russian disinformation campaigns , and more than 50 candidates reported being physically attacked - highly unusual for France.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to remove exact seat tallies reported by French media to account for the fact that official results don't give precise totals for each main bloc.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Barbara Surk in Nice, France, and Helena Alves, Diane Jeantet, Jade Le Deley, and Alex Turnbull in Paris contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's global election coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/global-elections/\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "8 Reasons Leftists Should be Pro-Israel\n\nWriter and Senior Healthcare Analyst\n\nIsrael continues to be the demon poster-child of the Left. The prime example of a repressive regime and abuser of human rights. On the Left, people became outraged and agitated over Israel more than over any other cause. Israel's supposed villainy will bring out protestors on cold, rainy days in a way no other issue can. Many of these people are earnest, but perhaps misled.\n\nIn most ways, my own politics tend to be Liberal-Left: I support single-payer, universal healthcare, I opposed the war in Iraq and the Bush-Cheney \"imperial presidency,\" I even voted twice for Ralph Nader. However, like French philosopher Bernard Henri-Lévy, I differ on Israel and reject the demonization of Israel, whether at the United Nations, in the world media, or among American and European Leftists.\n\nIf my fellow Leftists or even Liberals think that the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement will help bring an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as well as peace to the Middle East and harmony to the community of nations, they are sadly mistaken. There is a difference between criticism and demonization , and the campaign against Israel is of the latter type. Criticism, and there is much of it within Israel's own healthy democracy, can result in positive change. But the focused attempt to demonize Israel, not undertaken against any other nation, is aimed at delegitimizing Israel and undermining its very existence, as if the problems of the world were the fault of the Israelis -- the fault of the Jews -- and if they would only go away, all would be better.\n\nNot only is this a sorry illusion, but this concerted assault on Israel itself betrays the principles of the Left.\n\nHere, then, are 8 reasons Leftists should be Pro-Israel (or, at least, Pro-Peace rather than Anti-Israel):\n\n1. Human Rights . The Left fights for human rights in the world. Even if one thinks Israel or its soldiers guilty of human rights violations (and I am not willing at the outset to grant this point), there is no international or historical comparison that could reasonably rank Israel among the worst criminals of the world or of history. Whether we look at the scale of the conflict, the numbers of lives lost, or the treatment of the press or of dissidents, there are far too many examples of bloodshed and persecution dwarfing anything done by Israel against the Palestinians over the last four decades since the Six Day War, when Israel was attacked by its neighbors. Even Arab treatment of Palestinians, such as in Jordan's Black September massacre, caused thousands of deaths, possibly more in 10 days than in four decades of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And how can we compare Israel to Mugabe's Zimbabwe, or the Chinese crackdown on Tibet and Tianneman? Or the disappearances and death squads of Latin America Square or the killing fields of Pol Pot? Let alone the genocide pursued by Hitler or Stalin's murderous reign? Let us be clear: genocide is the attempt to exterminate an entire people and culture; this is not what has happened to the Palestinians, and it is not the goal of Israeli policy. By contrast, the explicit aim of Hamas is to eliminate Israel. So, if we support human rights and oppose persecution, ought we not first to focus our efforts on the places where we find the worst situations? Can anyone rationally claim that among these places, let alone the most horrendous of all, is a small nation on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea?\n\n2. Internationalism . Leftists tend to support internationalism. One would think that the United Nations would be the world body most dedicated to furthering this aim. But how is it that Israel, this small nation, has become such a central concern? From 2003-2010, there have been more than 900 human rights actions against Israel at the U.N.; the next closest is Sudan at just under 400. Israel is the only member of the U.N. to be excluded from any of the five regional groups. And should not all on the Left oppose the absurdity of the so-called Human Rights Council, whose members include such paragons of humanitarianism as China, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Kyrgyzstan? How can Leftists stand silent when the Turkish Prime Minister denounces Israel for human rights crimes while then promising that the Kurds will \"drown in their own blood,\" in a conflict with human rights abuses on both sides and tens of thousands individuals killed? If Gaza is not the ideal place to live, if the Gazans are suffering, nevertheless the photos in the New York Times and elsewhere and the testimony of reporters clearly demonstrate that Gazans are not starving, their store shelves are not empty, whether for food or consumer goods; as difficult as the situation may be, it is simply not the pinnacle of human rights disasters, and Israel is thus not deserving of international condemnation above all other nations in the world.\n\n3. Peace . Leftists want peace. In the Middle East and elsewhere. The polls make clear that, overwhelmingly, Israelis desire peace with their neighbors; the difficult sacrifices, including the unilateral withdrawal from Gaza make this evident. Israelis are prepared for a secure, two-state solution, to live side-by-side in peace. Meanwhile, the stated goal of its enemies is to end its existence. A simple thought-experiment should make the matter starkly clear: If tomorrow Hamas and other Palestinian groups unilaterally put down their weapons, what would follow? Peace. If Israelis unilaterally put down their weapons, what would follow? Millions of dead or exiled Jews. Anyone on the Left who does not recognize this is living in denial. Leftists should support peace and not live in denial. 4. Anti-Authoritarianism . Leftists oppose authoritarianism and dictatorship and instead support popular, democratic rule. Israel maintains a vibrant, parliamentary democracy, with a broad range of views represented, much more so than in the United States, for example. Indeed, Arabs parties and Communists have long had representatives voted into the Israeli Knesset. Can we imagine such representation, as well as the freedom of assembly and freedom of speech in Israel's Arab neighbors? In the Gaza ruled by Hamas? In Egypt or Syria or Saudi Arabia? By opposing Israel and supporting groups like Hamas, the Left is not supporting a liberation struggle but rather the effort to replace the Middle East's only democracy with yet another repressive dictatorship. Do Leftists really desire such an outcome? How can the one major effort to boycott, divest, and sanction be aimed at a democratic nation like this? As Bernard Henri-Levy has written at the Huffington Post of the \"Confusion of an era when we combat democracies as though they were dictatorships or fascist States. This maelstrom of hatred and madness is about Israel. But it also concerns, as we should be well aware, some of the most precious things established in the movement of ideas in the last thirty years, especially on the left, and these are thus imperiled.\"\n\n5. Human Dignity and Equality . The Left fights for the values of dignity and equality. Are these traits exemplified more by Israel or its neighbors? Look at how much Israelis value the life of a single soldier, in the willingness to trade hundreds of prisoners for one soldier, and even to trade prisoners to recover their dead for proper burial. Look at the rules of engagement of the Israeli Defense Forces, at how the IDF calls and leaflets civilians to warn them; does any other military do such a thing? In terms of equality and human rights, compare the state of women's and gay and lesbian rights in Israel with that in the rest of the Middle East. And in terms of human dignity, do people on the Left think so little of Palestinian dignity that they are willing to claim Palestinians have \"no choice\" but to turn themselves into homicidal-suicidal bombers to kill Israeli children? Can we not expect more of people? Treating Palestinians like helpless victims does less than recognize their human dignity.\n\n6. Anti-Discrimination . Leftists oppose sexism, racism, and any similar sort of discrimination. And so, Leftists do or ought to oppose anti-Semitism in the same way. And yet, Leftists too often give a pass to anti-Semitism masked as anti-Zionism or anti-Israel sentiment. The playwright David Mamet has written in the Huffington Post as follows: \"Yet most of the Western Press, European and American, pictures Israel as, somehow the aggressor, and the Israelis as somehow inhuman, and delighting in blood.\" As Mamet has elaborated in his book The Wicked Son: Anti-Semitism, Self-Hatred, and the Jews , this is nothing less than a reworking of the old Blood Libel against the Jews--except this time, instead of being accused of using non-Jewish blood to bake matzah, the Jews are accused of spilling blood for no reason other than gratuitous pleasure. Leftists ought to be vigilant in distinguishing between constructive criticism of Israel and dehumanizing caricatures of Jews.\n\n7. Self-Defense . Only the most uncompromising pacifists oppose the right to self-defense, and certainly most Leftists uphold this right. At least when Palestinians are doing the defending. Why are Israelis exempt from this right? How many Leftists would sit idly by while rockets rained down on their towns and families, with their children traumatized? And if we said, oh, but people are only killed occasionally, would that minimize your commitment to protect your family? Only Jews are expected to lay down their weapons and offer their throats. How dare the Jews have the chutzpah to fight back?!\n\n8. Progress . We want movement on Palestinian-Israeli and Arab-Israeli peacemaking. Yet, demonizing Israel, singling it out, as is done at the UN and on college campuses will do little to advance peace. We all know, have all known for decades the basic outlines of a peace settlement. The Israelis have been prepared for this and have prepared their citizens. The Left should be pressuring Palestinians to accept peace and to stop teaching their children that Jews are monsters after their blood. This sort of pressure might bring some progress.\n\nIt was long ago time for Leftists to tear down the poster that features Israel as the demon-child of human rights abuse and repression. It is time for Leftists to become outraged not over Israel, but over the distortions and demonization of Israel on college campuses and at the United Nations and throughout the media and politics. It is time for Leftists to reject the treatment of Israel as a pariah, or Jews as bloodthirsty murderers, and time instead to welcome Israel into the community of nations as a full member, subject to the same criticism and praise as any other nation.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Why Western 'Leftists' And 'Liberals' Seem Pro-Iran's Government?\n\nPresident of the International American Council, Harvard Scholar, Political Scientist, Board Member Harvard International Review and the US-Middle East Chamber of Business and Commerce\n\n#Opinion : Why do Western 'leftists' and 'liberals' love #Iran 's government? asks Dr. Majid Rafizadeh. https://t.co/B6D9NcB6RL @Dr_Rafizadeh pic.twitter.com/Kn1WGuZRBA\n\nIt is a dilemma for many why the so-called Western \"leftists\", \"democrats\", \"socialists\" and \"liberals\", as well as the mainstream leftist media outlets, often appear to beat the drum for the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nIt seems ambiguous and perplexing that how and why some educated leftist people appear to defend the Iranian government which constantly lashes out at the West, particularly the US \" The Great Sata n\"; which advocates and promotes \"Death to America\" or \"Death to Britain\"; which is ranked top state sponsor of terrorism in the world; which regularly delivers incendiary speeches; which is ranked top in the world when it comes to executing people per capita; which represses its own citizens on a large scale; which subjugates and dehumanizes its ethnic and religious minorities; which intervenes in almost every country's domestic affairs in the region; which pursues militaristic and expansionist policies; which seeks to advance its hegemonic ambitions, regional superiority and preeminence; which is governed by a Shia theocracy ; which supports Bashar Al Assad and many militia and designated terrorist groups; and the list goes on.\n\nSome people strongly argue that some of those so-called \"leftists\", Iran \"experts\" filled in almost every sector including think thanks, or as professors in academia, or \"liberals\" get paid to secretly and illegally lobby for, and in the favor of, the Iranian government. I am not talking about these groups; my question is directed towards the other leftist groups.\n\nThe answer to this question is multidimensional and is linked to preserving ones economic, financial and career interests, as well as related to the American or Western educational systems. I will focus on the second dimension since the first one - the self-interest financial and career dimension- is self-explanatory.\n\nIn Western academic systems, including highly regarded ones, students are normally taught utilizing teaching methods that encourages enhancing critical thinking and taking the students out of their comfort zone. It appears that a significant part of shaping this critical thinking is to focus on literatures that examines Western imperialism, colonialism, and orientalism.\n\nAs a result, when it comes to Iran-US or Iran-West relationships, many develop a picture of \"we\" (the imperialists, colonialist, aggressors, and orientalists) versus \"they\" [the Iranian government] (the repressed and victims). Since the focus becomes how the US treated or mistreated Iran, the whole picture of what is happening inside Iran, what the Iranian government is doing to its people, how the Iran government is exploiting the situation, or how the Iranian government is acting in the region becomes irrelevant and is disregarded.\n\nAs a result, if you examine every Iran-West or Iran-US scenario from the above-mentioned framework, you are regarded as highly \"educated\", \"sophisticated\", \"humane\", and \"civilized\". In addition, even if Iran commits any acts that violates international law, those liberals will find ways to justify it as a way to take the blame off the Iranian government's shoulder and put the blame on the West or other countries in the region. This is how they are trained. On the other hand, if you do not follow this theoretical framework, you will be attacked with all different kinds of labels, and your credentials and qualifications will all be questioned.\n\nThe Islamic Republic Loves Western \"Liberals\" and \"Leftists\" Too\n\nThe Islamic Republic tends to love these kinds of Western \"liberals\" and \"leftists\" because they fit into Iran's agenda of demonizing and blaming the West while disregarding or justifying Iran's aggressive actions. Many are repeatedly invited to speak on Iranian media outlets or participate in other activities.\n\nMany fail to realize that this framework of thinking, which is like a box itself, has become their new comfort zone.\n\nThe major problems with this predominant framework of Western liberal and leftist thinking, which is pro-Iran government in this case, is that: it is binary, simplified, and unsophisticated, it does not reflect the nuances, and complexities of Iran's politics, and does not do any justice to the overwhelming majority of the Iranian people and others in the region, such as the Syrian people.\n\nBy only focusing on criticizing the West when it comes to its relationship with the Islamic Republic, we are overlooking the injustices and military adventurism being conducted by the Iranian government on a daily basis.\n\n\"Leftists\" and \"Liberals\" Need to Stand By The Values They Call For\n\nIn fact, by adopting such pro-Iran government thinking, we would be indirectly assisting, empowering and emboldening the Iranian government to repress its own people, torture political and human rights activists, help Assad bomb his own people, and fuel conflicts in other countries.\n\nThe questions that these \"liberals\" and \"leftists\" do not like to be asked, because it again intrudes on their comfort zone, are: Why would you stand on the side of the Iranian government which commits such violations domestically and is top state sponsor of terrorism? Can you criticize the Iranian government for ranking top in the world for executing people? Why do you defend a government that regularly detains, tortures, and imprisons its own people? Can you criticize the Iranian government that does not allow any peaceful opposition or criticism to its hold on power?\n\nUnfortunately these leftists have the megaphones and resources; their actions are hindering the abilities of millions of Iranians, human rights and political activist to democratize Iran.\n\nIn my opinion, if the leftists and liberals, as they argue, truly stand for values such as peace, social justice, freedom of speech, press and assembly, liberty, democracy, and human rights, they ought to forcefully condemn the Iranian government for violating all these values. Not only it is hypocritical not to do so, but also they would be complicit in Iran's actions and it is a betrayal and disrespect to millions of people across the region as well as the Iranian people who suffer on a daily basis under the Shia theocracy of the Islamic Republic.\n\nThis article was originally published by the Arab News .

      "text": "Leftists Who Love Israel -- A Self-Help Guide\n\nSenior Editor, Haaretz.com\n\nI'd like to talk about this problem I have. You can't talk about it to just anyone. Friends of mine have it too. But you'll never see this one on Dr. Phil. I don't care how big the self-help section is in your Borders or Waterstones, you're not going to find it there either.\n\nIt kicks in when you least expect it. And kicks is the word. Let's try to give it a name. Leftists who love Israel. And who feel - or are made to feel - like leftists who love Israel too much.\n\nBy leftists, I am including people who may describe themselves, or, without coming out to others, may know themselves to be, doves, peace activists, social democrats, Democrats , disenchanted former Meretz voters, disenchanted former Labor voters, disenchanted longtime non-voters, human rights activists, vegans, activist moderates, the ostracized Orthodox Jew, the ostracized Protestant, the broad-view Catholic, the proactive pro-social justice moderate, the anti-neocon, the girl or guy you just passed on the street in Israel. Me. You.\n\nThere was a time when this grouping represented little more than an intensely interested but effectively disenfranchised buffer between the pro-occupation right whipping Israel along the road that leads straight off a cliff, and the detest-Israel's-guts-as-a-philosophy-of-life extreme left, which sought to see the Jewish state, pretty much any Jewish state, go out of existence in any event.\n\nNo more. The success of the former, aided and abetted by the excess of the latter, has made the abyss all too tangible up ahead. These days, whether they believe it or not, leftists who love Israel are one of the nation's only hopes for survival. If there's a rescue squad out there, these people are it.\n\nNot coincidentally, this is the group most likely to become the target of the contempt and thus the very public venom of extremists on the far-right and the far-left, working in unacknowledged but full concert, keen to neutralize people they see as spineless, bloodless sell-outs.\n\nThey're warming up even as we speak - you're about to meet them at the bottom of this page, and every other. You'll know them from the characteristic incontinence of reason and the foam at the mouth.\n\nThis is where self-help comes in. The extremists, to which we will hereafter refer by their more fitting name, maniakim, will do everything they can to intimidate, humiliate, silence and paralyze the person who believes in and works for a two-state solution, who believes in and works for a Jewish state of democratic values, prophetic humanism, equality, and honorable relations with neighbors and the world at large.\n\nAs in most any self-help guide to relationships, this would be the juncture to suggest a three-point program to help leftists who love Israel, respect themselves. Not that I know better than anyone else, but the following would be my choice:\n\n1. Your Heart Counts. Be Real.\n\nWhere it comes to Israel, be as honest about what you love, as you are about what turns your stomach, chars your conscience, makes you want to throw shoes at the news. Be as up front about what you hate, as you are about what spurs inspiration, spiritual engagement, an overwhelming surge of beauty.\n\nWhere it comes to the Palestinians, train your eyes to see past fear, stereotype, hype, slander and distance, until children and their families come into focus as people trying to live the best lives they can.\n\n2. Your Faith Counts. Be Strong.\n\nNo one has a monopoly on love for Israel. Your faith in the future of a just Israel alongside an independent Palestine is certainly every bit as valid as that of pro-occupation flacks.\n\nNeither does anyone have exclusive rights to the meaning of justice. There is a name for the hard leftist who rejects the right of Jews to have a state of their own - any state in any part of the Holy Land, no matter how democratic and respectful of minority rights - but who accepts the rights of Muslims to have formally Islamic nations:\n\nAnti-Semite.\n\n3. Your Actions Count. Be Sweet.\n\nThere is no greater heroism in wartime than facing down one's fears and acting with compassion. This is war. There is an Us, and there is a Them. But it's nowhere as simple as Jews versus Arabs. The real war now, the true battle for the future, is a contest between the side which wants to see justice for both Palestinians and Israelis, and, on the other side, maniakim.\n\nLeftists who love Israel should turn their fury at the likes of Avigdor Lieberman and Eli Yishai into tangible support for the many activists who are working to reshape the country for the sake of a healthy and just future.\n\nLeftists who love Israel should actively support Israeli companies and individuals who work and produce goods in True Israel, within the Green Line, just as they support Palestinians working in the territories.\n\nTreat the maniakim the way the self-help expert Cesar Millan, the Dog Whisperer, deals with the snarling, the territorial, the aggressive, the unremittingly dominant: Exude an air of calm assertiveness. No more following. Do not be submissive. Lead.\n\nThis much the maniakim can teach leftists who love Israel:\n\nTrust your gut. Respect what you believe. Fight for it. Love is bravery. Love is hard. Love wins.You're not alone.\n\n__________________________\n\nOriginally Published on Haaretz.com"

      "text": "Why Are China's Leftists Embracing Confucius?\n\nAssociate Professor, Duke University School of Law\n\nWhen Jennifer Pan and Yiqing Xu posted their new paper, \" China's Ideological Spectrum ,\" recently, it marked the first time that anyone has provided large-scale empirical data on the ideological shifts and trends within the Chinese population. China scholars have, of course, lavished attention on these issues for years -- one cannot build a coherent argument about Chinese political and social change without grappling with them -- but their arguments were largely based on personal experiences and anecdotes. The Pan and Xu paper therefore did academic and policy circles a significant service by providing a firmer foundation for such discussion.\n\nThe paper is not intended as an accurate temperature reading on the Chinese population's ideological leanings. A voluntary online survey, with its inherent selection biases, cannot do that. What it can do, however, is measure a number of relative and relational factors: which beliefs correlate positively or negatively with each other, whether different regions lean in different directions, and whether exogenous factors such as income or education affect those relative leanings.\n\nMany of the findings are intuitive to those who have some basic familiarity with Chinese ideological trends: Respondents who are more nationalist also tend to support both the current \"Chinese Socialist\" political system -- along with the limitations it places on civil rights and liberties--and state control over the economy. In contrast, those who view \"Western ideals\" more favorably tend to support constitutional democracy, human rights, and free-market reforms. In Chinese political terminology, the former are commonly called \"leftists,\" and the latter \"liberals.\" These terms are more than mere descriptive labels; they represent fairly coherent intellectual and political factions that are consciously antagonistic towards each other. Pan and Xu find that \"leftists\" enjoy greater popular support in lower-income, inland regions, compared to wealthier coastal provinces, whereas the opposite is true for \"liberals.\"\n\nOther findings require more effort to digest: The paper finds a strong correlation between \"leftist\" beliefs and what it terms \"cultural conservatism\"-- defined as those who support \"traditional, Confucian values,\" or at least are favorably disposed towards traditional, somewhat \"Confucian,\" bodies of knowledge. For example, those who agree that \"modern Chinese society needs Confucianism,\" or that \"the ... Book of Changes (Zhouyi) can explain many things well,\" also tend to believe in maintaining state control over sectors important \"to the national economy and people's livelihoods.\"\n\nA quick survey of the current Chinese intellectual landscape tends to reinforce these correlations. With some noticeable exceptions, China's most visible Neo-Confucian advocates have, in recent years, often displayed a fairly strong affinity for leftist socioeconomic positions. Correspondingly, a number of prominent leftist intellectuals have argued for ideological continuity between Confucianism and Chinese Socialism, or, to quote the prominent Sun Yat-sen University scholar Gan Yang, \"tong san tong\" (\"connecting the three canons\"). It is hard to escape the impression that there has been a budding relationship between \"cultural conservatism\"-- or, at least, the Confucianism-oriented version discussed in the Pan and Xu paper -- and the Chinese Left.\n\nThis is a curious development indeed. Historically, the relationship between the Left and \"cultural conservatism\" has been predominantly antagonistic, to put it lightly. For most of the 20th century, leftists led the charge against what they routinely condemned as China's inhumane and counterproductive \"traditional culture.\" Confucianism, in particular, was the target of multiple political and intellectual campaigns, ranging from the May 4th Movement to the \"Criticize Lin Biao, Criticize Confucius\" campaign during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nMoreover, the ideological incompatibilities between the mainstream political views of early modern Confucian literati and the contemporary Chinese left are serious. Many, arguably most, Qing dynasty (1644-1911) elites believed strongly in limited government, lineage self-regulation, and economic decentralization. Correspondingly, the Qing state apparatus was extraordinarily small even by early modern standards, pulling in only a fraction of the annual revenue (relative to estimated GDP) that the early modern Japanese and English states collected. Most contemporary Chinese leftists champion the opposite position: They press for more robust state intervention into socioeconomic life, and perhaps for a partial return to a state-planned economy. All in all, the recent convergence between \"cultural conservatism\" and \"leftism\" represents a dramatic reversal of some longstanding and deeply-entrenched ideological positions.\n\nIdeologies do, of course, transform over time. In particular, an ideology that has experienced as much turbulence as Confucianism is bound to evolve, perhaps radically, to appeal to modern populations.\n\nNonetheless, one still has to wonder why the modern transformation of Mainland Chinese \"cultural conservatism\" took a predominantly leftist-friendly turn, as opposed to a more liberal one. A precursor movement in Taiwan and Hong Kong during the 1950s and '60s, for example, produced a version of \"Neo-Confucianism\" that emphasized its compatibility with Western democratic and free-market ideals. Why did Mainland \"cultural conservatism\" turn in a different direction, and, equally importantly, why were Mainland leftists willing to embrace -- or at least tolerate -- such a turn?\n\nOne could potentially answer this question by rehashing the old argument that Confucianism is inherently \"pro-government\" or \"pro-authority,\" and therefore naturally inclined to lean \"left,\" rather than \"right,\" on the current Chinese political spectrum. This relies, however, on a flawed conception of Confucian political ideology: As noted above, many late-Qing Confucian elites were more likely to ideologically support a decentralized socioeconomic and political system than a state-controlled one. Alternative perspectives certainly existed, but it is nonetheless difficult to argue that Confucianism is inherently \"pro-government\" in the contemporary leftist sense.\n\nA better explanation is that supporters of beleaguered ideological traditions such as Confucianism seek sociopolitical acceptance, and therefore do so by aligning themselves with mainstream ideologies. Hong Kong and Taiwanese \"Neo-Confucianism\" emerged in societies that had significant affinity for Western political ideals, whereas Mainland \"cultural conservatism\" reemerged after the Cultural Revolution in a society that remained substantially \"Chinese Socialist.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Log in to hide these messages.\n\nCompelling as it may seem, this argument, too, has some empirical difficulties: Until the past few years, the dominant socioeconomic or political positions in the Chinese intellectual world were clearly liberal ones: most intellectuals argued for greater institutional restraints on state activity, free-market reforms, and stronger protection of civil and political rights. Even today, Pan and Xu's paper finds that highly-educated individuals are generally more \"liberal\" than less educated ones. When \"cultural conservatism\" reemerged as a somewhat influential ideological position during the later 1990s, its proponents could arguably reap greater social benefits by developing a liberal affinity, rather than a leftist one. For the most part, this did not happen.\n\nWhy not? Reading the early work of prominent contemporary \"Neo-Confucian\" intellectuals such as Jiang Qing or Chen Ming, one feels that this was a carefully considered -- even principled -- decision: they saw themselves as defending \"Chinese traditions\" against a distinctly hostile \"Western liberal\" intellectual mainstream. The \"other\" they defined themselves against was not some version of socialism or leftism, which at this time was clearly a minority position, but rather a supposedly intolerant \"liberalism\" that had dominated Chinese sociopolitical thought since the 1980s.\n\nWhatever one thinks of this position, there is probably some truth to the claim that the Chinese intellectual world of the 1980s and 1990s was both predominantly liberal on political and economic issues, and distinctly hostile to \"traditional culture.\" The enormously influential documentary series \"River Elegy,\" which combined express attacks on Confucianism with thinly-veiled criticisms of the party-state apparatus, is but one example of this. Chinese liberalism was indeed often critical of traditional family structures, social hierarchies, and what it perceived as \"backwards\" elements of Confucian political and economic thought. In the intellectual world, at least, Chinese \"cultural conservatism\" and leftism did share two important commonalities: both were minority positions facing a perceived liberal majority, and both encountered significant hostility from this perceived majority.\n\nThis may, in fact, be the missing explanatory element. Ideologies regularly define themselves against a perceived \"other,\" and in this case there was quite plausibly a common and powerful \"other\" that both \"cultural conservatism\" and political leftism defined themselves against. This also explains why leftists have, since the 1990s, become considerably more tolerant, even accepting, of \"cultural conservatism\" than they were for virtually the entire 20th century. The need to accumulate additional ideological resources to combat a perceived \"Western liberal\" other is a powerful one, and it seems perfectly possible that this could have overridden whatever historical antagonism, or even substantive disagreement, existed between the two positions.\n\nIf this is true, then one of the most important takeaways from Pan and Xu's paper is that the educated Chinese population continues to formulate its ideological positions either against or in support of some perception of \"the West.\" In some fundamental way, we continue to define ourselves vis-à-vis the \"Western other.\" This is, in fact, how the Chinese intellectual and political world has operated since the late Qing, when the influx of Western technology, institutions, and thought forced Confucian elites to fundamentally reorient their ideological commitments. Perhaps more than any flawed conception of \"Confucian culture,\" this is what we should be grappling with when considering the influence of \"historical tradition\" on contemporary Chinese society."

If he persists in this mad act of imperial aggression, it will be catastrophic not only for Ukraine but for Russia and all of Europe - and maybe even the entire world. With his forces encircling Kyiv but bogged down after five days of heavy combat, Putin placed Russia's nuclear forces on alert.\n\nIf you identify as a leftist, wherever you live and whatever your nationality, your duty now is to stand by the people of Ukraine as they resist Russian state terrorism - and to stand by those thousands of Russian citizens courageously protesting the war in dozens of cities across their country. If you opposed the criminal U.S. attack on Iraq in 2003, then you must oppose this criminal attack on Ukraine. Not just consistency, but a minimal degree of decency and human solidarity requires it. Putin's war is a blatant violation of international law against an independent country that posed no threat to Russia.\n\nSolidarity with the oppressed - regardless of race, religion, nationality, gender, and so on - must be the driving force of leftist politics if they are to have any ethical value. Unfortunately, a small but loud faction that claims to be on the left and to be anti-imperialist has for years backed deeply oppressive dictatorships around the world, from Syria's Bashar al-Assad, who declared war against his own people, to the Chinese government, which has forcibly detained up to a million Turkic Muslims in internment camps , to Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega, who abandoned the left many years ago and now rules over his country as a right-wing dictator .\n\nThese pseudo-leftists - sometimes called \"tankies,\" a name deriving from an earlier generation of Western leftists who backed the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 - also defend Russia's behavior today. Other commentators like Gilbert Achcar and Dan La Botz have explained this crowd's origins in detail, but the key element in the tankie mindset is the simple-minded assumption that only the U.S. can be imperialist, and thus any country that opposes the U.S. must be supported. As author and human rights activist Leila Al-Shami put it several years ago, \"The pro-fascist left seems blind to any form of imperialism that is non-western in origin. It combines identity politics with egoism. Everything that happens is viewed through the prism of what it means for westerners - only white men have the power to make history.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIn the present context, the tankies either directly defend, or make excuses for, Putin and Russia, even though the government is phenomenally corrupt, a crony capitalist regime led by a thug who assassinates his political opponents. The tankies tend to be correctly critical and probing about U.S. empire but don't apply these critical faculties to Russia. They become gullible and naïve when dealing with Russian officials and their narrative. It would be tempting simply to ignore the tankies, but we must repudiate them. If we don't, they will continue to give the left a bad name, especially among people fighting repressive regimes, who often assume tankies speak for the rest of us and thus feel betrayed by Western leftists.\n\nWhat the tankies fail to acknowledge is that Putin's regime is as deeply reactionary socially as it is repressive politically. That's why right-wing extremists in western Europe and the U.S., including Tucker Carlson and Steve Bannon, have applauded him, and why neo-Nazis have celebrated him as the savior of the white race. In supporting Putin, the tankies are in league with the far right.\n\nLike American leaders when they engage in imperial ventures, Putin does not see his invasion as an illegal war. In a long, potted essay last summer, he argued that the two countries are \"one people, a single whole\" and criticized Lenin's establishment of the Soviet Union as a federation of equal republics with each having the right of secession. Russia, Putin claimed, \"was robbed\" by the Bolsheviks. He wrote that the \"true sovereignty of Ukraine is possible only in partnership with Russia.\" The message could not have been clearer: Ukraine has no right to genuine independence; it belongs to Russia. This policy toward Ukraine is more reminiscent of 19th-century Great Russian chauvinism than anything else.\n\nPutin heightened the rhetoric to fever pitch after ordering Russia's \" special military operation .\" He absurdly accused Ukraine of committing \"genocide\" in regions of eastern Ukraine where the Russian language dominates and separatists have a foothold. Putin called Ukraine's government a \"junta\" led by a \"gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis,\" and he declared that the goal of the invasion was to \"demilitarize and denazify Ukraine.\" Ukraine led by Nazis? The president, Volodymyr Zelensky, who was elected in 2019 by a landslide, is a Jew whose relatives were murdered in the Holocaust. Though there are fascist militias in Ukraine, just as there are in the U.S. and other Western countries, Ukrainians have repeatedly and decisively rejected neo-Nazis and right-wing extremists at the polls.\n\nResponsibility for this war rests with Russia and Russia alone. But that should not obscure the fact that NATO, led by Washington, laid the groundwork for confrontation with a series of missteps after the breakup of the Soviet Union, provocations that fueled Russian resentment and fears of Western encirclement. First came the ill-advised expansion of NATO in the late 1990s, which was criticized not only by the left , but by a long and impressive list of former establishment cold warriors , including George Kennan, Richard Pipes, Sam Nunn, and many more. Western leaders had an opportunity to reorder the European security architecture in a way that included Russia at the highest levels after the fall of the Soviet Union. Instead, led by President Bill Clinton, they committed to the eastward expansion of NATO, an organization built on the premise of confrontation with Russia.\n\nEven more misguided was the Western vow in 2008 to include Ukraine and Georgia in NATO. As Anatol Lieven, a Russia specialist at the Quincy Institute, put it in a recent interview : \"We never had the slightest intention of defending Ukraine, not the slightest.\" NATO's declaration, he said, was \"deeply immoral\" for its hollowness. President Joe Biden's current CIA Director William Burns, a veteran Russia expert formerly at the State Department, has long argued against both of those provocations , most recently in a memoir published just a few years ago. Even New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, that popinjay of pompous platitudes and parrot of establishment opinion, noted that , in this unfolding disaster, \"America and NATO are not just innocent bystanders.\"\n\nWhat now? We must demand a full and unconditional withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine, and we must insist that the United States and NATO keep to their repeated public vows not to get directly involved militarily. Some of the sanctions may do more harm to the Russian people than to their government; the freezing of the government's foreign bank reserves could bring the entire Russian economy to its knees. But freezing the money secretly stashed overseas by wealthy Russians - which some economists estimate could amount to as much as 85 percent of the country's GDP - would be a good way to narrowly target Putin and the oligarchs surrounding him.\n\nFor the left, solidarity with Ukrainians under Russian siege is just as vital as solidarity with Palestinians suffering under Israeli apartheid, Yemenis being bombed by U.S. ally Saudi Arabia, or any other people fighting oppressive regimes. As Martin Luther King Jr. said, injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "While the Media Panicked About Campus Leftists, the Far Right Surged\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nTwo new reports examine the growing threat of far-right propaganda and violence.\n\nIf a reader were to judge from popular media accounts, the biggest threat to university life and public discourse would be obvious: the left-wing students on campus fighting various forms of bigotry and other injustices. From liberal broadsheets to Breitbart.com, commentators have taken up a strawman debate - largely shaped by the far right - about campus free speech. Tactics like \"no-platforming\" and physically confronting neo-Nazis have come under the liberal microscope; the ethics questioned, the proponents decried as the real fascistic force on campus.\n\nAs Adam Johnson, a contributing analyst for Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, told me, a November study he conducted found that the \"New York Times has dedicated 21 columns and articles to the subject of conservatives' free speech on campus, while only three covered the silencing of college liberals or leftists.\"\n\nBut recently released reports from a pair of prominent nonprofit organizations tell a different story, focusing on the danger we should be addressing: the increased targeting of student spaces by neo-Nazis and white supremacists, and the violence these ideologies entail.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League reported that incidents of white supremacist propaganda on U.S. campuses more than tripled in 2017. Groups doubling down on campus propagandizing include explicit neo-Nazis like the Florida-based Atomwaffen Division, as well as associations like Identity Evropa, known for couching its unabashed racist message in thinly veiled panegyrics to protecting Western culture and posters bearing Michelangelo's David.\n\n\"The 'alt-right' is a movement of mostly young white males,\" Carla Hill, senior researcher for the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism, told me. \"They realize that for any movement to truly grow, they must reach young minds, and this segment of the white supremacist movement has been focused on doing that.\"\n\nThe potential gravity of this surge was then underlined by a report from the Southern Poverty Law Center, titled simply, \"The Alt-Right Is Killing People.\" More than 100 people have been killed or injured since 2014 by perpetrators believed to be influenced by the racism and misogyny that defines the so-called alt-right, the center found. More than 60 people were killed or injured in \"alt-right\" violence last year alone.\n\nThe reports draw no direct link between the rise in white supremacist propaganda and the spike in white supremacist murders. But together, they make clear that the threat of \"alt-right\" influence on young people, above all young white men, is anything but academic: Racist ideology is never free of violence, and neither is it in the case of the cosplaying, Nazi-adjacent trolls of the \"alt-right.\"\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League reported separately in November that white supremacists and other far-right extremists were responsible for 59 percent of all extremist-related fatalities in the U.S. in 2017, up from 20 percent in 2016. While it's too soon for much dispositive social science on the link, it's difficult to consider all this data outside of the Trump era in American politics.\n\nOver a year ago, there was no shortage of coverage predicting this sort of uptick in racist violence. The possibility of it occupied the liberal commentariat as Donald Trump's presidency loomed as an unlikely aberration. Opinion pages in late 2016 ran dozens of pieces wondering whether a Trump regime would be a truly fascist one, warning of emboldened white supremacy and neo-Nazism.\n\nThe predictions have, to an extent, come to fruition: As the Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center reports shows, the American far right is sucking up more and more oxygen and exacting an increasingly deadly toll on the country. Trump, for his part, has veered dangerously close to condoning the far right's violence; at the very least, he has sought to diffuse blame for it .\n\nEven as bigotry and racist violence have dug into their footholds over the course of the last year, many of the same liberal publications once seemingly obsessed with the threat of fascism have devoted more energy to decrying the students and staff organizing to expunge hate from their midst.\n\nAt New York Magazine, for example, centrist ideologue Jonathan Chait decried the \"repressive methods and slogans\" of leftists chanting, \"Shut it down!\" New York Times neoconservative Bari Weiss tweeted in horror that it was \"amazing to watch leftists turn free speech into a right-wing issue.\" In a New York Times op-ed , the president of the University of Oregon, Michael H. Schill, said the campus \"crusade\" against fascism was \"misguided.\"\n\nAfter the right-wing \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, descended into violence, including the killing of a protester by a far-right rally-goer, Trump came under heavy criticism for blaming \"both sides.\" Yet the mainstream media has too frequently adopted an almost identical stance when it comes to the balance of coverage between left-wing and right-wing demonstrators. In the month following the rally, America's six top broadsheet newspapers ran 28 opinion pieces condemning anti-fascist action, according to FAIR, but only 27 condemning neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and Trump's failure to disavow them.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League's November report evidences the flaws in this \"two sides\" position. The group found the far right was responsible for 71 percent of domestic extremist killings in 2017, but only 3 percent of killings were attributed to \"left-wing extremism\" - and even reaching this figure meant the Anti-Defamation League lumped together \"anarchists and black nationalists.\"\n\n\"Alt right\" and neo-Nazi organizers - where there is significant overlap - make no secret of the rhetorical Trojan horse they use to infiltrate campus discourse. When white supremacist groups like the white nationalists of the National Policy Institute, along with Identity Evropa, began targeting college campuses in the spring of 2016, they were explicit in their cooption of the liberal lexicon of \"safe spaces\" and free speech protections.\n\n\"Here it is, the birth of the free speech movement,\" pronounced far-right group Red Ice in May 2016, at a small rally at the University of Berkeley, California. It was a potent combination: a cynical adoption of traditional liberal and leftist speech mixed with a genuine desire to be able spread ideologies of hate in public without interference. Liberal centrists swallowed it whole.\n\nWittingly or not, it was a devilish sleight of hand: neo-fascists relying on American liberalism's unmatched fetishization of protected speech in order to claim that the real fascists are in fact the ones who would see them silenced.\n\nDebates about whether to give a platform to far-right speakers, and which ones, are about ethics and tactics. These issues have been addressed at length - including by me - and we don't need to go over it all again. Suffice to say that the anti-authoritarian antifa groups criticized for violating the First Amendment rights of white supremacists are not in the habit of asking for government or institutional suppression of anything, let alone speech.\n\nThe decision to counter hate speech with confrontational protest is not a constitutional violation, even if certain tactics cross the line into illegality. And for the most part, anti-fascist strategy is to draw large protests crowds in order shut down far-right gatherings, using numbers to reduce the likelihood of violence.\n\nAll this comes amid a very real threat to progressive students and faculty on campus - to their lives, yes, but also their livelihoods, and even, dare we say it, their ability to speak out. When faculty members have come under attack and lose positions for their support of the international boycott against Israel, when events on the issue have been canceled , and Israel lobbyists push for banning boycott activity on campus, no cottage industry of media outrage emerges to crow about pro-Palestinian groups' free speech.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League, for its part, is a longtime foe of the Palestinian rights movement, boycotts of Israel, and antifa actions. But even with this history, the group is issuing dire warnings about the immediate dangers of the modern far right - something much of the media has still failed to capture with the necessary gravity.\n\nTo be generous, the media focus on the free speech canard could reflect the reasonable assumption that readers already know emboldened white supremacy is bad. To be less generous - and more realistic - liberal and centrist media institutions don't care as much about white supremacy as they claim to. White supremacy has never stood at odds with the American status quo. Its rise on college campuses is a disgrace, but in itself is not a disruption.\n\nCorrection: Feb. 14, 2018 Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this story said the SPLC reported that more than 100 people were killed by \"alt-right\" violence last year. The story has been updated to reflect that the number was based on killings and injuries since 2014, with more than 60 killings and injuries last year.\n\nTop photo: White nationalists, neo-Nazis, and members of the \"alt-right\" clash with counterprotesters as they attempt to guard the entrance to Emancipation Park during the \"Unite the Right\" rally Aug. 12, 2017 in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Trump's Turn From Immigration to the Enemy Within\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nTrump's shift from demonizing immigrants to targeting leftists is straight out of the fascist playbook.\n\nListening to Donald Trump describe the U.S. in 2016 was to hear a story of a nation in peril of losing its identity to waves of brown-skinned invaders. Immigration and the border, particularly the urgent need to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico, dominated Trump's campaign rhetoric. Once in office, the president's top immigration adviser, Stephen Miller, rammed through one punishing initiative after another, banning travelers from Muslim-majority countries, separating immigrant children from their parents to deter others from making the journey north, forcing tens of thousands of asylum-seekers to wait out their cases in the border's most dangerous cities, and plowing through protected lands to stand up towering new sections of border wall. Today, asylum at the border is effectively dead, and Trump's Department of Homeland Security is using the coronavirus as a pretext to boot immigrants out of the country - including families, children, and babies - as swiftly as possible.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nSo it may have come as a surprise to some that immigration hardly came up at all in the first presidential debate of 2020. This is at least partially due to the fact that the Trump administration's framing of its priorities has evolved over the past several months, as waves of protests challenging the power and brutality of American policing have swept the country. Without question, the anti-immigrant machinery marches on. In July, the Migration Policy Institute catalogued more than 400 executive actions the administration has taken on immigration since Trump's inauguration. Those policies continue to impact countless individuals and families across the country and around the world every day, and if the claims of a former top DHS official are true, Miller has an immigration campaign of \" shock and awe \" drawn up and ready to go should Trump remain in office. But with those efforts simultaneously in motion, the Trump administration has increasingly and prominently centered purported threats posed by leftists, anarchists, and anti-fascists in its bid to hold onto power. This widening of the threat aperture is straight out of the authoritarian playbook, said Jason Stanley, a professor of philosophy at Yale University and author of \" How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them .\"\n\n\"You begin with something that separates citizens from noncitizens,\" Stanley told The Intercept, explaining how fascistic power grabs often take place. \"You have your colonial war, your war on terror, your imperialist war that focuses on distinguishing between citizens and noncitizens, and then you direct that force inwards against your political opponents.\"\n\nIn the case of Trump, the first three years of the administration featured talk of threats from MS-13 gang members, migrant caravans marching north through Mexico, Islamic State killers hidden among refugee populations and more - all were couched in terms of threats to the homeland, an \"invasion\" that posed a danger to national security and warranted decisive law enforcement and military responses. In some cases, such as the October 2018 migrant caravans that led to military deployments to the border during the midterm elections, the supposedly increased severity of the threat coincided with important electoral moments. From the outset, the White House has argued that certain jurisdictions, so-called sanctuary cities typically run by members of the president's opposing political party, provide cover for dangerous outsiders. In response, DHS has launched high-profile blitzes into these cities, at times deploying militarized Border Patrol tactical units to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations deep in urban settings and often producing media-ready photo and video packages to illustrate the president's resolve.\n\nThe administration's framing of its adversaries entered a new phase with the killing of George Floyd and the protests that followed, as the country witnessed a challenge to the legitimacy of policing unlike anything in recent memory. While the vast majority of those protests followed the traditional nonviolent civil rights model, the uprising began with a police precinct being set ablaze, and to this day, a considerable number of protesters remain unapologetic when it comes to the militancy of their demands and actions. Against the backdrop of this upheaval, the Trump administration has embraced what Stanley would describe as the second phase of a fascistic power grab: the turn inward.\n\nAnti-racist and anti-fascist protesters fight over a Confederate flag with members of far-right militias in a white pride organization rally near Stone Mountain Park in Stone Mountain, Ga., on Aug. 15, 2020.\n\nThe president has described the leaderless anti-fascist movement known as antifa as a terrorist organization and the conservative media ecosystem has fallen in line behind him. As The Intercept reported in July and as a senior DHS whistleblower attested to last month, the nation's top Homeland Security officials have downplayed the lethal threat from right-wing extremists and white supremacists amid the unrest, while boosting the president's talk of threats from the left. A number of the Democrat-led communities that were sanctuary cities at the beginning of the year have now been declared \" anarchist jurisdictions ,\" and Border Patrol tactical teams, among other specialized federal units, have deployed to those cities with a revised mission.\n\nStanley's argument is not that the U.S. currently has a fascist government - at least not yet. Instead, he draws attention to the concerning features of Trumpism. \"It's a cult of the leader, all about Trump,\" he said. \"It's a fascist social and political movement.\" The identification of enemies is central to such movements, he argued, and quite often involves creating linkages between criminalized immigrant populations and the political left. \"It's the KKK ideology,\" Stanley said, explaining the roots of Trump's line of argumentation. \"The Ku Klux Klan says Marxist Jews are trying to provoke a race war with Black Americans and they're trying to bring immigrants and destroy the white race.\" Variations on this argument have become known as the \" great replacement theory ,\" and it has made its way into the manifestos and online rants of murderous racist terrorists from El Paso and Pittsburgh to Norway and New Zealand. \"The idea is that leftists are bringing immigrants in to destroy the white race,\" Stanley said. \"Immigration is a communist plot to destroy the racial character of the nation so that the communists can take over.\"\n\nIn the United States, the DHS, the nation's largest law enforcement agency by far, would present an attractive tool to any would-be authoritarian looking to stem this takeover. Customs and Border Protection alone, one of the department's nearly two-dozen component agencies, has an aircraft fleet roughly the size of the Brazilian air force . DHS operates a nationwide network of law enforcement \"fusion centers\" designed to inform state and local partners about the threats officers might face in the field. As The Intercept reported in July, the DHS intelligence shop distributing much of that information - the same office that top DHS officials are accused of manipulating in Trump's favor - has repeatedly disseminated reports describing opponents of the president's border and immigration policies as domestic terrorists.\n\n\"We have this massive quasi-military organization devoted to targeting noncitizens and vilifying them as terrorists,\" Stanley said. \"All you've got to do is move that over one little notch to focus on political opponents.\"\n\nActing Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on the Constitution about \"anarchist violence\" in the Dirksen Senate Office Building in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 4, 2020.\n\nIn the face of the recent protests, the politicization of DHS operations that defined Trump's first three and a half years in office, primarily through immigration enforcement, has soared to new heights. Chad Wolf and Ken Cuccinelli, the two men leading the department - both illegally occupying their posts , according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office - have repeatedly leaned into Trump's argument that antifa poses a profound danger to national security, despite evidence produced by their own office and other federal law enforcement agencies that groups on the far right present the most persistent and ongoing domestic terror threat in the country. Under their leadership, DHS immigration enforcement personnel, including Border Patrol and ICE agents, were deployed to Portland, Oregon, a site of ongoing Black Lives Matter protests, against the wishes of local elected leaders. The move was repeatedly criticized for exacerbating rather than calming the unrest.\n\nThe ascent of Wolf and Cuccinelli is part of a broader hollowing out of leadership at DHS , which has effectively left in place only those who are loyal to the lone survivor of Trump's original 2016 brain trust: Stephen Miller.\n\n\"The Democratic Party for a long time historically has been the party of secession - what you're seeing today is the Democratic Party returning to its roots,\" Miller told Fox News talk-show host Tucker Carlson in July, when asked about the protests in Portland. \"The mayors of these cities that have engaged in these kinds of lawless rebellions against federal law, against immigration enforcement, have engaged in unprecedented activity, and this administration, for the first time in history, has taken action to restore immigration enforcement after five decades of bipartisan betrayal of the American worker.\" He added: \"This is about the survival of this country and we will not back down.\"\n\nThough best known for his war on immigrants, Miller's political awakening is in fact rooted in bone-deep anti-leftism. \"One of Stephen Miller's main strengths and his original philosophy was about attacking the left,\" Jean Guerrero, an investigative journalist and author of \" Hatemonger: Stephen Miller, Donald Trump, and the White Nationalist Agenda ,\" told The Intercept. \"The focus on the left is the logical conclusion of Miller's ideology.\"\n\nIn her account of Miller's upbringing in southern California, Guerrero details how a teenage Miller came up under David Horowitz, a man who renounced his ties to groups like the Black Panthers in the 1960s and 1970s and devoted the rest of his life to a war on the political left. In college, Guerrero explains, Miller's anti-leftism became bound up in great replacement theorizing, which in turn laid the foundation for his views on immigration and border security. \"It boils down to the idea that the United States faces an existential threat in the form of the Democratic Party partnering with Muslims and other people of color,\" Guerrero said. \"He saw the immigration system as a way of realizing this white nationalist agenda.\" In 2015, as an aide to then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, Miller encouraged reporters at Breitbart's right-wing news site to write about \" The Camp of the Saints,\" a racist French novel rooted in great replacement theory.\n\nIn addition to describing immigrants in grotesquely dehumanizing terms, the book argues that the downfall of Western civilization can be traced to the political left, particularly the \"anti-racists,\" \"agitators\" and \"anarchists,\" who stand in solidarity with refugees. For Guerrero, it is these passages that sound increasingly relevant today. \"A lot of people talk about how it demonizes people of color, which it does,\" she said. \"But one of the most striking things to me is the echoes in the rhetoric about anti-racists in the book and what we now see in Trump's reelection rhetoric, describing anti-racist protesters as agitators and anarchists and trying to paint the entire left as a mob that wants to destroy this country, which is essentially the white genocide theory.\"\n\nThe Proud Boys, a far-right pro-Trump group, gather with their allies in a rally called \"End Domestic Terrorism Against Antifa\" in Portland, Ore., on Sept. 26, 2020. Photo: John Rudoff/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images.\n\nAmong the most troubling of the president's actions is his courting of armed, right-wing paramilitary groups and his confidence that the nation's security forces are not apolitical institutions, but rather eager and engaged supporters of his \"law and order\" agenda.\n\n\"Stand back and stand by,\" Trump told the Proud Boys, a neo-fascist street-fighting gang, during Tuesday night's debate. The comment was widely seen as an order from the commander-in-chief to an organization that the Southern Poverty Law Center lists as a hate group, including among the group's own leaders and members . Trump also weighed in on the killing of Michael Reinoehl, a self-described anti-fascist, by law enforcement in Oregon last month. In an interview published by Vice News shortly before his death, Reinoehl said he shot and killed Aaron J. Danielson, a supporter of far-right group Patriot Prayer, days earlier in an effort to defend a friend. An eyewitness has claimed that Reinoehl was gunned down without warning. Referencing the killing in Tuesday night's debate, Trump said law enforcement \"took care of business.\" He previously called the killing an act of \"retribution.\"\n\nTrump has similarly defended Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old fan of the president and the police accused of murdering two Black Lives Matter protesters and wounding a third in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Echoing the president's line, documents obtained by NBC News this week revealed that DHS personnel were directed to make sympathetic comments about the accused shooter and told that the media was falsely painting Patriot Prayer as a racist organization. Both Danielson and Rittenhouse have achieved martyr status on the far right. Their names were invoked again and again at a Proud Boys rally in Portland last weekend. Though small in numbers, the rally was drenched in the rhetoric of civil conflict and allegiance to the president and the nation's security forces. \" Thin Blue Line \" flags were ubiquitous at the event, as were the letters \"RWDS,\" short for the words \"right-wing death squads.\"\n\nThe blurring of lines between his support in right-wing paramilitary groups and law enforcement agencies has been a consistent feature of Trump's presidency. In July, Vice President Mike Pence's visit with Philadelphia's police union also featured members of the local Proud Boys chapter. Meanwhile, violent \"Back the Blue\" protests in Arizona have featured participants fantasizing about the murder of their leftist political opponents . In an exchange Tuesday night, Trump pressed Biden to name one law enforcement agency that's come out in support of his campaign. Biden did not. Trump, meanwhile, has enjoyed extensive support from law enforcement unions across the country, from those representing Border Patrol agents and ICE deportation officers, to the Fraternal Order of Police.\n\n\"He's been wooing the security forces his entire term,\" Stanley said. As Tuesday night's debate wrapped up, Trump explicitly encouraged his supporters to head to election polls and be on the lookout for suspicious activity in what he predicted would be \"a fraud like you've never seen.\" Courting paramilitary groups and loyal security services, calling the integrity of the election into question, and urging his supporters to take it upon themselves to respond are \"classic fascist tactics,\" Stanley argued.\n\n\"He's been using fascist tactics, unquestionably, and he's already transformed many of these things into policy, particularly around immigration,\" he said. \"Now he's turning to his political opponents, so now we're really facing the concern about transformation into a fascist regime.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Will Aaron Bushnell's Death Trigger Anarchism Witch Hunt?\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nSen. Tom Cotton demands the Pentagon root out leftist extremism.\n\nAaron Bushnell's death by self-immolation in front of the Israeli Embassy in Washington last month has provoked nationwide soul-searching about the war in Gaza. For the U.S. government though, the airman's death excites a different kind of search: for so-called extremists, particularly left-wing ones.\n\nLast Wednesday, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., former Army officer and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, sent a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin asking why and how the Pentagon could tolerate an airman like Bushnell in its ranks. Calling his death \"an act of horrific violence\" that was \"in support of a terrorist group [Hamas],\" Cotton goes on to ask about the Defense Department's internal efforts to address extremism and whether Bushnell was ever identified as exhibiting extremist views or behaviors.\n\nCotton's agitation to find Hamas supporters in uniform twists Bushnell's political act, which Bushnell said was in support of the Palestinian people. But it also follows a longstanding urging by other members of Congress like Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa - ranking Republican of the Judiciary Committee and former president pro tempore of the Senate - for the military to pursue some kind of similar treatment for leftists.\n\nWhile studies show that support for extremism is similar or even lower among veterans than the general population, extremism in the active-duty military has become an obsession of the Washington brass since January 6. Soon after taking office, new secretary of defense Austin, a retired Army general, directed the military to conduct an all-hands \"stand down\" to address extremism in the ranks, commissioning a number of panels and studies to evaluate white nationalism and neo-Nazi support among service members.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nOutside of the Defense Department, the FBI is responsible for domestic counterterrorism. Since Israel's war on Gaza began last October, it has been focused on any foreign blowback on the United States.\n\n\"In a year when the [foreign] terrorism threat was already elevated, the ongoing war in the Middle East has raised the threat of an attack against Americans inside the United States to a whole 'nother level,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray told cadets at West Point on Monday. \"We cannot - and do not - discount the possibility that Hamas or another foreign terrorist organization may exploit the current conflict to conduct attacks here, on our own soil,\" Wray told Congress right after the Gaza war began.\n\nWill Bushnell's death, and congressional pressure, open the door to build some speculative link between domestic supporters of Palestine and the bureau's foreign-oriented anti-Hamas work?\n\nThough Bushnell's suicide was intended to demonstrate his anguish over the plight of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, he also embraced anarchism, or at least a present-day articulation of anarchism that is a general rejection of established authority. Bushnell's posts on Reddit and other social media platforms before his death reflected this embrace of anarchism, and he chose the anarchist symbol as his profile picture for the Twitch account he used to livestream his self-immolation. His Facebook page also followed and liked pages for several anarchist groups. The anarchist collective CrimethInc. also said in a blog post that Bushnell had emailed the group shortly before his death.\n\nBushnell was also a community activist in San Antonio, Texas, where he was stationed. The Democratic Socialists of America San Antonio chapter issued a statement expressing solidarity with Bushnell and mentioning his work with them on homelessness. \"He was an anarchist,\" a San Antonio DSA member who interacted with Bushnell told The Intercept, asking that their name not be used. \"He had a good nose for recognizing coercive / unhealthy organizing structures and practices; and was very intentional about his relationships with other people.\"\n\nSince 2019, the FBI has used five \"threat categories\" to describe domestic terrorism: Racially or Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremism, Anti-Government or Anti-Authority Violent Extremism (AGAAVE), Animal Rights or Environmental Violent Extremism, Abortion-Related Violent Extremism, and \"All Other Domestic Terrorism Threats,\" which is defined as \"furtherance of political and/or social agendas which are not otherwise exclusively defined under one of the other threat categories.\"\n\nThe AGAAVE threat, the FBI says , \"includes anarchist violent extremists, militia violent extremists, sovereign citizen violent extremists, and other violent extremists.\" FBI data reveals that 31 percent of its investigations relate to AGAAVEs and 60 percent of all investigations include cases categorized as AGAAVE and \"civil unrest.\" Most of that focus since January 6 has been on groups that participated in the protests at the Capitol and supporters of Donald Trump.\n\nBehind the scenes though, according to congressional testimony reported here for the first time, the FBI maintains a program specifically for combating anarchists, called the Anarchist Extremism Program. In Senate testimony, the FBI says that it had increased its targeting of anarchist \"violent extremists\" across the country by using both human and technical sources to spy on them. Since the nationwide protests after the death of George Floyd in 2020, the bureau has tasked field offices to tap confidential informants to develop better intelligence about anarchists. In 2021, the FBI more than doubled its domestic terrorism caseload; and Wray told Congress that arrests of what the bureau calls \"anarchist violent extremists\" were more numerous in 2020-2021 (the months around January 6) than in the three previous years combined.\n\nAn internal FBI threat advisory obtained by The Intercept defines Anarchist Violent Extremists as individuals \"who consider capitalism and centralized government to be unnecessary and oppressive,\" and \"oppose economic globalization; political, economic, and social hierarchies based on class, religion, race, gender, or private ownership of capital; and external forms of authority represented by centralized government, the military, and law enforcement.\"\n\nBy the FBI's definition, little of this applies to Bushnell's own articulation of his political views, despite the anarchist label. But the airman's protest fulfills the push by many Republicans and conservatives to get the FBI to equally focus on leftists. In a 2021 hearing, Grassley pushed for more investigations of those on the left, alluding to the bureau's anarchist extremism program.\n\n\"Former Attorney General Barr stated that the FBI has robust programs for white supremacy and militia extremism, but a significantly weaker anarchist extremism program,\" Grassley said to Wray. \"How do you plan to make your left-wing anarchist extremism program as robust as your white supremacy and malicious extremism program?\"\n\nAt a press briefing last Thursday that discussed Bushnell's ties to anarchism, the Pentagon appeared to hint that his death might be considered an act of extremism.\n\n\"A review of Aaron Bushnell's social media account indicates that he has some pretty strong anarchist views,\" a reporter asked. \"Under the Pentagon's definition of extremists, would he fall under that?\"\n\n\"I do think it's fair to say that suicide by self immolation is an extreme act,\" Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder replied, promising a \"full investigation.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "For Some Reason, We Can't Find a Single Leftist Mark Zuckerberg Invited to His Dinners With Pundits From \"Across the Spectrum\"\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nWe asked The Nation, Mother Jones, Jacobin, Black Agenda Report, Chapo Trap House, and more: They all said their invitation from the Facebook CEO never arrived.\n\nDuring a congressional hearing on Wednesday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked Mark Zuckerberg about his \"ongoing dinner parties with far-right figures.\"\n\nThis was terribly unfair to Mark, and Ocasio-Cortez owes him an apology. Yes, as Politico recently reported , he's been holding lots of private get-togethers with prominent hard-right media figures. According to the article, these include Tucker Carlson of Fox News; talk show host Hugh Hewitt; Ben Shapiro; former Free Beacon editor Matt Continetti; and Brent Bozell, founder of the Media Research Center, which exists \"to expose and neutralize the propaganda arm of the Left: the national news media.\"\n\nBut this isn't because Mark is cultivating right-wingers specifically . Rather, as he explained on Facebook , he just loves to have dinner with \"lots of people across the spectrum on lots of different issues all the time.\"\n\nSo obviously - given Mark's thirst for meeting new people, hearing from a wide range of viewpoints, and the joy of learning - he's also constantly hanging out with prominent leftists. All that remains now is to document it.\n\nAsked to name some of these leftists, a Facebook spokesperson responded, \"We don't have anything further to share on this subject beyond what Mark posted.\"\n\nWell, OK. Mark is probably sensitive to the privacy of his left-wing dinner companions and doesn't want to mention them without checking first.\n\nBut we can assume that Mark's been getting together with people from The Nation, founded in 1865 and the flagship of America's progressive news outlets. Strangely, however, the Nation's editor, D. D. Guttenplan, says that while he'd love to share a meal with Mark \"to discuss The Nation's sharp takes on politics and culture - particularly those pointed at Facebook \" - he's never been asked.\n\nIt would also be natural for Mark to have dinner with the top brass at Mother Jones, especially since they're right there in the San Francisco Bay Area with Facebook and have won many awards for their muckraking progressive journalism. However, that doesn't seem to have happened either.\n\nBut The Nation and Mother Jones probably aren't radical enough for Mark, and he wants to talk ideas with committed socialists with a comprehensive critique of the racialized history of American capitalism. Oddly, though, Margaret Kimberley, co-founder of Black Agenda Report, claims that she too has not attended dinner with him. Kimberley adds, \"I'm not aware of any leftists being among the chosen few. Then again, we don't get Atlantic Council seal of approval and that is the point.\"\n\nSeth Ackerman, executive editor of Jacobin, the energetic and much lauded socialist magazine, also asserts that he has not been sharing meals with Mark, but acknowledges that \"I have watched clips of his hypnotic 'smoking some meats' livestream .\"\n\nWill Menaker, co-host of the popular podcast Chapo Trap House, says he's never received an invitation from Mark - although when pressed, he admits, \"I don't check the email very often.\"\n\nThen there's Current Affairs, a young leftist magazine based in New Orleans. \"In a strange coincidence,\" states its editor Nathan Robinson, \"all of the socialists I have spoken with have failed to receive our invitations. I blame the post office.\" (Robinson predictably does not note that the post office, the organization that has failed him, is a socialist institution.)\n\nFinally, Jim Naureckas of Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting - something of a left-wing, reality-based counterpart to Bozell's Media Research Center - says that they have never gotten an invite, even though they've checked their spam filter.\n\nThen again, Amy Goodman, co-host of lefty mainstay \"Democracy Now!,\" did not respond to a request for comment. Suspicious!\n\nWhat can we say about this?\n\nCynics might tell you that Zuckerberg, the fifth-richest person on Earth and head of a giant international conglomerate, is largely sympathetic to the corporate right. According to a Bloomberg News analysis, the 2017 GOP tax bill saved Facebook $8.3 billion in just one year.\n\nThe same cynics might mention that Facebook's first outside investor was Peter Thiel, who now serves on the company's board - and is one of just two members of its compensation and governance committee. Thiel, an outspoken supporter of President Donald Trump, secretly funded a lawsuit that destroyed the news outlet Gawker.\n\nThese cynical cynics would point out that, despite constant accusations from the right-wing media that Facebook \"silences\" conservatives, the right-wing media is wildly popular on Facebook. They'd say this is no surprise, since Facebook's vice president for U.S. public policy is Joel Kaplan, a former aide to George W. Bush and current member of the board of Bush's presidential museum. According to the Wall Street Journal, Kaplan has \"wielded his influence to postpone or kill projects that risk upsetting conservatives.\"\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members.

They're pretty busy; it's easy to see how that would happen.\n\nAnother plausible explanation is that Mark accidentally sent his invitations to different people with the same names. E.g., he may have been relentlessly dining with and learning from Katrina vanden Heuvel of Tempe, Arizona.\n\nThe only alternative is to believe, as Naureckas says, that large media corporations like Facebook hate being attacked from the left, but \"do not mind being attacked from the right, because the right is fundamentally in favor of the kind of corporate power they represent.\" It would also mean believing that Zuckerberg, one of the most powerful people on this planet, is an absolutely shameless liar .\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "The FBI Has a Long History of Treating Political Dissent as Terrorism\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA new report documents the FBI's history of violating the civil rights of political dissidents.\n\nWhile terrorism in the U.S. is relatively rare, over the last decade most politically motivated violence has come at the hands of far-right extremists. Despite that reality, the FBI has devoted disproportionate resources to the surveillance of nonviolent civil society groups and protest movements, particularly on the left, using its mandate to protect national security to target scores of individuals posing no threat but opposing government policies and practices.\n\nSince 2010, the FBI has surveilled black activists and Muslim Americans, Palestinian solidarity and peace activists, Abolish ICE protesters, Occupy Wall Street, environmentalists, Cuba and Iran normalization proponents, and protesters at the Republican National Convention. And that is just the surveillance we know of - as the civil liberties group Defending Rights & Dissent documents in a report published today. The report is a detailed catalog of known FBI First Amendment abuses and political surveillance since 2010, when the Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General published the last official review of Bush-era abuses. The incidents the report references, many of which were previously covered by The Intercept, were largely exposed through public records requests by journalists, activists, and civil rights advocates. The FBI relentlessly fought those disclosures, and the documents we have were often so heavily redacted they only revealed the existence of initiatives like a \" Race Paper \" or an \" Iron Fist \" operation, both targeting racial justice activists, while giving away little detail about their content.\n\nBut the targeting of political dissent is nothing new for the FBI. In fact, one of the bureau's first campaigns, which began a hundred years ago next month, was an abusive crackdown of politically active immigrants it viewed as disloyal potential terrorists.\n\nOn the second anniversary of Russia's Bolshevik Revolution, law enforcement agents at the direction of the U.S. Department of Justice's Bureau of Investigation - the FBI's precursor - raided the Russian People's House in New York City, where immigrants gathered to take classes, and beat and arrested everyone they found there. In the months following, local and federal police across major U.S. cities rounded up thousands of men and women, mostly foreign-born, who they accused of being subversives and Communists. The raids followed politically motivated investigations into immigrant associations, labor organizing groups, and leftist and anarchist circles.\n\nAttorney General A. Mitchell Palmer, seen through the window of his home at in Washington, D.C., after it was bombed on June 2, 1919.\n\nThe Palmer Raids, as they came to be known, after Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer, ushered in an era that tested the nation's commitment to the civil liberties enshrined in the Constitution. One hundred years later, the FBI continues to target political dissent with a broad mandate, little oversight, and next to no transparency. The FBI continues to routinely conflate dissent with terrorism, and remains particularly fixated on leftist ideologies. Like the old bureau under Palmer, today's FBI also casts its net around a wide range of civil society and social justice groups as well as racial and religious minorities.\n\n\"What is known is that there is a persistent pattern of monitoring civil society activity,\" the report concludes, calling for strict oversight and reform of the bureau. \"The FBI continuously singles out peace, racial justice, environmental, and economic justice groups for scrutiny. This is consistent with a decades-long pattern of FBI First Amendment abuses and suggests deeply seated political bias.\"\n\nAfter reviewing the report, a spokesperson for the FBI wrote in a statement to The Intercept that every activity the FBI conducts \"must uphold the Constitution and be carried out in accordance with federal laws.\" The spokesperson added that the bureau's investigative activities \"may not be based solely on the exercise of rights guaranteed by the First Amendment\" and that its methods \"are subject to multiple layers of oversight.\" On its website, the bureau calls the Palmer Raids \"certainly not a bright spot for the young Bureau\" but adds that they did allow it to \"gain valuable experience in terrorism investigations and intelligence work and learn important lessons about the need to protect civil liberties and constitutional rights.\"\n\nIn fact, FBI violations of civil liberties and constitutional rights continued to be exposed at different points in the bureau's history - most notably in the aftermath of the civil rights movement and in the post-9/11 years. Yet the bureau's propensity for the policing of political dissent has remained largely unchallenged, the Defending Rights & Dissent report argues. \"In the 100 years since the Palmer Raids,\" asks Chip Gibbons, the report's author, \"how much has changed?\"\n\nPeople who had been arrested in the federal drive against radicals arrive at Ellis Island in New York City, on April 7, 1920.\n\nThe Palmer Raids were launched on November 7, 1919, on the heels of U.S. government panic about the spread of Bolshevism and anarchism in the country's nascent labor movement, and following a series of bombings, including one targeting Palmer's own house. In response, police officers carrying clubs and blackjacks but no arrest warrants stormed apartments and meeting rooms, and rounded up scores of mostly Eastern European and Italian immigrants they accused of being \"leftists\" and \"subversives.\" Over several months, 10,000 people were arrested in a dozen cities, with thousands held in detention and ordered deported. While most deportation orders were ultimately invalidated, more than 500 people were forcibly removed, according to the report.\n\nThe raids swept up hundreds of people with no connection to political movements and failed to yield anyone responsible for the bombings that had justified them. The abuse resulted in the first official efforts to put a check on the powers of the Bureau of Investigation, which had been established in 1908 over Congress's opposition. At the time, legislators had feared the bureau would become a \" secret police force \" used to spy on Americans and infringe on civil liberties, but when Congress adjourned, President Theodore Roosevelt proceeded to set up the bureau anyway. The raids confirmed legislators' fears.\n\n\"It was the first real awakening of a civil liberties consciousness in the country,\" said Christopher Finan, author of a book on the Palmer Raids . \"Because even though we had had the First Amendment for more than 100 years at that point, and we were philosophically committed to free speech, it hadn't actually been protected. There really were no protections that could be thrown up to protect people when the Red Scare began.\"\n\nWhile groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, founded months after the raids began, have won important First Amendment battles, repeated legislative efforts to limit the powers of the FBI have been short-lived. Decades after the raids, the man who masterminded them - a 24-year-old J. Edgar Hoover - went on to lead COINTELPRO, perhaps the FBI's most infamous political policing operation. The revelation that the FBI had engaged in covert efforts to infiltrate, discredit, and sabotage the anti-war and civil rights movements of the 1960s led to a Senate investigation, a moment of national reckoning, and reforms aimed at protecting First Amendment rights from government overreach.\n\n\"Unfortunately, after 9/11 those protections were removed and so the abuse that we had was not only predictable, but predicted,\" said Mike German, a former FBI agent and outspoken critic of the agency. \"It's easy for a government that is focused on addressing national security threats to quickly begin to view any threat to that government's hold of power as a security threat, rather than a political threat.\"\n\nOccupy Wall Street demonstrators stage a protest in Manhattan, New York, on Oct. 3, 2011.\n\nIn the years after 9/11, civil rights organizations have repeatedly raised the alarm about intrusive and illegal FBI targeting of Muslim Americans. The public outcry eventually led to a review by the DOJ's inspector general, which confirmed that FBI investigations had violated guidelines, though it fell short of finding that the bureau had been acting out of political bias.\n\nAs the Defending Rights & Dissent report notes, just days after the inspector general published its 2010 report on FBI abuses in the Bush era, agents raided the Minneapolis-based Anti-War Committee and the homes of peace activists across the Midwest. The raids followed a yearslong infiltration by an undercover agent who failed to find any plans by the activists to carry out violence and so proceeded to come up with one herself. A year later, the FBI began surveilling Occupy activists before the first protester even arrived at Zuccotti Park, using its counterterrorism authorities to investigate an economic justice movement it claimed might become \"an outlet for a lone offender.\" The FBI also worked with Walmart when the company learned Occupy members might join activists pushing for better working conditions through the OUR Walmart campaign, and it surveilled Occupy Chicago and infiltrated Occupy Cleveland. More recently, the FBI has monitored the Occupy/Abolish ICE movement, including by pressuring an activist and DACA recipient to inform on fellow protesters in exchange for help with his immigration case. The activist refused, and he eventually chose to leave the country voluntarily to avoid deportation.\n\nRed Fawn Fallis stands outside the federal courthouse in Bismarck, N.D., on Dec. 8, 2017. Photo: Tom Stromme/The Bismarck Tribune via AP FBI agents and informants were a regular presence at the 2016 Standing Rock protests against the Dakota Access pipeline, and the activist facing the longest prison sentence in connection to the protests, Red Fawn Fallis , was convicted of firing a gun that was registered to a confidential FBI informant with whom she had been romantically involved. Beyond Standing Rock, the FBI also continued its decadeslong effort to surveil environmental groups, tracking individuals associated with the Tar Sands Brigade, the Break Free from Fossil Fuel campaign, the anti-Keystone protest groups, and the group Rising Tide.\n\nRed Fawn Fallis stands outside the federal courthouse in Bismarck, N.D., on Dec. 8, 2017.\n\nOver the last decade, the FBI also continued targeting Muslim Americans by attempting to coerce individuals who had been placed on the no-fly list into becoming informants and by monitoring the email accounts of prominent Muslim American leaders. In 2011, the FBI led the establishment of the deeply controversial Countering Violent Extremism Task Force , which civil rights advocates denounced as a thinly veiled attempt to enlist social workers, teachers, and community leaders into spying on their own communities. In other instances, FBI agents approached activists with Palestinian solidarity groups and questioned university students about their support for Palestine.\n\nAgents also surveilled activists against police violence following protests in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, tracking their interstate movements and at some point warning that Islamic State group supporters were \"urging\" Ferguson protesters to join them. In 2017, documents leaked to Foreign Policy revealed the FBI had invented a nonexistent ideology, \" Black Identity Extremism ,\" which it claimed was born \"in response to perceived racism and injustice in American society.\"\n\nAs The Intercept has reported, the only successful prosecution of individuals the FBI retroactively described as \"Black Identity Extremists\" - a category the bureau now claims to have dropped - came on the heels of the Ferguson protests. On that occasion, FBI informants recruited two young protesters into a plot to bomb multiple targets, providing them with both the plot and the fake bombs. As the Defending Rights & Dissent report notes, sting operations and the use of informants and agents provocateurs have become a staple of FBI operations in part because the courts have been \"unwilling to find that their actions meet the legal definition of entrapment.\"\n\n\"The FBI has embraced this flawed theory of radicalization, that it's the ideas that are a problem, not the violence,\" noted German, who recently published a book about the FBI's post-9/11 years. \"But also they have embraced a very aggressive sting operation protocol, no longer targeting people who are engaged in violence or illegal acts, but rather finding people who have ideas they don't like, and then encouraging them to commit violent acts, and provide weapons to them to accomplish those acts, only to then arrest them.\"\n\nDemonstrators raise their arms and chant, \"Hands up, don't shoot,\" as police clear them from the street during a protest of the shooting death of Michael Brown on Aug. 17, 2014, in Ferguson, Mo.\n\nTo this day, the FBI lacks a statutory charter clearly outlining the bureau's authority and its limits. Instead, the FBI's powers and jurisdiction are set by the executive branch in the form of guidelines issued by the attorney general. These guidelines, technically subject to change under each DOJ administration, have been repeatedly relaxed through the bureau's history. The current guidelines, set under former Attorney General Michael Mukasey in 2008, give the FBI authority to conduct both \"predicated investigations,\" based on factual evidence of crimes or threats to national security, and \" assessments ,\" which require no such factual basis.\n\nThe standards for opening an assessment are extraordinarily low, the Defending Rights & Dissent report notes. Yet the FBI is allowed extremely intrusive investigative techniques in performing them, including physical surveillance, the use of informants, and pretextual interviews during which agents can misstate the purpose of the interview in order to elicit incriminating statements and even conceal their status as federal officials.\n\nAlso leading to abuse is the FBI's reliance on a network of more than 175 \"Joint Terrorism Task Forces\" that bring together agents with members from hundreds of state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies. Because JTTFs, as they are called in national security lingo, are run by the FBI, they operate under FBI guidelines, which provide fewer protections for speech, privacy, and civil liberties than the rules governing local police and other law enforcement. While local pushback has so far led two cities - San Francisco and Portland, Oregon - to leave their task forces, JTTFs remain a key tool for the policing of dissent. \"The FBI's ability to do harm is somewhat held in check just by its small size,\" said German. \"But when it engages in partnerships with state and local law enforcement, that exponentially increases the size of the FBI.\"\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members.

      "text": "Nonvoters Are Not Privileged. They Are Disproportionately Lower-Income, Nonwhite, and Dissatisfied With the Two Parties.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe media and political class's depiction of abstention as a byproduct of class and racial privilege is a lie.\n\nNot even 24 hours have elapsed since Bernie Sanders announced that he was suspending his presidential run , and already a shaming campaign has been launched against those who are contemplating abstaining from voting due to dissatisfaction with the two major party candidates. The premise invoked for this tactic is that only those who are sufficiently \"privileged\" have the luxury of choosing not to vote - meaning that nonvoters are rich and white and thus largely immune from the harmful consequences of a Trump presidency, which largely fall on the backs of poorer and nonwhite Americans.\n\nThis tactic rests on a caricature: It is designed to suggest that the only people who make a deliberate and conscious choice not to vote due to dissatisfaction are white trust fund leftists whose wealth, status, and privilege immunize them from the consequences of abstention. By contrast, this \"You Must Vote\" campaign insists, those who lack such luxuries - poorer voters and racial minorities - understand that voting is imperative.\n\nThis assertion about the identity and motives of nonvoters is critical not only to try to bully and coerce people into voting by associating nonvoting with rich, white privilege, but also to suppress any recognition of how widespread the dissatisfaction is for both parties and the political system generally among poor and nonwhite citizens.\n\nBut the problem with this claim is a rather significant one: It is based on the outright, demonstrable falsehood that those who choose not to vote are primarily rich, white, and thus privileged, while those who lack those privileges - voters of color and poorer voters - are unwilling to abstain. This is something one can believe only if one's views of the country and its electorate are shaped by social media and cable news bubbles.\n\nThe truth is exactly the opposite. Those who choose not to vote because of dissatisfaction with the choices offered are disproportionately poorer and nonwhite, while rich white people vote in far larger percentages. And the data also makes clear that the primary motive for nonvoting among those demographic groups is not voter suppression but a belief that election outcomes do not matter because both parties are corrupt or interested only in the lives of the wealthy.\n\nThus, those who try to demean, malign and shame nonvoters are largely attacking poorer voters and voters of color, not the New York and California leftist trust-funders of their imagination.\n\nOne of the most comprehensive surveys of nonvoters was published by Pew Research Center on August 9, 2018. It summarized its bottom-line finding this way, the exact opposite of what is typically claimed by wealthy television media stars and D.C. operatives: \"Nonvoters were more likely to be younger, less educated, less affluent and nonwhite.\"\n\nThe Pew data on this issue is stark. Almost half of nonvoters in the 2016 presidential election were nonwhite, even though they compose only one-fourth of the voting population. Even more extreme is the data on class: More than half of nonvoters - 56% - are quite poor, making less than $30,000, even though that income group constitutes just over one-fourth of the voting population. The people who choose to vote are disproportionately privileged; those who are nonprivileged choose disproportionately not to vote.\n\nAs the Washington Post's summary of that survey put it: \"Pew's data shows that almost half of the nonvoters were nonwhite and two-thirds were under age 50. More than half of those who didn't vote earned less than $30,000 a year; more than half of those who did vote were over age 50.\"\n\nThose who choose not to vote - either those who are registered but do not vote or those who simply do not register - constitute a huge number of Americans. Indeed, the Post highlighted their size this way: \"about 30 percent of Americans were eligible to vote but decided not to, a higher percentage than the portion of the country who voted for either Trump or his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.\" And while rich white people chose to vote in large numbers in the 2016 presidential election, lower-income citizens and racial minorities composed a much larger portion of those who chose not to vote:\n\nIn November, New York Times data journalist Nate Cohn, analyzing data from a New York Times/Siena College survey of nonvoters in battleground states who abstained from voting both in 2016 and 2018, similarly described them as \"disproportionately young, nonwhite and low-income,\" adding that \"nonvoters are less likely to have graduated from a four-year college.\" In a separate article last July, Cohn noted that \"young and nonwhite and low-income voters are overrepresented among nonvoters,\" and \"young and nonwhite voters continued to vote at lower rates than older and white voters.\"\n\nThis was true not only for the 2016 election but also the 2018 mid-term election, by which time Trump had been president for almost two full years. As Cohn reported, \"young and nonwhite turnout was markedly higher than it had been in 2014, but still lower than that of older and white voters.\"\n\nPew found that \"in the U.S., roughly six-in-ten adults are registered to vote.\" Of them, \"four-in-ten Americans who were eligible to vote did not do so in 2016 .\" That means 40% of eligible voters in 2016 were nonvoters. The sheer number alone - millions of Americans - should preclude any claim that nonvoters are rich, white, and privileged people.\n\n[Even the voting preferences of the electorate are radically distorted by online \"privilege\" discourse: Aside from the fact that 28 percent of Hispanic people and 14 percent of black men voted for Trump in 2016 , rich white people voted for the Democratic candidate, not the GOP candidate, while poorer white people voted for Trump: \"whites with a four-year college degree or more education made up 30% of all validated voters. Among these voters, far more (55%) said they voted for Clinton than for Trump (38%). Among the much larger group of white voters who had not completed college (44% of all voters), Trump won by more than two-to-one (64% to 28%).\"]\n\nTo deny agency to poorer and nonwhite nonvoters, it is sometimes claimed that voter suppression efforts - rather than a cognizant and rational choice - is the primary factor explaining the behavior of poor and nonwhite nonvoters. That is also false.\n\nA separate Pew survey , in 2017, of people who are not registered to vote found exactly the opposite: that people who refrain from participating in the electoral process largely do so because they are dissatisfied with the choices or believe voting will not change their lives. As Pew put it: \"The unregistered were more likely to say they do not vote because they dislike politics or believe voting will not make a difference, while people who are registered but vote infrequently say they do not vote more often because they are not informed enough about the candidates or issues.\"\n\nIndeed, that Pew survey of unregistered voters found that the most common cause for not registering is that they do not want to vote , and the most common reasons have nothing to do with voter suppression and everything to do with beliefs about the worthlessness of the elections. As Pew put it, \"forty-four percent of eligible unregistered individuals say they do not want to vote,\" while \"25 percent say they are unregistered because they have not been inspired by a candidate or issue.\"\n\nAnd, Pew emphasized, both unregistered voters as well as registered voters who choose not to vote broadly express dissatisfaction with, or indifference toward, the two major parties and election outcomes as their motives: \"The unregistered are more likely to indicate a broad distaste for the electoral system than registered individuals, who tend to give election-specific motives for nonvoting, such as disliking the candidates or not knowing enough about the issues.\"\n\nThe Huffington Post, based on Pew data of people who chose not to vote in the 2018 midterm election, described the primary motive for abstention this way: \"many Americans who didn't vote in this year's midterm elections say they opted out due to a dislike of politics or a feeling their vote wouldn't matter.\" And nonvoters, it noted, also \" tend to skew younger, poorer and less white than those who do turn out.\"\n\nAll of this data demonstrates that, while GOP voter suppression efforts are both real and pernicious, nonvoting is overwhelmingly a choice. Indeed, the Pew survey of midterm voters and nonvoters concluded that, while minority voters disgracefully experience longer lines than white voters, \"about three-quarters of self-reported voters (76%) say it was 'very easy' for them to vote in the November elections. Another 16% say voting was 'somewhat easy.'\"\n\nWhile voter suppression is unquestionably a serious stain on U.S. political life that does (by design) impede voting, the overwhelming reason people stay home is due to cynicism toward or dissatisfaction with the political process and the choices they were presented. As the Huffington Post explained about the 2018 midterm elections, \"as a group, nonvoters also tend to be generally disengaged from public affairs and cynical about the government and their own roles in civic life. Nearly half of nonvoters in the most recent election said their personal dislike of politics played at least a minor role in their decision not to vote.\" The Pew chart highlights how widespread is this belief among nonvoters:\n\nNonvoters, despite their large numbers, are rarely discussed in mainstream U.S. precincts. In part that is because national media figures in cable news and Washington are overwhelmingly affluent and have little connection to or interest in them.\n\nBut in large part, that omission is explained by the fact that interrogating why so many millions of Americans choose not to vote would force the political and media class to grapple with the reason for this choice: Namely, the widespread perception that the political process and the two major parties are fundamentally corrupted and indifferent to all but a small sliver of privileged people. Confronting that problem and being forced to address it is far more difficult than creating a pleasant fiction that falsely maintains that people who abstain from voting do so because of selfish, amoral racial and class privilege.\n\nIn those few instances when nonvoters are honestly examined by large media outlets, a much different picture emerges than the one typically disseminated by affluent media stars and D.C. political operatives. One of the best and most thoughtful articles was a New York Times survey of African Americans in Milwaukee who chose not to vote in the 2016 election and, even knowing that it helped Trump win Wisconsin and thus the presidency, did not regret it.\n\nThe Times explained that \"the [2016] election was notable as much for the people who did not show up, as for those who did. Nationally, about half of eligible voters did not cast ballots.\" Wisconsin had its lowest turnout in 16 years. The Times added:\n\nMilwaukee's lowest-income neighborhoods offer one explanation for the turnout figures. Of the city's 15 council districts , the decline in turnout from 2012 to 2016 in the five poorest was consistently much greater than the drop seen in more prosperous areas - accounting for half of the overall decline in turnout citywide.\n\nThe interviews the paper conducted with African Americans and other poor residents of Milwaukee who chose not to vote were illuminating. They overwhelmingly said they did not regret their choice, even knowing Trump won, because they do not believe that the outcome of elections improves their lives, and do not believe that a victory by the Democratic Party would be meaningful for them. One Milwaukee barber, Cedric Fleming, said in a quote that was representative of the survey: \"I don't feel bad. Milwaukee is tired. Both of them [Clinton and Trump] were terrible. They never do anything for us anyway.\"\n\nThe Times quoted another Milwaukee barber as follows:\n\n\"I'm so numb,\" said Jahn Toney, 45, who had written in Mr. Sanders. He said no president in his lifetime had done anything to improve the lives of black people, including Mr. Obama, whom he voted for twice. \"It's like I should have known this would happen. We're worse off than before.\"\n\nThat rationale for nonvoting - \"both of them were terrible. They never do anything for us anyway\" - is typically cast by media personalities and Washington operatives as the province of rich, white, privileged leftists. But that claim is a lie. The data makes overwhelmingly clear that those who make that choice are often those with the least amount of privilege who believe, with good reason, that both parties and the political process generally are constructed to have no interest in improving their lives.\n\nIt is crucial to understand who nonvoters are, and what their motives are for choosing to abstain, not only to prevent media figures and D.C. operatives from disseminating disinformation, but also because that understanding highlights what kinds of candidates can motivate the millions of nonvoters to go to the polls. As the New York Times' Nate Cohn explained, the candidates most closely associated with the status quo are ones most likely to drive voters away from the polls, while those who appear to be outsiders who intend to deviate from bipartisan consensus are most likely to motivate them. That's why Sanders, in 2019, had the greatest appeal among nonvoters when he was perceived as something other than a traditional Democrat:\n\nWhen it comes to the candidates, Mr. Sanders shows relative strength among nonvoters: He has a 41 percent \"very favorable\" rating in the group, compared with 33 percent for Mr. Biden and 30 percent for Ms. Warren. This is at least in part because of Mr. Sanders's longtime appeal to young voters.\n\nNot only is Mr. Sanders's favorability rating the best of these three candidates, but he is also the only Democrat whose favorability rating is stronger among nonvoting Democratic leaners than among those who have voted before. His outsider status and promise of fundamental change, without much focus on cultural issues, might offer at least one clue for how Democrats might appeal to these nonvoters, though it need not be the only one.\n\nPolling already indicates that Joe Biden faces a serious problem whereby even his supporters - to say nothing of nonvoters - have extremely low enthusiasm for his candidacy . He could certainly win, but it will not be because he motivates large numbers of nonvoters to go the polls.\n\nWhatever else is true, those who make the choice to abstain from voting in presidential and midterm elections are overwhelmingly anything but \"privileged.\" The claim that they are is deliberate disinformation spread by the political and media elite class to suppress the reality of their own systemic failures when it comes to serving the needs of the vast majority of the population and to try to shame, rather than persuade, disaffected people to vote for their candidate.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Nancy Pelosi Has Chosen Her War, and It's With Her Own Party's Future\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nIt is time for liberals and leftists who lambast Mitch McConnell to admit to themselves that the hippie-punching Pelosi has become a Trump enabler too.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi answers questions during her weekly press conference at the U.S. Capitol on June 27, 2019, in Washington, D.C.\n\nThey call themselves the \" Squad .\" From climate change to student debt to migrants in detention , progressive House Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and Ayanna Pressley have been energetic and outspoken since getting elected last November - and, as a result, have become inured to constant attacks from congressional Republicans and, of course, Fox News .\n\nBut how about from their own boss?\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times' Maureen Dowd, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dismissed the Squad as \"four people\" who have their \"public whatever and their Twitter world\" but don't \"have any following.\"\n\nOuch. This isn't the first time Pelosi has trolled the left-wing quartet. In April, when she was asked by Lesley Stahl on \"60 Minutes\" to comment on the newly emboldened progressive wing of her party, Pelosi responded : \"That's like five people.\"\n\nRead our Complete Coverage All the President's Crimes\n\nRead our Complete Coverage\n\nIn the wake of November's midterms, Pelosi mocked calls from AOC and her allies for a Green New Deal: \"The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they're for it right?\"\n\nTo be clear: None of these freshmen Democrats have personally attacked Pelosi, and all four of them backed her bid for the speakership. As CNN's Nathan McDermott tweeted , \"It is pretty notable that the most vocally anti-Pelosi Democrats (ala the moderates in swing districts who opposed her leadership) don't get as much criticism from her as the left-wing of the party.\"\n\nHow about Donald Trump? Pelosi is willing to criticize Trump - \"I've never encountered, thought about, seen within the realm of my experiences as a child or an adult, anybody like this\" - but only criticize. Nothing more. Not impeachment, that's for sure. The top Democrat in the House told Dowd that the president has engaged in criminal behavior but - wait for it - \"you can't impeach everybody.\"\n\nThe New York Times interview is yet another reminder for liberals and leftists that if they want to oppose Trump, they have to oppose Pelosi too.\n\nThink I'm exaggerating? Consider three recent - and shameful - episodes.\n\nFirst, the rape allegations against the president. On June 21, New York magazine published a cover story from the famed advice columnist and writer E. Jean Carroll, in which she documented in excruciating detail how Trump, back in the mid-1990s, forced \"his penis halfway\" inside of her in the midst of a \"colossal struggle\" in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room.\n\nPelosi's response to a reporter who asked her for comment a whole six days later? \"I don't know the person making the accusation ... I haven't paid that much attention to it.\"\n\nHere's Nancy Pelosi verbally shrugging in response to a question about what she thinks Congress should do about a credible rape accusation against the president. Not great. pic.twitter.com/NPoEUB3jgg\n\n- Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) June 27, 2019\n\nNow, she tells Dowd: \"I respect the case she has but I don't see any role for Congress.\"\n\nThe sitting Republican president has been credibly accused of having committed a sexual assault and yet Congress, says the Democratic speaker of the House, has no \"role\" in holding him to account for it. Oh, and the speaker herself hasn't been paying \"attention to it.\"\n\nThis, my dear liberals, is your (feminist) champion.\n\nSecond, the crisis at the border. One of the reasons Pelosi cited for not being familiar with the E. Jean Carroll story was that she was \"busy worrying about children not being in their mothers' arms.\" Yet on that same day, as the New York Times reported, Pelosi \"capitulated to Republicans and Democratic moderates and dropped her insistence on stronger protections for migrant children in overcrowded border shelters\" by signing onto a bill from the Republican-led Senate, giving the Trump administration $4.6 billion to tackle the situation on the southern border.\n\nLast time I checked, though, this administration's horrific decision to separate migrant children from their parents had nothing to do with a lack of funds. \"The cruelty is the point,\" as the Atlantic's Adam Serwer so memorably put it. Plus, 18 so-called \"centrist\" Democrats pushed Pelosi into dropping her objections to the Senate bill and yet in her New York Times interview, the speaker decided to level her attack on - you guessed it - the Squad. They made themselves irrelevant and shouldn't have voted against \"our bill,\" she told Dowd, adding: \"They're four people and that's how many votes they got.\"\n\nYet they were far from alone in opposing Pelosi's decision. \"The final vote, 305 to 102,\" reported the Times on June 27, \"included far more Republicans in favor, 176, than Democrats, 129.\"\n\nMeanwhile, over at the border, children continue to be starved , women continue to drink out of toilet bowls , and men continue to be held in standing-room-only conditions. The Trump administration is now contemplating mass video proceedings for immigrants seeking asylum.\n\nThank you, Madam Speaker.\n\nI don't believe it was a good idea for Dems to blindly trust the Trump admin when so many kids have died in their custody. It's a huge mistake.\n\nThis admin also refuses to hand over docs to Congress on the whereabouts of families. People's lives are getting bargained, & for what? https://t.co/h7gP8Wous1\n\n- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) July 7, 2019\n\nThird, Trump's tax returns. Last Tuesday, almost exactly six months after Democrats won control of the House, they finally took the president of the United States to court to try to force disclosure of his financial records. Trump administration officials and Trump's army of personal lawyers have offered a range of excuses for refusing to release these records - and for defying congressional subpoenas in the process. But as Slate's Mark Joseph Stern has noted , one in particular stands out from the rest.\n\nOn June 10, in an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Trump's lawyers contested the claim that the House's impeachment power could justify subpoenaing the president's financial records while gleefully pointing out to the judge that impeachment is not even on the table. They wrote in their brief :\n\nSpeaker Pelosi has steadfastly denied that the House's investigations are in any way related to impeachment. In March, she unequivocally told the Washington Post, 'I'm not for impeachment.' In late May, the Speaker reiterated that 'any suggestion that Democrats are planning to pursue impeachment 'simply isn't the truth.'\" After she received the district court's ruling in this case, the Speaker boasted that the Committee had prevailed despite \"the fact the House Democratic caucus is not on a path to impeachment.\" Just four days ago, the Speaker again told senior Democratic leaders that \"she isn't open to the idea\" of impeachment, and Chairman Cummings \"sided with Pelosi.\"\n\nIs it not a source of shame for rank-and-file Democrats, whether on the left or in the \"center,\" that Trump lawyers are citing Pelosi's refusal to impeach him as their defense in court? As their justification for ignoring congressional subpoenas?\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nMeanwhile, Pelosi herself continues to duck and dodge the arguments in favor of impeachment - even when she happens to be the one making them. \"The thing is that, he every day practically self-impeaches by obstructing justice and ignoring the subpoenas,\" she told the Times.\n\nSorry, what is she on about? I may not be a U.S. citizen yet, or speaker of the House of Representatives for that matter, but I have read the U.S. Constitution from beginning to end, and I have yet to come across the clause that refers to \"self-impeachment.\"\n\nSo forget the \"you-go-girl memes for literally clapping back at Trump\" that Dowd fawns over in her interview with the speaker. It is time for liberals and leftists who lambast Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to admit to themselves that the hippie-punching Pelosi has become a Trump enabler too.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

Wade in Washington, D.C., on July 19, 2022.\n\nWhen 2022 is tallied in the annals of history, it will no doubt be remembered as the year the Supreme Court ended the constitutional right to an abortion. Yet, while the decadeslong right-wing assault on reproductive liberties reached new heights this year, it also met a broad wave of long overdue resistance, even in crimson red states. The midterm election results were in many ways a popular rebuke to the Republican pro-natalist agenda - cold comfort as that might be in a country of minority rule.\n\nThe crucial struggle for abortion access is, however, a response to only one front in the far right's all-out war on bodily autonomy and reproductive freedom. In statehouses nationwide, Republicans consistently put forward extreme anti-abortion bills at the very same time that they have proposed bills to attack, immiserate, and eliminate trans people, particularly trans children.\n\nThe GOP has made clear that its anti-abortion efforts go hand in hand with an anti-trans eliminationist project; they are two sides of the same coin. The mass efforts to defend abortion access, however, have not been echoed in the fight for trans lives.\n\nRather, 2022 has seen right-wing attacks on trans rights increasingly aided by the tacit, if sometimes unwitting, transphobia of liberal political and media institutions - consider the numerous New York Times reports and columns, for example, that have this year put trans lives up for debate.

Looking across the Atlantic, to my birth country, I had felt a certain relief that in the mainstream U.S. discourse, anti-trans rhetoric was, for the most part, understood to be a mark of the far right.\n\nThis year anti-trans liberal feminism - the sort championed by author J.K. Rowling - has been mainstreamed in the very same opinion pages that once treated the position as an unpleasant British curiosity.\n\nThe far right has, meanwhile, only escalated its anti-trans onslaught, grimly secure in the knowledge that, unlike with abortion, no significant political pushback will come. This is in part thanks to U.S. transphobes who falsely consider themselves in opposition to the far right - like some New York Times columnists - as well as fangless Democrats who treat trans people as an afterthought. Even the anti-fascist left has not done enough to take up the fight for trans rights.\n\nPride flags and candles wave during the Transgender Day of Remembrance in Wilkes-Barre, Penn., on Nov. 20, 2022.\n\nIn 2022 , state lawmakers filed a record number of anti-LGBTQ bills - nearly 300 - with many targeting trans kids in schools. Ten states barred trans students from playing sports , two states barred trans children from accessing the correct bathrooms , and two states banned discussions of sexual orientation or gender identity in schools (which, of course, only means the discussion of non-cisgender identities and non-heteronormative sexual orientations).\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott directed state agencies to investigate parents of trans kids as child abusers, an effort Republicans in other states are looking to advance . In Congress, far-right extremist Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., introduced the first piece of federal legislation, co-sponsored by a whopping 40-plus House Republicans, to outlaw gender-affirming care for minors nationwide. That law would make providing such care a felony punishable by up to 25 years in prison.\n\nThe only thing holding many of these barbaric laws and policies at bay are lawsuits filed by trans children and their families, represented by attorneys like Chase Strangio of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nThe outlook for 2023 remains dark: Republicans will control the U.S. House and state lawmakers - with scant reason to limit their anti-trans eliminationist efforts - will continue apace. Immediately after the midterms, lawmakers in Tennessee filed bills to ban gender-affirming health care for children in next year's state legislative session.\n\nMeanwhile, outside statehouses and courtrooms, the far right has declared open season on LBGTQ spaces. It is now common practice for armed, self-identifying Christian nationalist militia members to harass family-friendly drag brunches and drag queen story hours. When a mass shooting last month at Club Q, an LGBTQ nightclub in Colorado Springs, left five people dead, the national response was one of shock but not surprise. Anti-LGBTQ violence felt all but inevitable.\n\nThe response from the usual liberal bastions wasn't surprising either: There was handwringing about physically defending queer people. A week after the massacre, the New York Times editorial board chose to dedicate column inches to condemning armed anti-fascist groups who have been protecting queer spaces in response to this ongoing wave of armed fascist harassment.\n\nFascist propagandists like the Manhattan Institute's Christopher Rufo - who cynically transformed \"critical race theory\" from a term of scholarly inquiry into a racist foghorn - have spoken publicly about stoking their conservative base with anti-LGBTQ myths of \"groomers\" and pedophiles.\n\nIt's not a secret that the anti-trans panic has been manufactured by think tanks or that anti-trans legislation is drafted from model bills, circulated from the top down, and spewed from Tucker Carlson's furiously contorting mouth into millions of living rooms every evening. There is nothing organic nor grassroots about this anti-trans moral panic, yet it is accorded the status of a legitimate public concern.\n\n\"Rufo is so confident in his disdain\" for liberal establishment media, noted writer Max Fox in a recent essay for Parapraxis, \"that he can be seen telling credulous liberal journalists precisely how he has manipulated them into carrying out his campaign.\"\n\nIt's working: Liberals might not be echoing QAnon \"groomer\" conspiracies, but anti-trans panic abounds, reliably articulated as fear for the fates of children - notional children , who are presumed cis, that is. Time and again, I've heard ostensibly well-meaning liberals regurgitate the same sentences that were used in previous eras to treat gay identity, or interracial couples, as sites of potential peril. The refrain is the same: I support it, but won't children suffer? And the answer should be the same too: Only if we maintain a world wherein such identities and relationships are deemed unnatural and unwanted.\n\nThis is not a question of showing liberal deference to personal identity. It's about who is and is not permitted to produce and reproduce the world as they see fit. When it comes to queer and trans liberation, especially of queer trans people of color, we have this year seen the consequences of treating the recognition of identity as merely an issue of visibility or representation. Without a commitment to our shared liberation, without active solidarity, increased visibility for trans people can just mean greater exposure to risk.\n\nWe will carry the struggle for reproductive freedom into the new year. We must: Republican efforts to decimate reproductive health care have been horrifyingly successful, and they will not stop. Avoiding a red wave in the midterms did not restore abortion rights, let alone the free and accessible abortion and reproductive care we so need.\n\nYet we can't win this fight unless we understand the right's anti-abortion politics for what they are. That means seeing why the struggle for trans rights and reproductive justice must go together. For the most part, beyond a highly religious minority, those who are anti-abortion are not driven by a true belief in the inviolable value of all fetal life; Republicans would have and pay for fewer abortions themselves if that were true, and they would arguably care more about the lives of poor, Black pregnant women.\n\nInstead, when Republicans invoke the child who needs saving from abortion, they refer to a political construction, a figuration: the \"innocent\" white, cis child at the heart of the Republican political imaginary, reproduced within the confines of the private nuclear family. It's this organization of white standing and property that anti-abortion politics aim to uphold.\n\nIt's not an accident, then, that Republicans call upon the same myth of imperiled children to warn of trans indoctrination, grooming, or \"social contagion\" - with the very same notions of \"purity\" and traditionalist family reproduction at play.\n\nFascism holds this imaginary \"innocent\" child at its rhetorical center - and when it comes to abortion politics, liberals and leftists have rejected its invocation, insisting instead on prioritizing the health and well-being of actually living adults and children and their rights to bodily autonomy.\n\nIn the struggle for trans rights, all too many liberals - and some leftists - have interpellated notions about pure and innocent children who must be somehow protected from transness. That is, they have let fascism's child win the day. Vanquishing the right's pro-natalist fascism requires standing with trans children.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

From my childhood in the 1940s and '50s through the upheavals of the '60s, I only told them one thing: take a hike.\n\nFBI specialists at work in the Bureau's Fingerprint Identification Division, ca. 1930-50. (Corbis via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nFor many years, I had a recurring dream of being chased by the FBI. What the hell could that have been about?\n\nDuring my childhood in the late 1940s and early '50s, with the Cold War at its peak, the FBI's infallibility was unquestionable. We knew this because a host of movies and television shows - I Led 3 Lives , I Was a Communist for the FBI , The Red Menace , I Married a Communist , My Son John , and more - boosted the feds to heroic proportions.\n\nThe several-thousand-page file that J. Edgar Hoover and his minions built on me starts when I was thirteen years old. The bureau starts such files early for red-diaper babies. But my memories of being identified as a \"Red\" began in 1948 when I, age eight, was helping my dad distribute flyers for the Independent Progressive presidential campaign of Henry Wallace, who had been agriculture secretary and vice president under Franklin D. Roosevelt. One unwilling recipient of the leaflet chased me down the block, calling me \"a filthy Red.\" I had to ask my parents later what exactly that meant.\n\nIt wasn't the last time I needed help with my vocabulary. One day when I was ten years old, I was home alone. The phone rang and when I picked it up, I was told that the caller was \"Honey\" from \"the Ramparts Street brothel.\" Would I kindly give a message to my folks: my dad was \"behind on his bill.\" I said I surely would pass along the message. After hanging up, I went to the dictionary to find out what a \"brothel\" was. My father died more than fifty years later, my mom more than seventy, never having gotten the message, which most likely came from an FBI agent.\n\nNeither that call, nor any of the FBI visits to our home - and even to my junior high school where an agent tried to interview me in the principal's office - were ever recorded in my file. But they've always stuck with me and helped me make the choices I've made in life. As Bob Hope used to sing, \"Thanks for the memories, how lovely it was.\"\n\nSo many memories, no small number involving the FBI. During my undergraduate days at UC Berkeley sixty-plus years ago, we had a left-leaning student political party, SLATE, that led protests against racist housing practices, capital punishment, and the Pentagon's on-campus Reserved Officers Training Corps; and in support of farmworkers' organizing, the Southern civil rights revolution, free speech on campus, and such.\n\nWhen I first came to the university in the fall of 1958, the Cold War was still hot, and the school had done its part early on in administering loyalty oaths to faculty and firing any deemed insufficiently subservient to the masters of war. It was considered a radical act to hand out leaflets at the campus gates. SLATE was in large part a reaction to that and perhaps the first break with the Cold War consensus imposed on campus life across the country.\n\nNot everyone was pleased, certainly not the university administration. We had many noncampus detractors as well. The John Birch Society, grandpappy of today's US fascist movements, regularly denounced us. My favorite professor, Richard Drinnon, a US history specialist - he wrote the definitive biography of Emma Goldman and several volumes on the genocide of America's indigenous peoples - and faculty advisor to SLATE, was a particular target. Literally.\n\nDick's office was a couple doors away from that of Tom Parkinson, a poet and W. B. Yeats scholar. One day, a deranged former student, influenced by the Birch Society, came onto campus armed with a shotgun hoping to kill Drinnon. But Dick's office was locked, and the gunman found Parkinson's open. The man wanted to \"get someone who was associated with Communism.\" He blew away part of Parkinson's face (he survived) and killed a teaching assistant who was in the office.\n\nI mention this incident to call attention to the FBI's priorities. Only a week before, Dick told me the following story. A man, a stranger, comes to visit him in his office. Dressed in a typical black suit, a white dress shirt and tie, and leather shoes, Dick immediately knew who the visitor was. He identified himself as a \"special agent\" of the FBI and had a few questions to ask about one of Dick's students. That would be me.\n\nDick asked him how he knew the guy was really an agent. Did he have some identification? The man showed his badge and ID. Dick said that anyone can buy a badge and fake ID. Could he provide him the name and phone number of his supervisor at the FBI field office? The man gave him a name and number, and Dick dials the phone.\n\nWhen he connected to the supervisor, he said, \"Hello, My name is Richard Drinnon. I'm a professor at Berkeley and I have a man in my office who purports to be one of your agents.\" He gave the guy on the other end a description of his office visitor and asks if he can confirm that the man is indeed an agent. The guy gave the requested confirmation.\n\nDick thanked him, hung up, returned the badge and ID to his visitor and said, \"You are who you say you are. Sorry, I don't talk to FBI agents.\"\n\nA couple years later, I graduated. It's a brutal winter in 1961-62, and I'm twenty-one years old, recently moved to New York to head up organizing the US contingent to the World Youth Festival, to be held that summer in Helsinki. Eventually, four hundred fifty of us Americans would go - a pretty diverse collection of young folks from nearly every state, with a wide variety of mainly progressive politics (and of no politics). Among the participants were Archie Shepp, Bill Dixon, and Perry Robinson, who would shortly after become jazz luminaries. The not-yet-published-and-famous Alice Walker was also part of the contingent. Another was eighteen-year-old Angela Davis , a Brandeis University freshman. There were assorted New Leftists, liberals, Young Democrats, socialists, and communists.\n\nOne morning, I'm sitting in my two-room, ninth-floor office in a nondescript building on Park Avenue South and East 28th Street. The phone rings. It's an assistant from the Barry Farber Show asking me if I'd like to go on the air with Barry that night.\n\nBack then, he was about the biggest name in radio, at least in New York City, with a huge nightly audience from 10 PM to midnight. I say, sure, I'll come on, why not? I'm told to show up by 9:30 at Barry's studio, located on top of Mama Leone's, a family-style Italian restaurant in the theater district which catered largely to tourists.\n\nI get to the station, am ushered in to meet Barry, and \"his other guest\" who turns out to be Gloria Steinem.\n\nBack then, Gloria was hardly a celebrity. But she ran the Independent Research Service, which was set up to counter my US Festival Committee, to warn unwitting young folk about the dangers of falling into our communist clutches. Turns out the Independent Research Service was underwritten and formed by the Central Intelligence Agency. Gloria later told me she didn't know who was funding her, which was a bit surprising since I knew and since she was the one who worked there.\n\nI had met Gloria before our Barry Farber show appearance, having made a point of asking her to lunch a couple months prior just to see if I could find out what she was up to. Gloria is six years older than I am and at the age of twenty-seven was much cagier than the twenty-one-year-old me. So the lunch was largely a bust. But she was never less than friendly. Guess she probably wanted to know what I was up to, also.\n\nThat evening in the radio studio, Barry spent the fifteen minutes before we went on the air flirting with Gloria and asked her out for drinks after the show. I sat there ignored by the two of them. I could have been a bag of hammers.\n\nSo now it's showtime, the red light above the studio door goes on and we're on the air. Barry introduces Gloria and then tells the listening audience that I'm Michael Myerson, and I am organizing young Americans to attend \"the communist youth festival in eastern Europe,\" meaning Finland.\n\nAfter a few softball questions to Gloria, Barry reached for a folder in front of him, glanced through some papers, and asked if I was \"the same Michael Myerson\" who was arrested in San Francisco's City Hall protesting the House Un-American Activities Committee? A couple more pieces of paper are perused. Didn't I lead SLATE, the student political party that UC Berkeley kicked off campus?\n\nThen a couple more questions for Gloria, and it's time for a commercial break. During the break, a guy walks into the studio on Barry's side, hands him another folder, whispers in his ear, and takes a seat in the back of the studio.\n\nWhen we're on the air again, Barry starts grilling me. What did I think about Stalin? How about Fidel Castro? Did I know that Raul Castro had gone to a World Youth Festival eight years earlier? And so it went.\n\nFinally, when the show's over and we're off the air, a page opens the door to the studio, pokes her head in, and says to the guy in back, \"Phone call for you. Mr Romerstein.\" Herbert Romerstein was the FBI agent in charge of youth activities in the New York metropolitan area.\n\nSeveral years later, I ran into Gloria on a shuttle flight from Washington to La Guardia. By now she was the Gloria Steinem. I reminded her of that evening with Barry. She was greatly embarrassed and hugely apologetic - not only about that evening but about her youthful CIA flirtation.\n\nLike Dick, I also don't talk to FBI agents. The last one I spoke with was \"Honey from the Ramparts Street Brothel\" when I was ten. In the late sixties, a couple agents intercepted me on the street in Greenwich Village and said they'd like to talk to me. I rubbed my nose with my middle finger, told them, \"No thanks,\" and walked by. That was the last time they tried.\n\nMichael Myerson is an author and lifelong activist for civil rights, peace, and labor rights. He lives in the Hudson Valley and is currently at work on a memoir on his life on the Left.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Ignore the lies and distortions - the reality, as the latest research shows, is that scores of socialists influenced or were themselves key figures in the civil rights movement.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr and  Coretta Scott King lead a  voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, in March 1965. (William Lovelace / Daily Express / Hulton Archive / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\n\"The [thing] nobody wants to say . . . or doesn't know to say,\" said Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker, an executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in the mid-1960s, \"is that the people around [Martin Luther King Jr], and Dr. King himself - we were all left-wingers.\"\n\nWalker knew of what he spoke. A member of the Young Communist League in the 1940s, he retained his left-wing politics well into the sixties, commenting in a 1963 TV interview that \"granting to the Negro full emancipation means a readjustment of the entire economy. . . . I think it's an inevitable move toward some kind of socialism.\"\n\nThis image of King and his cohort as committed radicals defies their popular portrayal as \"I Have a Dream\" moderates. But in an important new article drawing on years of painstaking research, scholar Matt Nichter reports that Walker was basically right. The SCLC - the famed group of black ministers, first helmed by King himself - was suffused with \"personnel overlap,\" \"network ties,\" and \"organizational alliances\" with the socialist and communist left of the 1930s and 1940s, often referred to as the Old Left.\n\n\"Red\" unions like the United Packinghouse Workers infused the SCLC coffers with crucial early funding. SCLC leaders cut their teeth in Old Left organizations like the National Negro Congress and the Southern Negro Youth Congress. King's teachers and mentors surrounded him with left-wing ideas as a young man. Together, such figures and institutions embodied a tradition of \" civil rights unionism \" that looked askance at capitalism and viewed mass working-class action and interracial unionism as anti-racist bludgeons.\n\nAs we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom - and as establishment figures push a shallow anti-racism - much of the history and tradition that Nichter chronicles has been forgotten or suppressed. Jacobin 's Shawn Gude spoke with Nichter about the Old Left's deep influence on the civil rights movement, the connection between labor and racial justice struggles, and the tradition of civil rights unionism in a post-George Floyd moment when labor is weak but stirring.\n\nYou note early in the article that the intense redbaiting of the 1950s and 60s led many in SCLC to hide their past leftist affiliations or present radicalism. What was the research like for this project? It seems you were doing lots of detective work, finding scraps of evidence and then piecing them together.\n\nFor starters, I needed to figure out where these folks grew up, where they went to college or seminary - basic biographical information that you'd think would be easy to find, but often isn't for folks who aren't famous. And then I had to figure out which Old Left organizations had a presence in those places. From there, I could try to determine whether these SCLC activists had been involved in the Old Left.\n\nThe evidence I present in the article is drawn from more than thirty archival collections, sixty black and left-wing periodicals, and several dozen oral history interviews. I also looked at lots of government surveillance reports, which obviously couldn't be taken at face value, but which often contained clues that enabled me to track down more reliable forms of evidence.\n\nIt was a slow process. The project was over a decade in the making.\n\nWhat is the conventional story about the role of socialists and leftists in the Civil Rights Movement, and what did you find looking specifically at the SCLC?\n\nAmong the general public, there's not much awareness that the socialist movement of the 1930s, 1940s, and early 1950s helped shape the civil rights movement of the mid-1950s and 1960s. The popular image is of ministers and college students, who are seen as admirable - but communists and socialists, not so much. Though I should qualify by saying that among leftist activists today, there's a growing awareness that the story is more complex, thanks in part to publications like Jacobin .\n\nAmong historians who study African American politics and protest, it's well established that during the 1930s and 1940s the Old Left was absolutely central to various anti-racist campaigns. But historians also know that McCarthyism decimated the Old Left during the late 1940s and early 1950s.\n\nMy research builds on the work of scholars who have shown that many Old Left activists survived the post-World War II red scare, and went on to play important roles in the civil rights movement - people like Bayard Rustin , Ella Baker , Anne Braden , Jack O'Dell , and Stanley Levison . But I think this phenomenon was much more pervasive than scholars have realized.\n\nI found that one-third of SCLC's elected officers in 1961 had Old Left backgrounds, as did half of the executive directors from SCLC's founding through the mid-1960s; half of the program directors during that same period; and roughly two-thirds of the Research Committee, King's informal advisory group during the mid-1960s.\n\nThis article is about SCLC, but I've also done a lot of research on the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Congress of Racial Equity (CORE), and the story is similar. But I focused on SCLC for this piece, because I thought it was in some ways a \"hard case.\"\n\nRight, they're supposed to be these staid ministers.\n\nThere's a myth that the Old Left was strictly secular, but socialist and communist groups collaborated with - and often recruited - religious believers.\n\nAnother common assumption is that the Old Left was overwhelmingly white, which just isn't true.\n\nSo let's talk a bit about the Old Left itself. What were some of the organizations that made up the Old Left, and what was the Old Left's view, in general, about the relationship between class oppression and racial oppression, as well as the best way to fight racial tyranny in the US?\n\nIn the article, I define the Old Left broadly, to include organizations in which socialists and communists of various stripes played central roles. By the 1940s, most Old Left activists had drawn the conclusion that you can't effectively fight the boss, especially in a place like America where racial divisions are so entrenched, unless you are actively fighting racism. So Old Left activists helped launch and lead a panoply of militant anti-racist organizations.\n\nThe article mentions dozens of these organizations, some of them well studied, others more obscure. Among the organizations that cropped up repeatedly in the backgrounds of the SCLC cadre I studied were the National Negro Congress , the Southern Negro Youth Congress , the Southern Conference Educational Fund , the Progressive Party , and various left-led labor unions .\n\nWhat were Martin Luther King Jr's connections to the Old Left?\n\nThe first thing to bear in mind is that King lived through the tail end of the Great Depression as a boy, and saw breadlines all over Atlanta. As a teenager in the mid-1940s, when he attended college, the Old Left was still a powerful force in the United States - this is before McCarthyism is in high gear.\n\nAt Morehouse College, where King studied as an undergraduate, there were an array of scholar-activists on campus who were not particularly secretive about their leftist sympathies. King's mentor at Morehouse, Benjamin Mays, was an exponent of the social gospel who served on the board of the Southern Conference for Human Welfare, the Southern Conference Educational Fund, and several other organizations.\n\nAnother mentor of King's during this period, Brailsford Brazeal, was the leading scholarly authority on the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, and served on the board of Highlander Folk School. Samuel Williams, King's philosophy professor, was a statewide leader of the Progressive Party. King's religion professor, George Kelsey, published anti-capitalist tracts. King's sociology professor, Walter Chivers, was president of the Atlanta University affiliate of a left-led union that tried to organize the AU faculty. Several of King's professors and friends at Morehouse were active in the Southern Negro Youth Congress, which had a chapter on campus.\n\nAt Crozer [Theological Seminary], King had progressive mentors like Rev. J. Pius Barbour, and read the works of socialist theologians, such as Reinhold Niebuhr's Moral Man in Immoral Society . He also read Marx's Capital , mostly agreeing with Marx's critique of capitalism, but rejecting his atheism.\n\nAt Boston University (BU), where King pursued his doctoral studies, deans Walter G. Muelder and Howard Thurman were pacifists and socialists, as were philosopher Edgar S. Brightman and theologian Paul Schilling. King's dissertation advisor, Harold DeWolf, wasn't a self-described socialist or pacifist, but he stuck his neck out to criticize the House Un-American Activities Committee and published an article titled \"Was Jesus a Communist?\" that took the question seriously. Coretta Scott was a former Progressive Party activist who gifted King the classic socialist novel by Edward Bellamy, Looking Backward . King led a circle of BU grad students who called themselves The Dialectical Society and which included folks like Douglas Moore, another former Progressive Party activist who would later help launch SCLC.\n\nI think an important shift occurred during the 1955-56 Montgomery bus boycott, when King discovered that Old Left activists and networks could provide much-needed assistance to a major civil rights struggle. Locally in Montgomery, King leaned on the skills of several black and white activists with backgrounds in the Old Left broadly construed, including Cliff and Virginia Durr, E. D. Nixon, and Rosa Parks. King also benefited from the fundraising and strategic advice of In Friendship, an organization based in New York City, cofounded by Old Left veterans Rustin, Baker, and Levison, with the backing of A. Philip Randolph.\n\nThis is somewhat speculative, but to what extent do you think these ties shaped his own politics, and did they push him to think or strategize about fighting racism in a particular way?\n\nIn King's first book, Stride Toward Freedom (1958), there's a section where he argues that the civil rights movement and the labor movement should be supporting each other. King knew this wasn't going to happen automatically; he recognized that there were progressive unions and conservative unions.\n\nBut the idea that labor and civil rights struggles could and should be joined was a commonplace within the intellectual and activist circles that King moved in. He reiterated this argument repeatedly, for example in Why We Can't Wait (1964), where he wrote: \"The withholding of support from the March on Washington by the National Council of the AFL-CIO was a blunder. . . . Nothing would hold back the forces of progress in American life more effectively than a schism between the Negro and organized labor.\"\n\nI only touch on this briefly in my article, but I think that by the late 1960s, socialism for King went from being a lofty but distant dream, mostly discussed in private, to a strategic imperative that he started talking about more openly. With the escalation of the Vietnam War and urban uprisings across the United States, King concluded that we have to connect the struggles for economic justice, for racial justice, and against militarism, or we're not going to win on any of these fronts.\n\nYou talk about many, many figures from SCLC with Old Left connections in the piece, so we can't go through them all, but were there any that really stuck out or surprised you?\n\nThe thing that surprised me the most was the prominent SCLC leaders whose Old Left backgrounds have flown completely under the radar until now. For example, Rev. Joseph Lowery served as Second Vice President of SCLC for most of the 1960s. Shortly before his death a few years ago, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and rightly so.\n\nDuring the mid-1940s, Lowery lived in Birmingham, Alabama, which was the stronghold of the Southern Negro Youth Congress (SNYC), a broad-tent anti-racist organization with many communists in leadership positions. When I emailed Rev. Lowery to ask if he was familiar with the SNYC, he acknowledged that he had \"participated in some activities\" sponsored by the group. I combed local newspapers and SNYC organizational records, and learned that Lowery led a SNYC recruitment drive in an industrial suburb of Birmingham. He also helped the organization investigate the death of Willie Daniel , a black man murdered in a store by a white security guard.\n\nIn the article, I try to contextualize why someone like Lowery, who was not a communist by any stretch, would be attracted to a group like the SNYC. In those days, if you were a young person who wanted to fight back against segregation, disenfranchisement, racist murders, and evictions, that's where the action was. The Old Left was often in the forefront of anti-racist struggles.\n\nC. T. Vivian is another figure that isn't super obscure, but his Old Left background isn't well known.\n\nRev. Vivian is another towering figure in the civil rights movement, who like Lowery received the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his lifetime of service to the cause of racial justice. Before becoming an SCLC staffer, Vivian helped lead the nonviolent movement in Nashville, was arrested for participating in the Freedom Rides, etc. During the mid-1960s, he served as SCLC's Director of Affiliates.\n\nThe received wisdom is that Vivian first experimented with direct action protest in Peoria during the 1940s, where he and a group of mostly middle-class professionals and students sat in at segregated restaurants, inspired by what the recently formed CORE was doing in Chicago.\n\nAll this is true, but I found that Vivian was also part of another activist network during that same period, comprised mainly of blue-collar workers employed at Peoria's Caterpillar tractor factory. Vivian was close friends with a guy named Ajay Martin, a young African American union activist who became a national officer of the United Farm Equipment and Metal Workers (FE), a left-led union. Vivian remembered Martin as \"one of the greatest guys I've ever met. . . . Here was a man that couldn't be bought. Here was a man who had integrity. Here was a man who stood up.\" Martin ended up resigning from the FE executive board in 1948 because he refused to sign an anti-communist affidavit as required by the Taft-Hartley Act .\n\nWe're talking on the eve of the sixtieth anniversary of the March on Washington. How should this history of the connections between SCLC and the Old Left shape how we think about the March on Washington?\n\nIt's a good example of how the strategies and ideas of the Old Left carried over to an extent,  because the architects of the March had Old Left backgrounds - including A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, and Cleveland Robinson, a leader of the Negro American Labor Council and the District 65 union in New York City.\n\nThe march itself combined demands for stronger civil rights legislation, raising the minimum wage, and a massive federal jobs program. It was the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom - not for one or the other. Randolph spoke at the march and highlighted the multifaceted nature of the struggle. So I think that's one clear example of how the attempt to link the struggle for economic justice and racial justice manifested in the 1960s.\n\nLet's jump to today. The labor movement is very weak, yet there's lots of evidence that many of the young people involved in the current unionization upsurge were politicized or radicalized by the George Floyd protests. How do you think this long-buried tradition that you've been talking about should inform current struggles against racial oppression?\n\nI think the labor movement can play an important role in anti-racist struggles, especially if the multiracial left contends for influence and leadership in the labor movement. But to put it bluntly: the Left needs to walk and chew gum. It's not one or the other: fighting for class demands, or fighting against racism. We need to fight against all forms of injustice and inequality in workplaces and in the wider society. Differences and disagreements aside, that is something the Old Left can teach us. But this lesson has been forgotten to some extent, partly because of McCarthyism.\n\nI also think we need to acknowledge that Black Lives Matter (BLM) activists today are navigating a complicated terrain. On the one hand, the movement faced vicious repression at hands of police at the height of the struggle, followed now by a vitriolic racist backlash stoked by neanderthal Republicans. On the other hand, there have been aggressive cooptation efforts by liberal politicians and NGOs.\n\nThe backdrop to all this is the weakness of the labor movement, and of the Left within it. Rebuilding the labor left is strategically critical, but it's also a long-term project. We shouldn't be surprised that BLM folks aren't putting all their eggs in the labor basket. Civil rights activists in the 1950s and sixties didn't either. Someone like King was looking for opportunities to build coalitions and collaboration with labor. SCLC leaders regularly spoke at union gatherings. King died supporting a labor struggle in Memphis. But they were also building SCLC, a civil rights organization.\n\nAll that said, I'm optimistic that BLM, especially since 2020, is helping reinvigorate labor, as you suggested. The fact that you've got young people, millions of them, who have taken to the streets, have braved cops and tear gas - that desire to fight back, that willingness to shut things down to win change, doesn't just vanish because a wave of struggle ebbs. That sentiment often bleeds into other spheres, including the workplace. So I'm optimistic that that wave of struggle can, and is helping, reinvigorate labor.\n\nThere's a precedent for this. In the 1960s, the civil rights, antiwar, and feminist movements helped reinvigorate the labor movement. Folks that were protesting for other things and learning how to organize, gaining confidence in their own power, carried that boldness and those skills into other arenas .\n\nThe Old Left had a lot of problems and weaknesses, and I don't want to make it sound like solidarity is automatic or easy. But I think they were on to something when they said: capitalism relies on divide-and-conquer tactics to survive. You can only get so far fighting the bosses and their politicians if you're not challenging all the divisions within the working class. Labor struggles are a context in which it's possible - again, not inevitable, but possible - to break down prejudices . And historically, socialists have played a really important role in advancing those kinds of struggles .\n\nMatthew F.

It's an excellent resource for understanding the origins of war under capitalism and helping leftists maintain our clear opposition to it.\n\nWhile most parties of the Second International suppored their countries' drives to war in World War I, Rosa Luxemburg was among the socialist leaders who opposed the war. (Ashton Emanuel / Flickr)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhile political science has probed the ideological, political, economic, and even psychological motivations behind the drive to war, socialist theory has made a unique contribution by highlighting the relationship between the development of capitalism and war. The Left has long theorized its opposition to war, and the main positions of socialist theorists and organizations over the past 150 years offer useful resources for opposing Russia's aggression against Ukraine, as well as for continuing to oppose NATO.\n\nRarely have wars - not to be confused with revolutions - had the democratizing effect that the theorists of socialism hoped for. Indeed, they have often proved themselves to be the worst way of carrying out a revolution, both because of the human cost and because of the destruction of the productive forces that they entail. If this was true in the past, it is even more evident in contemporary societies where weapons of mass destruction are continually proliferating.\n\nIn the debates of the First International, César de Paepe, one of its principal leaders, formulated what would become the classical position of the workers' movement on the question of war: namely, that wars are inevitable under the regime of capitalist production. In contemporary society, they are brought about not by the ambitions of monarchs or other individuals but by the dominant social-economic model. The lesson for the workers' movement came from the belief that any war should be considered \"a civil war,\" a ferocious clash between workers that deprived them of the means necessary for their survival.\n\nKarl Marx never developed any consistent or systematic position on war in his writings. In Capital , volume 1, he argued that violence was an economic force, \"the midwife of every old society pregnant with a new one.\" But he did not think of war as a crucial shortcut for the revolutionary transformation of society, and a major aim of his political activity was to commit workers to the principle of international solidarity.\n\nWar was such an important question for Friedrich Engels that he devoted one of his last pieces of writing to it. In his pamphlet \"Can Europe Disarm?\", he noted that in the previous twenty-five years, every major power had tried to outdo its rivals militarily and in terms of war preparations. This had involved unprecedented levels of arms production and brought the old continent closer to \"a war of destruction such as the world has never seen.\"\n\nAccording to Engels, \"The system of standing armies has been carried to such extremes throughout Europe that it must either bring economic ruin to the peoples on account of the military burden, or else degenerate into a general war of extermination.\" He emphasized that standing armies were maintained just as much for reasons of domestic politics as they were for external military purposes. They were intended \"to provide protection not so much against the external enemy as the internal one,\" Engels wrote, by strengthening the forces to repress the proletariat and workers' struggles. As popular layers paid more than anyone else the costs of war, through taxes and the provision of troops to the state, the workers' movement should fight for \"the gradual reduction of the term of [military] service by international treaty\" and for disarmament as the only effective \"guarantee of peace.\"\n\nIt was not long before a peacetime theoretical debate turned into the foremost political issue of the age. Initially, representatives of the workers' movement opposed any support for war when the Franco-Prussian conflict (the one that preceded the Paris Commune) erupted in 1870. The Social Democratic deputies Wilhelm Liebknecht and August Bebel condemned the annexationist objectives of Bismarck's Germany and voted against war credits. Their decision to \"reject the bill for additional funding to continue the war\" earned them a two-year prison sentence for high treason, but it helped to show the working class an alternative way to build on the crisis.\n\nAs the major European powers kept up their imperialist expansion, the controversy on war acquired ever greater weight in the debates of the Second International. A resolution adopted at its founding congress had enshrined peace as \"the indispensable precondition of any emancipation of the workers.\"\n\nAs the Weltpolitik - the aggressive policy of imperial Germany to extend its power in the international arena - changed the geopolitical setting, anti-militarist principles sank deeper roots in the workers' movement and influenced the discussions on armed conflicts. War was no longer seen only as hastening the breakdown of the system (an idea on the Left going back to Maximilien Robespierre's slogan, \"no revolution without revolution.\") It was now viewed as a danger because of its grievous consequences for the proletariat in the shape of hunger, destitution, and unemployment.\n\nThe resolution \"On Militarism and International Conflicts,\" adopted by the Second International at its Stuttgart congress in 1907, recapitulated all the key points that had become the common heritage of the workers' movement. Among these were a vote against budgets that increased military spending, antipathy to standing armies, and a preference for a system of people's militias.\n\nAs the years passed, the Second International commitment to peace lessened, and by the time of World War I, the majority of European socialist parties voted to support it - a course of action that had disastrous consequences. Arguing that the \"benefits of progress\" should not be monopolized by the capitalists, the workers' movement came to share the expansionist aims of the ruling classes and was swamped by nationalist ideology. In this sense, the Second International proved completely impotent in the face of the war, ceding its own aim to preserve peace.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, it was Rosa Luxemburg and Vladimir Lenin who were two of the most vigorous opponents of the war. Articulate and principled, Luxemburg demonstrated how militarism was a key vertebra of the state and worked to make the \"War on war!\" slogan \"the cornerstone of working-class politics.\" As she wrote in The Crisis of German Social Democracy , the Second International had imploded because it failed \"to achieve a common tactic and action by the proletariat in all countries.\" From then on, the \"main goal\" of the proletariat should therefore be \"fighting imperialism and preventing wars, in peace as in war.\"\n\nIn Socialism and the War - among other writings penned during World War I - Lenin's great merit was to identify two fundamental questions. The first concerned the \"historical falsification\" at work whenever the bourgeoisie tried to attribute a \"progressive sense of national liberation\" to what were in reality wars of \"plunder.\"\n\nThe second was the masking of contradictions by the social reformists who had replaced the class struggle with a claim on \"morsels of the profits obtained by their national bourgeoisie through the looting of other countries.\" The most celebrated thesis of this pamphlet - that revolutionaries should seek to \"turn imperialist war into civil war\" - implied that those who really wanted a \"lasting democratic peace\" had to wage \"civil war against their governments and the bourgeoisie.\" Lenin was convinced of what history would later show to be inaccurate: that any class struggle consistently waged in time of war would \"inevitably\" create a revolutionary spirit among the masses.\n\nWorld War I produced divisions not only in the Second International but also in the anarchist movement. In an article published shortly after the outbreak of the conflict, Peter Kropotkin wrote that \"the task of any person holding dear the idea of human progress is to squash the German invasion in Western Europe.\"\n\nIn a reply to Kropotkin, the Italian anarchist Errico Malatesta argued that, although he was not a pacifist and thought it legitimate to take up arms in a war of liberation, the world war was not - as bourgeois propaganda asserted - a struggle \"for the general good against the common enemy\" of democracy but yet another example of the ruling-class subjugation of the working masses. He was aware that \"a German victory would certainly spell the triumph of militarism, but also that a triumph for the Allies would mean Russian-British domination in Europe and Asia.\"\n\nIn the Manifesto of the Sixteen , Kropotkin upheld the need \"to resist an aggressor who represents the destruction of all our hopes of liberation.\" Victory for the Triple Entente against Germany would be the lesser evil and do less to undermine the existing liberties. On the other side, Malatesta and his fellow-signatories of T he Anarchist International A ntiwar M anifesto declared, \"No distinction is possible between offensive and defensive wars.\" Moreover, they added that \"none of the belligerents has any right to lay claim to civilization, just as none of them is entitled to claim legitimate self-defense.\" For Malatesta, Emma Goldman, Ferdinand Nieuwenhuis, and the great majority of the anarchist movement, World War I was a further episode in the conflict among capitalists of various imperialist powers, which was being waged at the expense of the working class. With no \"ifs\" or \"buts,\" they stuck with the slogan \"no man and no penny for the army,\" firmly rejecting even indirect support for the pursuit of war.\n\nAttitudes to the war also aroused debate in the feminist movement. The need for women to replace conscripted men in jobs - for much lower wages, in conditions of overexploitation - encouraged support for war in a sizable part of the newborn suffragette movement. Some of its leaders went so far as to petition for laws allowing the enlistment of women in the armed forces. Yet more radical, antiwar elements persisted. Communist feminists worked to expose duplicitous governments, which were using the war to roll back fundamental social reforms\n\nClara Zetkin, Alexandra Kollontai, Sylvia Pankhurst, and of course Rosa Luxemburg were among the first to embark lucidly and courageously on the path that would show successive generations how the struggle against militarism was essential to the struggle against patriarchy. Later, the rejection of war became a distinctive part of International Women's Day, and opposition to war budgets at the outbreak of any new conflict featured prominently in many platforms of the international feminist movement.\n\nWith the rise of fascism and the outbreak of World War II, violence escalated still further. After Adolph Hitler's troops attacked the Soviet Union in 1941, the Great Patriotic War that ended with the defeat of Nazism became such a central element in Russian national unity that it survived the fall of the Berlin Wall and has lasted until our own days.\n\nWith the postwar division of the world into two blocs, Joseph Stalin taught that the main task of the international communist movement was to safeguard the Soviet Union. The creation of a buffer zone of eight countries in Eastern Europe was a central pillar of this policy. From 1961, under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet Union began a new political course that came to be known as \"peaceful coexistence.\" However, this attempt at constructive cooperation was geared only to the United States, not to the other countries of \"actually existing socialism.\"\n\nThe Soviet Union had already brutally crushed the Hungarian Revolution in 1956. Similar events took place in 1968 in Czechoslovakia. Faced with demands for democratization during the \"Prague Spring,\" the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided unanimously to send in half a million soldiers and thousands of tanks. Leonid Brezhnev explained the action by referring to what he called the \"limited sovereignty\" of Warsaw Pact countries: \"When forces that are hostile to socialism try to turn the development of some socialist country toward capitalism, it becomes not only a problem of the country concerned, but a common problem and concern of all socialist countries.\" According to this antidemocratic logic, the definition of what was and was not \"socialism\" naturally fell to the arbitrary decision of the Soviet leaders.\n\nWith the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, the Red Army again became a major instrument of Moscow's foreign policy, which continued to claim the right to intervene in what it described as its own \"security zone.\" These military interventions not only worked against a general arms reduction but served to discredit and globally weaken socialism. The Soviet Union was increasingly seen as an imperial power acting in ways not unlike those of the United States, which, since the onset of the Cold War, had more or less secretly backed coups d'état and helped to overthrow democratically elected governments in more than twenty countries around the world.\n\nWith the onset of the Russian-Ukrainian war, the Left is once again confronted with the question of how to position itself when a country's sovereignty is under attack. It is a mistake for governments like Venezuela's to refuse condemnation of the invasion. This will make denunciations of possible future acts of aggression by the United States appear less credible. We might recall Lenin's words in The Socialist Revolution and the Right of Nations to Self-Determination :\n\nThe fact that the struggle for national liberation against one imperialist power may, under certain circumstances, be utilized by another \"Great\" Power in its equally imperialist interests should have no more weight in inducing Social Democracy to renounce its recognition of the right of nations to self-determination.\n\nThe Left has historically supported the principle of national self-determination and defended the right of individual states to establish their frontiers on the basis of the express will of the population. Making direct reference to Ukraine, in Results of the Discussion on Self-Determination , Lenin argued:\n\nIf the socialist revolution were to be victorious in Petrograd, Berlin, and Warsaw, the Polish socialist government, like the Russian and German socialist governments, would renounce the \"forcible retention\" of, say, the Ukrainians within the frontiers of the Polish state.\n\nWhy suggest, then, that anything different should be conceded to the nationalist government led by Vladimir Putin?\n\nOn the other hand, all too many on the Left have yielded to the temptation to become - directly or indirectly - cobelligerents, fueling a new union sacr ée . Such a position today serves increasingly to blur the distinction between Atlanticism and pacifism. History shows that, when they do not oppose war, progressive forces lose an essential part of their reason for existence and end up swallowing the ideology of the opposite camp. This happens whenever left parties make their presence in government the essential element of their political action - as the Italian Communists did in supporting the NATO interventions in Kosovo and Afghanistan, or as does much of today's Unidas Podemos, which joins the chorus of the Spanish parliament in favor of sending weapons to the Ukrainian army.\n\nReflecting on the Crimean War, in 1854 Marx opposed liberal democrats who exalted the anti-Russian coalition:\n\nIt is a mistake to describe the war against Russia as a war between liberty and despotism. Apart from the fact that if such be the case, liberty would be for the nonce represented by a Bonaparte, the whole avowed object of the war is the maintenance . . . of the Vienna treaties - those very treaties which annul the liberty and independence of nations.\n\nIf we replace Bonaparte with the United States and the Vienna treaties with NATO, these observations seem as if written for today.\n\nIn today's discourse, those who oppose both Russian and Ukrainian nationalism, as well as the expansion of NATO, are often accused of political indecision or simple naivete. But this is not the case. The position of those who propose a policy of nonalignment is the most effective way of ending the war as soon as possible and ensuring the smallest number of victims. It is necessary to pursue ceaseless diplomatic activity based on two firm points: de-escalation and the neutrality of independent Ukraine.\n\nFurthermore, although support for NATO across Europe appears strengthened since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it is necessary to work harder to ensure that public opinion does not see the largest and most aggressive war machine in the world - NATO - as the solution to the problems of global security. It must be shown that it is a dangerous and ineffectual organization, which, in its drive for expansion and unipolar domination, serves to fuel tensions leading to war in the world.\n\nFor the Left, war cannot be \"the continuation of politics by other means,\" to quote Carl von Clausewitz's famous dictum. In reality, it merely certifies the failure of politics. If the Left wishes to become hegemonic and to show itself capable of using its history for the tasks of today, it needs to write indelibly on its banners the words \"anti-militarism\" and \"No to war!\"\n\nMarcello Musto is the author of Another Marx: Early Manuscripts to the International and The Last Years of Karl Marx: An Intellectual Biography .

But in the first half of the twentieth century, queer people were abundant among American radical leftists - decades before the rise of an organized mass movement for gay rights.\n\nHarry Hay, communist, gay rights activist, and cofounder of the Mattachine Society, in 1996.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nReview of Love's Next Meeting: The Forgotten History of Homosexuality and the Left in American Culture , by Aaron S. Lecklider (University of California Press, 2021)\n\nBack in October, a mini-viral tweet asked writers, \"Give the worst possible elevator pitch for your book.\" Aaron S. Lecklider, a professor of American studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston, replied , \"Queer people actually were national security risks.\"\n\nThe jokey tweet alludes to a violent history: that of the \" Lavender Scare ,\" the mid-century moral panic in which federal and state officials purged thousands of queer people from government employment on the grounds that \"sexual perverts\" were \"perhaps as dangerous as the actual Communists,\" as one Republican politician put it in 1950. The Lavender Scare - intimately connected to but ultimately distinct from the McCarthyite \"Red Scare\" - contributed immensely to hateful popular understandings of queerness as a psychological disease and a danger to \"normal\" people.\n\nIt also led much of the burgeoning gay rights movement to insist that queers were not dangerous - at least, so long as they were clean-cut, white, bourgeois, and conformed to conventional gender norms.\n\nImplicit in this commitment to \" respectable queerness \" was an erasure of the presence of queer people who did not fit neatly into normative boxes. Post-Stonewall, those who were often marginalized and ignored included the radical queers that threw bottles at Stonewall, founded the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) and Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR), and fundamentally changed the trajectory of the early years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. But what of the radical queers in the years before the Lavender Scare? Who were they?\n\nOne stab at answering this question is Lecklider's invigorating new book Love's Next Meeting: The Forgotten History of Homosexuality and the Left in American Culture - the one about how queer people \"actually were national security risks.\" Indeed, writes Lecklider, in the first half of the twentieth century, \"a broad cross-section of sexual dissidents . . . took advantage of their space on the margins of American society to throw themselves into leftist campaigns.\"\n\nIn other words, queer people were abundant among American radicals decades before the rise of an organized mass movement for gay rights. And while much of the scholarship on queer history \"discounts the Old Left due to its perceived homophobia,\" Lecklider locates a \"counterhistory where possibility, visibility, and resistance converged at the intersection of homosexuality and the Left.\"\n\nLecklider has scoured the archives for relevant records, letters, and diaries. But, as anyone who has attempted queer history can attest, there is a real dearth of traditional archival sources that allow scholars access to queer people's private lives and inner thoughts. This is doubly true when it comes to queer leftists.\n\n\"Chrisesakes, man,\" the aging gay communist Harry Hay wrote to a historian in 1974, \"who among us Reds was stoopid enough to keep records through TWO Witch-hunts.\"\n\nIn spite of this documentary challenge, however, Lecklider has supplemented his archival sleuthing with insightful interpretations of \"cultural works\" - novels, poems, and memoirs - many of which reveal far more of a queer presence on the Left than, say, the official records of the Communist Party. The result is a startling and joyful work of scholarship, a book about revolutionary people that feels revolutionary itself.\n\n\"It takes two revolutions to make a new world,\" wrote a radical journalist in 1927, \"one in the sphere of economics and one in the sphere of erotics.\" And, indeed, many in the early twentieth century saw the fight against capitalism and the fight against oppressive sexual mores as inextricably linked.\n\nThis view emerged, in part, because queers and leftists ended up running into one another so often during these years. This constant proximity bred mutual sympathy and, eventually, solidarity.\n\nQueer people and radicals often found themselves excluded from mainstream society, especially during the Depression, and this led many of them to ride the rails. Others sought refuge in hobo camps and public parks. Radical unionists and utopian freethinkers rubbed shoulders with hustlers and sex workers. Some began to suggest that they might, in fact, be fighting the same forces.\n\nThe allure of the Soviet Union likewise attracted both leftists and queers. Many Americans in the 1920s and 1930s imagined the USSR as \"livelier and more sexually open\" than the United States. Indeed, sodomy had been effectively decriminalized following the Russian Revolution in 1917 and explicitly decriminalized in 1922. Both leftists and queers made pilgrimages to the Soviet Union during these years, seeking better lives, and though \"lived realities in the USSR did not always match up with Soviet ideals,\" as Lecklider carefully puts it, many Soviet writers and thinkers were far more open-minded than their American counterparts about sexuality. After sodomy was recriminalized in the USSR in the 1930s under Joseph Stalin, a \"quiet but significant international response\" arose, with several leftist writers denouncing the reversal.\n\nAdditionally, leftists and queers were both forced to battle obscenity laws in the United States. Unsurprisingly, government censors policed the language and activities of those promoting transgressive sexual behavior, but these same officials also ruthlessly targeted Communists and labor radicals. As a result, notes Lecklider, many leftist editors ended up fighting against instances of censorship \"regardless of whether they targeted sexual content or radical politics.\" Further, in an attempt to subvert, mock, and resist the constant censorship and surveillance of speech, many leftist writers and editors began adopting a \"camp style\" that embraced sexual deviance and attracted \"thrill-seeking readers,\" including queers.\n\nLabor unions, shop floors, and sex work all represented sites where leftists learned about homosexuality and queers joined in radical struggle. Many places of labor - especially in the maritime industry, where so many men lived and worked closely together - led to political-sexual alliances.\n\nThe San Francisco-based Marine Cooks and Stewards Union, for instance, developed a reputation that it was \"a third red, a third black, and a third queer,\" as one member recalled; its own members sometimes called it \"Marine Cocksuckers and Fruits,\" and its publications portrayed smiling interracial gay couples.\n\nProstitution, too, \"connected working-class communities with sexual transgression,\" Lecklider continues, at a time when \"homosexuality was intimately connected with sex work.\" In fact, in his famous mid-century studies of sexuality, Alfred Kinsey noted that the \"lowest classes had the most incidents of homosexuality.\" Leftist writers came to view \"male hustling\" as the workers controlling their own means of production, and capitalism as the true \"perversion.\"\n\nLecklider pays particular attention to the ways that some leftists \"repurposed resistance to American capitalist institutions and racist structures to advance a radical position on homosexuality.\" Many black Communists compared the discrimination they faced on account of their race to the hatred they or others endured because of their sexuality.\n\nJohn Pittman, for instance, wrote that \"both race prejudice and the prejudice against homosexuals are bolstered and maintained by social taboo and the law . . . Both prejudices make life in this world a living hell for men and women whose only crime is that of being DIFFERENT from the majority.\" This view occasionally forced organizations like the Communist Party to defend queer rights, especially as the institutional left strove to be on the vanguard of the fight against racial oppression.\n\nLecklider also devotes considerable analysis to the radicalism of queer women in the early twentieth century. In spite of their marginalization within the institutional left, many women did join groups like the Communist Party, with some even assuming positions of leadership. A number of these women took advantage of the Left's iconographic celebration of female strength to explore and exult in their own butchness. Others used lesbian bars to build solidarity with working-class patrons.\n\nLecklider focuses in particular on the (often coded) explorations of lesbian desire by leftist female writers of the time, including Carson McCullers, Pauli Murray , and Jo Sinclair. Some queer women even viewed their transgressive romantic attachments through the lens of their politics - Lecklider notes two apparently queer women who signed their notes to each other with \"I love you\" written in Russian.\n\nIn sum, a small but thriving collection of queer leftists were active in the years before World War II, and a larger number of interactions brought queers and leftists together during this time. To be clear, some degree of homophobia was constant on the American left during the early twentieth century, as reflected in official party policies and in art and writing from the time. \"The relationship between homosexuality and the Left was never easy,\" Lecklider writes. Nonetheless, he continues, the Left cannot be \"defined entirely by homophobia.\"\n\nAs the twentieth century continued, the relationship between queerness and the Left morphed repeatedly.\n\nFirst came the rise of anti-fascism in the 1930s and 1940s. In many ways, this presented new opportunities for queer-Left alliances. Eager to portray themselves as radically inclusive (in contrast to fascists), leaders of many leftist spaces became more open to queer presence and advocacy. The rise of the \"Popular Front\" - an imperative that led the Communist Party to align with less radical groups on the Left, putting difference aside in an effort to prioritize defeating the Nazi threat - enabled queers to take advantage of the celebration of diversity and demand inclusion, especially as the Nazis' particular hatred of homosexuals became widely known. The Spanish Civil War represented a seminal moment in which many on the Left formed bonds of homosocial intimacy in the trenches that occasionally became sexual.\n\nYet the fight against fascism and the rise of the Popular Front also committed the Left to \"gentler forms of coalition building,\" in contrast to earlier, more revolutionary calls to overthrow capitalism. By abandoning their demand for a total rejection of the American state, many on the Left also abandoned their more radical critiques of the American status quo - a status quo that included legalized homophobia.\n\nFurther, as Lecklider argues, the Popular Front led to a discourse that \"framed homosexuality in the language of human rights and tolerance and reconceived American history as a teleological march of progress,\" which in turn moved the emerging gay rights movement away from the more steadfast \"opposition to racial capitalism that had for decades informed the relationship between homosexuality and the Left.\"\n\nThe Cold War cemented this shift. While many of the earliest queer rights organizations, including ONE Inc., the Mattachine Society, and Knights of the Clock, had leftist or Communist founders, the fear engendered by the Lavender Scare led these organizations to declare themselves fervently anti-communist and expel their more radical founders. Facing a state that declared that queers were national security threats - which many had, in fact, been - these organizations insisted they were not.\n\nAs Lecklider notes, this led to a homophile movement \"detached from its radical history and overly invested in normativity and whiteness.\" Sex workers, militant labor activists, black Communists - all were excluded. \"Homosexuals needed to prove themselves to be good capitalists and model citizens in order to secure protection under law,\" Lecklider dryly writes.\n\nWhereas members had spent the homophile groups' early years drawing parallels between homosexuals and \"the Negro, Mexican, and Jewish Peoples\" - waging fights on behalf of queers of color and battling legal restrictions on interracial same-sex couples - soon these groups turned away from this sort of activism, even toning down their critiques of the police.\n\nThe consequences were politically and personally devastating. One of Mattachine's exiled leftist founders committed suicide. Many others destroyed their personal papers. Meanwhile, the Communist Party officially expelled gay members \"because of their presumed openness to blackmail as state repression increased.\"\n\nNonetheless, Lecklider concludes, some queer leftists did manage to remain outspoken during the Cold War. When, for instance, the activity of the organized Left began to dovetail more with the civil rights movement, several queer Black leftists became some of the sharpest and most prominent critics of the American state and empire, including Bayard Rustin, James Baldwin , and Lorraine Hansberry . Their work helped keep the flame of queer leftism burning until the 1960s, when \"thunderous waves of uprisings and protest\" more firmly united queers and the Left in the gay liberation movement.\n\nAlthough it is an excellent work of history, it would be a mistake to classify Love's Next Meeting as simply a historical work. To do so would serve to underestimate the book's boldest intervention: injecting some hope into too-often dismal histories - and, by extension, into our desolate present.\n\nConsidering the bleakness of so much of its subject matter, Love's Next Meeting is a strikingly optimistic book. No matter how isolated or marginalized his protagonists, Lecklider makes sure to note their resistance or resilience; no matter how depressing the trajectory of liberatory movements, Lecklider makes space for those who could reframe their own dispossession \"as a site of solidarity working toward revolution.\"\n\nLecklider is, of course, careful to note the constancy of leftist homophobia, and the relative rarity of explicit pro-queer political commitments from the institutional Left. Nonetheless, he appears to delight in the intriguing insinuations, the myriad connections, and the remarkable overlaps that, together, gesture to a far more robust Left-queer alliance than most scholars have recognized.\n\nAlthough few sources survive to document queer-Left collaboration within the lumpenproletariat, Lecklider nonetheless devotes space and energy to the revolutionary activities of sex workers, hobos, immigrants, and other marginalized members of American society. Although the sources that do remain disproportionately contain the voices of the literate and the literary, and those living in urban spaces (especially in the north), Lecklider still manages to read many traditional texts in highly innovative ways, unearthing thrilling possibilities from deep in the archive.\n\nPerhaps the quality that best embodies Lecklider's hopeful intervention is his unabashed joy that the story of queer leftists survived - in the archive and in cultural texts - at all. \"For even with gaps and redactions and fires and excisions and smears and hearings and expulsions and narrative displacements,\" he concludes, queers on the Left were \"never truly alone.\"\n\nScott W.

We should celebrate him today as part of the great radical democratic tradition.\n\nA print based on David Gilmour Blythe's painting of Abraham Lincoln writing the Emancipation Proclamation.

As early as 1894, while head of the short-lived American Railway Union, admirers began to compare the embattled labor leader to another Midwesterner, Abraham Lincoln. Hearing Debs speak that summer, former abolitionist John Swinton saw in the Indiana native a \"new western leader in the struggle for labor's emancipation.\" Like Lincoln, Debs was a \"foe of slavery\" who championed working people, and his Socialists represented the \"logical sequence\" in an emancipatory politics that began with the early Republican Party . A growing body of followers agreed, and the names \"Lincoln\" and \"Debs\" soon appeared side-by-side in the press as part of a new cultural memory within the labor left.\n\nDebs leaned hard into the analogy. He and other Socialists consistently reached back to the previous century to frame socialism as a homegrown political tradition and draw lessons from the Civil War era - from John Brown , Wendell Phillips , and, perhaps especially, Lincoln . Leading a vigil at Lincoln's Tomb in the fall of 1906, Debs proclaimed that as long as capitalist domination and the slavery of wages persisted, Lincoln's work remained unfinished. \"Slave power,\" he declared from the mausoleum terrace, \"which loathed and despised Lincoln, was no more heartless than the power of capitalism, which to-day holds the workingmen of the Nation in bondage.\" Although most Gilded Age and Progressive Era Socialists agreed that the fight against \"wage slavery\" required a \"new emancipator,\" the original emancipator was never far from their minds.\n\nPublished four years later, first in the Chicago Daily Socialist and then in pamphlet form, party activist Burke McCarty's Little Sermons in Socialism by Abraham Lincoln exemplified the leftist affinity for the sixteenth president. \"We do not claim that Abraham Lincoln was a Socialist, for the word had not been coined in his day,\" McCarty explained. \"We do not claim that he would, if he had lived, been a Socialist today, for we do not know this.\" What McCarty did claim is that Lincoln was a product of the laboring classes and that, for the entirety of his political career, his sympathies remained with working people. Although he was not a revolutionary per se, McCarty admitted, Lincoln nevertheless grasped the \"central concept\" of socialism: the primacy of labor over capital, and of liberty before property.\n\nMost Americans today spend little time thinking about Lincoln, but they do carry in their minds a constellation of ideas, symbols, images, and characterizations they associate with him. In his 1995 book, Lincoln in American Memory , historian Merrill Peterson identifies five primary and frequently overlapping Lincoln \"types\" within the US public's collective memory: the Savior of the Union, the Great Emancipator, the Man of the People, the Frontier American, and the Self-Made Man.\n\nBut Peterson overlooked a critical sixth type, one that's as timeworn as the others: the workerist Lincoln. Seemingly from the moment of Lincoln's martyrdom, the nascent labor movement presented him as a workingman, an ally of labor, and a symbol of the revolutionary proletariat to organize workers and envision a more democratic future. Freedpeople, black conventioneers, postwar labor federations, early Marxists, industrial unionists, and interracial farmer-labor radicals all portrayed the uncompensated destruction of chattel bondage as the pivotal first step in a wider emancipation of labor. In doing so they employed (often generous characterizations of) Lincoln's prolabor speeches, such as his comments on the 1860 shoemakers strike in New England, the largest walkout to date.\n\nThese evocations of a prolabor Lincoln appealed to working-class Civil War veterans; attracted African Americans to organized labor's cause; and cast immigrant workers with few cultural ties to the United States as part of a comprehensible domestic tradition led by that most American of Americans.\n\nAbove all, they sought to make good on the implied promise of emancipation: that labor should not only be legally free, but also possess enough power to ensure basic dignity if not full-on productive control. Their interpretation of Lincoln's \"free labor\" ideal was not the compulsion to sell one's labor on conditions largely determined by owners - the \"freedom\" to work or starve. Rather, it was worker power, secured through some degree of economic democracy.\n\nThe New Deal era witnessed an enhanced expression of that power - and of Lincoln memory. As historian Nina Silber argues , Americans broadened the Lincoln symbol during the 1930s beyond sectional reconciliation and liberal nationalism and toward anti-fascism and federal power in the service of common people.\n\nFor countless workers, President Franklin D. Roosevelt became a \"new Lincoln\" and his New Deal programs a \"second Emancipation Proclamation.\" As Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) official Len De Caux explained, \"Our idea of a 'new birth of freedom' is an expansion of collective bargaining and industrial democracy.\"\n\nMarxists, in particular, fused this workerist Lincoln with racial justice themes. While scholars including James S. Allen, Herbert Aptheker, and W. E. B. Du Bois provided more nuanced assessments of the president - Du Bois famously admired him as a \"growing man\" -Communists in the 1930s adopted the \"Great Emancipator\" symbol and cast Lincoln as a latter-day foe of big business, Nazism, and Jim Crow.\n\nProclaiming \"Communism Is Twentieth Century Americanism,\" party leaders increasingly paired Lincoln with black abolitionists including Frederick Douglass , Harriet Tubman , and Sojourner Truth. James W. Ford, the first African American to be nominated for vice president on a national party ticket, explained that the memories of Lincoln and John Brown were crucial to any interracial working-class movement because they best symbolized \"the unity of Negro and white people.\"\n\nGeneral Secretary Earl Browder put theory to practice in his speech entitled \" Lincoln and the Communists ,\" delivered before an audience of coal miners in Springfield on Lincoln's birthday 1936, where he called on workers to revive the \"great tradition\" of the abolitionists to counter the new threat of pro-property reaction. Although Browder acknowledged that Lincoln may not have understood the problems of the 1930s, he nevertheless opposed consolidated and arbitrary power and \"foresaw the sharpening of the conflict between labor and capital.\" Lincoln was not a revolutionist, Browder conceded, but revolution remained \"the essence\" of Lincoln memory.\n\nLincoln became within Popular Front culture as an emblem of black civil rights that spoke to nonblack workers, as well as an avatar for the \"common man\" (often coded as white) that appealed to racially oppressed people. He was central to the flexible memory politics that pervaded Communist-influenced organizations, including the National Negro Congress and the Southern Negro Youth Conference, as party rolls jumped from roughly twenty-six thousand in 1934 to eighty-five thousand in 1939. While members of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade battled fascists in Spain, Communists at home arranged Lincoln-Lenin Memorial Meetings. Popular Front art such Paul Robeson's Ballad for Americans depicted the Illinoisan as a foe of both class and racial injustice, his conviction that \"a man in white skin can never be free while his black brother is in slavery\" echoing Marx's famous adage .\n\nLincoln remained a powerful leftist symbol through the civil rights movement. Building off Robeson's and Marian Anderson's wildly successful use of Lincoln's image, civil rights unionists A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin envisioned the Lincoln Memorial as the central site for both the 1941 March on Washington Movement and the 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom, the forerunners to the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom , which marked the one-hundredth anniversary of emancipation.\n\nIn recent decades, the Lincoln myth has lurched rightward, along with US politics as a whole. Today, we frequently get a neoliberal Lincoln more committed to \"diversity\" and \"equality of opportunity\" than racial or economic justice. At worst, we find reactionary Republicans constructing Lincoln in their own party image, with a straight line supposedly running from 1865 to Fox News.\n\nThese developments may have drained Lincoln of some of his allegorical power, even among leftists. But only some. Lincoln imagery has continued to suffuse emancipatory movements from Pride to Occupy Wall Street to Black Lives Matter.\n\nBut where does history end and mythology begin? Lincoln was neither an abolitionist nor a socialist, and scholars have long debated how and if he thought about class relations.\n\nMarxist historians including Hermann Schlüter (1913), Anthony Bimba (1927), and Bernard Mandel (1955) insisted that although the early Republican coalition included countless abolitionists, socialists, and artisans who were drawn to the party's concern for the sanctity of labor, the party's was not a class-based movement. And although these historians acknowledged that Lincoln was, in Mandel's words, \"much more liberal in his attitude toward labor than were many employers and newspapers,\" they also argued that he lacked a strong grasp of workingmen's issues. The railroad attorney from Illinois saw himself as a member of the petite bourgeoisie, they claimed, and as a \" free-labor \" advocate, he denied the very existence of a permanent wage-earning class with its own particular set of interests. Eric Foner , too, posits that Lincoln, like the abolitionists, understood slavery not as a class relationship, but as primarily a form of illegitimate power exercised by one individual over another.\n\nWould Lincoln's sincere hatred of the Slave Power have translated after the war to a critique of the Money Power and other forms of wealth-based domination? Would Lincoln have expanded or attempted to restrain his party's democratic impulses in non-wartime conditions?\n\nFor the vast majority of leftist memory-makers, such questions have been of secondary importance. To be sure, post-Civil War Republicans moved away from the \" abolition-democracy \" of Charles Sumner, Thaddeus Stevens, and Frederick Douglass, and increasingly aligned with capital by the 1870s and 1880s. But part of the Lincoln myth remained frozen in April 1865, ensconced within the party's more egalitarian origins. As Karl Marx suggested in 1862 , although Lincoln was not a revolutionary, this \"single-minded son of the working class\" was destined to become part of a radical tradition owing to his role in the \"revolutionary\" project of emancipation.\n\nPut simply, Lincoln's class position or unformed views on an undeveloped industrial capitalist system have typically been seen as less important than how his emancipationist heritage could be harnessed to animate contemporary struggles. Collective memory isn't scientific. It is, to a great degree, usable - the past in the service of the present. Generations of leftists have therefore rightly celebrated Lincoln's instrumental role in the emancipation of over four million enslaved people, which resulted in the largest liquidation of private property assets and the greatest relative redistribution of income in US history.\n\nOf course, the influence of this workerist Lincoln is only as powerful as workers themselves. Because the stories we tell about the past are reflections of who wields authority in the present, the popularity of Lincoln as a working-class ally, a proto-socialist, or even a revolutionary has always been predicated on social power, ebbing and flowing in direct relation to drops and surges in labor militancy.\n\nIn a short essay published on the eve of the Civil War centennial in 1956, historian David Donald argued that every national politician has to, at some point, \" get right with Lincoln .\" By this Donald meant that it benefits any group who hopes to engage a broad swath of Americans to align their cause with an avatar of human freedom. Although he rejected a \"Great Man\" view of history, Eugene Debs understood the power of the Lincoln imaginary, including how Lincoln as a symbol - residing in the gray area between history and myth - might broaden the workers movement and strengthen the cause of labor.\n\nIn summoning Lincoln's words and images to fuse labor and civil rights into a \"new abolitionist\" memory for interracial working-class democracy, the US left has been engaged in that process of \"getting right\" for well over a century. The praxis of popular memory is like walking a tightrope - between transformation and tradition, and between mass appeal and staying true to a socialist vision. But as long as the Civil War era remains, in the words of Eric Foner, an \" unfinished revolution ,\" the Lincoln metaphor is sure to hold currency among workers. In that sense, Abraham Lincoln - or at least the associated legacies embraced by Marx, Debs, and King - must belong to the Left.\n\nMatthew E.

Not because it was nationalistic, xenophobic, or isolationist but because it focused largely on domestic political questions: Medicare for All, student debt cancellation, and police racism and violence, among others.\n\nOctober 7 changed this overnight. Since last fall, the overwhelming focus of the US left has been on protesting the US government's deep complicity in Israel's murderous retaliation against Palestinians. One of the biggest stories in American politics today is the wave of protest and repression that has swept university campuses and that seems poised to affect the outcome of this fall's presidential election. Commencement day has already arrived for many students, but one thing seems clear - summer vacation will not end the movement in solidarity with the Palestinian people.\n\nThe Palestine solidarity movement raises a set of larger questions that the new left has yet to address. What is the meaning of internationalism today? What should socialist internationalism look like in an increasingly multipolar era? Would a multipolar world be more peaceful and progressive or just the latest version of great-power geopolitics? Jacobin contributing editor Chris Maisano recently spoke with three leading practitioners of internationalism on the US left - Phyllis Bennis, Bill Fletcher Jr, and Van Gosse - about their experiences in this field and their views of what it means to be an internationalist in the twenty-first century.\n\nWhat was your path to internationalist politics?\n\nFor me, it was a matter of timing. I graduated high school in the big year of the anti-Vietnam War movement, which was 1968. If you went to college or were around universities, it was hard not to get pulled into antiwar stuff.\n\nThe draft played a huge role in that because people were directly affected. But it wasn't only that; it was also a moment of what we would now call intersectionality. This was the height of the black student uprisings where I was in school in California. There was also a Latino student mobilization, and the student-rights issues were all over the place. The cops were on campus every other week, and the responses were dramatic.\n\nI spent my childhood and youth as a hardcore Zionist - I suppose that's a perverse kind of internationalism in a way. But I left all that stuff behind and went off to work on Vietnam.\n\nSeveral years later, after studying imperialism and colonialism - because that's what you did if you were a young lefty in those days - I realized this Israel stuff I always assumed was correct no longer sounded right. I went to my father's library and read Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism, and found his letters to Cecil Rhodes where Herzl asked Rhodes for his support because, as he put it, their projects were \"both something colonial.\" That was that, and I started looking at Palestinian rights.\n\nIt was definitely the Vietnam antiwar movement for me. My parents were academics in a typical college town, and it came up as the thing that was happening there. When I was ten, in 1968, my older brother explained to me that what the Vietnamese were doing was like what the Americans had done in 1776. They were fighting for their freedom as a country, and they were on the right side, and it suddenly made total sense.\n\nI got involved in antiwar politics as a boy - I went to the Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam with my mother. I was in New York City at that point, and if you were in New York City in the late 1960s or early '70s the antiwar movement was all around you. There was a lot of electoral work too, like the George McGovern campaign in 1972.\n\nIn 1982, I got involved in El Salvador solidarity and stayed in that for thirteen years. That was really the formative thing for me, but everything was shaped by Vietnam.\n\nI've been interested in international issues since I was very young, like nine or ten years old. I was very influenced by anti-communist propaganda in connection with the Vietnam War. Then in 1965, the United States invaded the Dominican Republic (DR). I had an uncle who had been a member of the Communist Party; after the Dominican Republic invasion, he came over to my great-grandmother's house, where I was for some reason, and he was furious about it in a way you rarely see when something is not happening to someone personally. This shook me and shook my backward views.\n\nThat incident in connection with the DR left an impression on me that worked its way around in my head. A couple of years later, I read The Autobiography of Malcolm X , and that was the defining moment in terms of who I was to become and what I wanted to do. Malcolm's internationalism was very influential on me, and subsequently I became very close to the Black Panther Party. I became very involved in Vietnam work and issues around Africa.\n\nThe post-9/11 antiwar movement was very formative for me. I was in college when 9/11 happened, and I very quickly threw myself into antiwar organizing with my friends on campus. The three of you were involved in founding United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ), which organized a number of very big antiwar demonstrations that I went to and remember quite well. What was your motivation for starting the group, and what in your estimation did it accomplish?\n\nDuring the Vietnam antiwar movement, there was a broad movement that was basically saying, \"Get the troops out, the US should not be there, the US should stop intervening,\" and so on. Then there was a smaller core within that movement who said the Vietnamese are right. The chant was, \"One side's right, one side's wrong, we're on the side of the Vietcong.\" It clearly identified with the National Liberation Front and the North Vietnamese. That was never a major component of the antiwar movement in terms of its numbers, but it was central to building the movement.\n\nDuring the first Gulf War in the early 1990s, there was a similar situation. I was in the middle of one of the big antiwar coalitions, the precursor to UFPJ ten years later. We thought there was nothing progressive about the Iraqi government, which had actually been supported by the United States for many years - but others did, which was why there were two coalitions at the time.\n\nThe same split happened again ten years later. We thought US troops should get out of the Middle East, but we also recognized there were huge human rights issues in countries like Iraq. In the case of the Vietnamese, unlike Iraq, [the National Liberation Front and North Vietnam] were fighting for a kind of progressive social program. They didn't do it well all the time, but it was a set of principles we believed in too. That was true in the Central American wars and in the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. But it was not the case in the first Gulf War or the Iraq War or the Afghanistan war.\n\nThe day after 9/11, some of us met at the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) and started talking about how a disastrous war was inevitably coming and how it was going to shape the next political period. We thought that what was needed after the attacks was justice, not vengeance. So we initiated a statement called \"Justice, Not Vengeance\" and worked with Harry Belafonte and Danny Glover to get other high-profile people to sign it.\n\nOur sense was that the American people were not being given any other options for how to respond to such a horrific crime. They were not being told that there were options other than war. The government and the media told the American people, either we go to war or we let the perpetrators get away with it. This was the context in which the three of us and a bunch of other people came together to form UFPJ.\n\nI was on vacation in the summer of 2002. One day it really hit me that George W. Bush was going to take us to war - that it wasn't just rhetoric. So I got on the phone with Van and I said, what the hell? What are we going to do?\n\nVan went to work on this, and we both started thinking about people to bring together. Some efforts had already been started; Medea Benjamin had put together a website that was called United for Peace. Then, on October 25, 2002, we founded UFPJ. It was the broadest of the antiwar coalitions. It was very anti-sectarian, which distinguished it from ANSWER [Act Now to Stop War and End Racism]. We did some remarkable work, and the work that led to the February 15, 2003, global march against the war was amazing.\n\nThe work was so good that we missed some important things that we should have been thinking about, like how difficult it is to stop a ruling class from pulling the trigger unless there are real fractures and divisions within that ruling class. We also didn't have much in the way of a strategy for what to do after the war started.\n\nI was organizing director of Peace Action for five years, from 1995 to 2000. We did some good work, but there was a kind of political abstentionism going on in the peace movement after the Cold War, in the sense that none of the national peace organizations was prepared to call for full-on national mobilization. There was lobbying, \"dear colleague\" letters, and what have you.\n\nANSWER walked into that vacuum. That was extremely problematic because it meant when you wanted to protest the bombing of Kosovo, you went to a demonstration where there were people with big photos of Slobodan Milošević. I don't want to be marching with Milošević photos. By the spring of 2002, it was clear that the United States wanted to go to war in Iraq. I remember thinking, are we really only going to have a narrow, sectarian coalition? A coalition in name only, really; there was no national organization in it.\n\nWe didn't have a strategy. We were just desperately trying to stop the war. I remember Phyllis saying to us at a meeting that we had a chance to stop it, and I think we did. What nobody seems to remember is that around 60 percent of the House Democratic caucus voted against the Authorization for the Use of Military Force, and almost a majority of the Democratic caucus in the Senate did. The potential was there; there was nothing like lockstep support for war in Vietnam after the Gulf of Tonkin incident.\n\nThe origins of that February 15, 2003, protest were not with UFPJ - it came out of the global justice movement in Europe, particularly the European Social Forum meeting in Italy that happened in November 2002. There were two or three thousand people crammed into the meeting place.\n\nThey were not mainly antiwar people; it was basically people from the anti-corporate globalization movement, which was on a roll at that point. That movement pivoted to focus on stopping this war. That was an incredible moment. UFPJ was pulled into that as the clear US counterpart to the Europeans and the Asian contingents that were part of it. There was less participation in planning from Africa and Latin America, but it was quite international when it took place.\n\nWhat I regret the most, in some ways, is we didn't recognize sooner that it was not a failure. Mobilizing fifteen million people in eight hundred cities around the world on one day was going to have an impact in the future, and we couldn't anticipate exactly what that would look like at the time. But we know now that it's one of the big reasons why Bush did not go to war against Iran in 2007. It's one of the things that gave rise to the leadership of the Arab Spring and the Occupy movement. Protests almost never win the exact demand they're fighting for now, but they set the stage for future mobilization, and we didn't recognize that enough.\n\nBill and Van, some years ago you wrote an essay called \" A New Internationalism .\" In that essay, you argued:\n\nIn the second decade of the 21st century, however, our practice of internationalism is confused and stuck in old habits and discourses left over from the era of Third World liberation, beginning early in the twentieth century, and the Cold War of 1945-1991.\n\nWhat did you mean by that, and do you still think this is the case?\n\nA rift has developed within the global left and progressive movements around international issues and authoritarianism. In 2002 or 2003, there was massive repression in Zimbabwe under then president Robert Mugabe. All kinds of dissidents were being jailed. Trade unionists, including people that I knew personally, were jailed and tortured.\n\nI had become the president of TransAfrica Forum (2002) and was in the leadership of the Black Radical Congress (BRC) around this time. The BRC's coordinating committee discussed the Zimbabwe repression. An organization called Africa Action put out a sign-on letter protesting the repression in Zimbabwe; the letter came to us in the BRC, and the coordinating committee unanimously said, let's sign onto this on behalf of the BRC.\n\nLordy, did all hell break loose. It became clear there was a whole section of the organization that was defiantly pro-Mugabe, which took the position that Mugabe was right to carry out this repression against alleged counterrevolutionaries, completely ignoring the neoliberal economic policies his government was carrying out. The coordinating committee had made a mistake in assessing what was going on within the organization.\n\nBut separate from that was the difference that was emerging about what constitutes internationalism, and how you deal with contradictions within countries that claim to be anti-imperialist, or at a minimum, anti-United States. It was a shock to the system for me, and at that point I realized the Left was in a whole new ball game - that we were going to have to rethink how we approach the global situation.\n\nWe had a similar debate at IPS about Zimbabwe, but we didn't have a project at that point dealing with African policy so it wasn't as sharp. But we're seeing it now around Nicaragua and around Venezuela, and it's no easier.\n\nI have my own criticisms of what governments that I once supported when they were liberation movements are doing now, and I am not so happy about them now. But I'm not there. It's not my place to be organizing against what the Vietnamese, for example, have done over the years in terms of labor rights or environmental concerns. But we certainly don't defend it, and we do call it out. I still think our main work is challenging what our government is doing - but as internationalists we do recognize other governments' human rights or other violations as well, and at times join with social movements in other countries to fight back against those violations.\n\nIt goes to the question of what we say about what our government is doing. One thing that's hovering over this is our differences around Ukraine, which are less about what happened or what's happening there than what the US government does about it. That is, I think, a more useful area of contention and debate within the Left, because people can have all kinds of different views about history and about who's on what side.\n\nThere is still this reflexive mode of thinking you should be on the side of whoever the United States is opposed to. It's crude thinking, and I felt it long before the Ukraine crisis. I remember talking to you, Bill, in 2002 or 2003 about the Taliban and Afghanistan, and you said the Taliban is a form of clerical fascism, and I thought that's getting right at it.\n\nThere's an idea dating from the twentieth century that anti-imperialism is necessarily on the Left or progressive, and that's inaccurate historically. Plenty of anti-imperialism has come from the Right - from traditional power holders, warlords, religious leaders who have been displaced by the modern imperialists and are going to fight back.\n\nThis requires a certain kind of analysis of what is actually going on. It doesn't mean you take the side of the imperialists. But that inability to name what the Taliban actually was was striking. Many of these people, whether the Taliban or Saddam Hussein or others, had been supported by the United States at one point or another.\n\nThe idea that the \"enemy of my enemy is my friend\" discredits us as a left. I remember sitting in a living room in 1973 or '74 with a representative from the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in Angola who gave an incredible Marxist analysis of the struggle there and of what he claimed UNITA stood for, and his criticism of many other movements within the continent in terms of what they were doing.\n\nMost of us were very familiar with the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, the MPLA, which was seen by us as problematically pro-Soviet. When UNITA emerged, many of us thought it was great. But then we found out that the story behind UNITA was a lot more complicated, including a mixture of legitimate revolutionaries with Portuguese agents and with tribalist forces in Angola. In fact, the guy that I met was later executed by Jonas Savimbi.\n\nWhen it came to the Khmer Rouge, at the time many of us [thought] that the situation couldn't have been that bad. Many of us refused to acknowledge what was going on. What that all taught me was the need for humility, and the need to investigate. I've seen countless people visiting the United States from alleged national liberation or left groups, and they say all the right things. But it's not clear who they are, and you can easily jump to conclusions. We need to be prepared to do a concrete analysis and be willing to admit when we just don't know.\n\nGoing back to when the repression went down in Zimbabwe, I remember having a discussion with this younger African American guy about it, and he was giving me the whole routine about Mugabe's alleged anti-imperialism. I said, but they're torturing people; I know people that are being tortured. What do you have to say about that? And this guy had no way of responding to it. That told me a lot about some of the deep weaknesses within the Left.\n\nI had different kinds of experiences that led me to some of the same concerns around Vietnam. I was in Vietnam at the end of 1978, and it was just a couple of years after the war ended. Vietnam was still devastated.\n\nThe process of integration between north and south was just beginning, and Cambodia was still pretty much in a civil war. It wasn't at the same level it had been, but the war was still going on. We began hearing strange rumors that the Vietnamese were thinking of going over the border and taking out the Khmer Rouge. I was there with an official delegation, and the Vietnamese officials who were with us assured us, no, that's not going to happen.\n\nWe accepted that and went home, but shortly after we got back, Vietnam invaded Cambodia and overthrew the Khmer Rouge. We were like, whoa, let's rethink all this.\n\nIt led to a sense that we need to be a little more careful. We had been hearing all this stuff about how terrible the Khmer Rouge were, and having the Vietnamese do what they did made those claims easier in some ways to accept because we still respected them so much. This kind of proved the claims about the Khmer Rouge to us, and it came at a time when it was hard to imagine how it could have been OK for the Vietnamese - who had always fought against China, Japan, France, and the United States for the notion of national sovereignty being primary - to overthrow another country's government.\n\nThe other place where these concerns come up is on the question of armed struggle. We know that a nation under military occupation has the right to use military force to oppose that occupation. It does not have the right to use that force against civilians. We all know how to spout that idea about armed struggle in principle, but it doesn't tell us when it's the right thing to do.\n\nThe Palestinians are the last population in the traditional situation of being occupied by the top rank of US imperialist allies. There's no question that a military occupation means they have the right to use military force, but that doesn't necessarily make it the right thing to do strategically. It's a different era now. We're no longer in an era where armed force is taken for granted as part of a global struggle against colonialism. There isn't an armed global struggle against colonialism underway around the world.\n\nIf we look at the difference between the First and Second Intifada, the Palestinian uprisings that began in 1987 and then again in 2000, what stands out was the mass character of the First - overwhelmingly nonviolent - Intifada. The Second Intifada was an armed uprising that did include a lot of military targets, but it had plenty of civilian targets too. The biggest impact it had on Palestinians, in my view, is that it eliminated the mass character of the First Intifada, because when people with guns come out, everybody else goes home because it's not safe. The children, the elders, the women who all played such a key role in the First Intifada had no role in the second one.\n\nMany of us in the boomer generation used to think that a legitimate revolutionary movement equaled armed struggle, and armed struggle equaled a legitimate revolutionary movement.  When you look at a lot of the splits that happened in the Left in the 1960s, they were precisely over the question of armed struggle raised to the level of principle, not over whether it was tactically the right thing to do in the given conditions. Is this what we really need to do, or are we saying that this is what one does if one's a \"real\" revolutionary? Many people did not move past that framework.\n\nThere is a growing strategic question being posed globally around what one does under very adverse circumstances, when there don't appear to be nonviolent options. That's why I think we have to be cautious about certain things that we say. In Myanmar, do the people have any option other than armed struggle? Probably not. In Kashmir, what should happen there? I don't know. How do you build an anti-occupation struggle when you have this semi-fascist government in New Delhi?\n\nThe twentieth-century left had a great deal of trouble acknowledging the dangers of militarism. There's a quotation from Che Guevara that nobody ever cites where he says that every other road must be explored before you turn to armed struggle. He said that - but we know how he set the completely opposite example with disastrous consequences. Foquismo didn't work, as far as I can see, anywhere, and it got a lot of people slaughtered.\n\nEven the most justified armed struggle is still going to leave some deep wounds; there's nothing positive about militarism. Violence will be inflicted on the innocent no matter what, and that's a political and moral-ethical issue that people should take seriously. [On that point,] I think Dr Martin Luther King Jr was a great revolutionary with great strategic sense.\n\nA lot of my thinking about this has been shaped by interest in and engagement with, from boyhood, the liberation struggle in Northern Ireland. There are people there who have a hundred or more years of history of unbroken anti-colonial struggle in their families. Seeing that, and the very negative consequences that have resulted from it, has taught me a lot about the costs of militarism. The Left has not really moved beyond the era of national liberation struggles, or ever really analyzed them and asked, what are the lessons to be learned?\n\nVan, I think your point about militarization is a good one. Many of the national liberation movements of the mid-twentieth century won power on the strength of armed struggle, and as you're saying, that has an effect on what comes next.\n\nThe means you use to achieve a political goal do a lot to shape the ends. In retrospect, I think it's fair to say that a lot of the governments that resulted from victorious national liberation struggles took that militaristic quality with them into government, whether you're talking about Zimbabwe or Nicaragua or wherever.\n\nI don't think the problems that many of these governments had when they emerged from armed struggle were principally because they engaged in armed struggle. There have been a series of problems about the question of democracy and democracy in transitional circumstances, particularly when you are moving from a former colonial regime or neocolonial regime into something else. How does democracy fit into this process? What does it look like beyond voting? Vanguardism and lack of humility can lead to a whole series of problems.\n\nFor example, Amílcar Cabral and a cohort of quite brilliant theorists and strategists led the struggle against the Portuguese in Guinea-Bissau. If you look at some of the writings from the war, you feel fairly certain that Guinea-Bissau is going to come out of this struggle and become a model for Africa. That is exactly what didn't happen. Cabral was murdered. There were contradictions that very few people wanted to talk about between the Cape Verdeans and the Bissau-Guineans. There was certainly a military element, but the military was largely kept under control by the party, at least during the liberation struggle. But there were underlying problems and fissures that the movement didn't tackle.\n\nThe other thing I would add is that if you think the leading force of a revolutionary change is omniscient, then you immediately run into problems about the contradictions between the regime or state that's put into place and the people they govern. In Grenada, the revolution that unfolded there from 1979 to 1983 had important and dynamic leadership in the New Jewel Movement. But it also had people represented by Bernard Coard, who followed a very Soviet model that saw the party as all-knowing.\n\nThey could not figure out how to build on democracy and recognize what the actual mandate of the revolution was. In Grenada, the mandate was anti-imperialist and anti-corruption. It was not a mandate for socialism. Coard ignored that and decided to plow ahead, irrespective of popular sentiment. So the mass organizations associated with the movement started running into problems and drying up. This was not mainly a problem of militarism - it was much deeper.\n\nBill, in talking about what a movement's mandate is, you've invoked a more fundamental issue in many ways, which is the legacy of Leninism. Leninism was the overwhelming political practice of people engaged in revolution. Even if they weren't socialists or Marxists, they were still Leninists. Vanguardism is what Bill called it.\n\nI think it does make sense to identify militarism as a challenge though - while certainly agreeing with both of you that it isn't the only problem. The role of armed struggle within a broader movement strategy is a hard one.\n\nI think the ANC [African National Congress] during the struggle period in South Africa did better than most at situating armed actions within a strategy with several different pillars, the most important had to do with mass mobilization. Armed action was relatively much less central than that. I'm not sure whether or how it was connected, but I don't think it's an accident that the ANC also had a strong strategy for mobilizing and building international solidarity. In fact, I think the openness of the South Africans working on building the case against Israeli genocide at the International Court of Justice to working with and taking seriously civil society is likely a reflection of that earlier strategic approach.\n\nIn addition to militarism, self-determination can be incredibly problematic when it's taken as an absolute principle by anyone who claims it, because it's ultimately about nationalism. Internationalism can get left behind.\n\nI remember when Yugoslavia was breaking up, I wrote a piece about the transformation of nationalism from an almost-always progressive force - which, in retrospect, it wasn't either - that existed largely in the Global South, in the formerly colonized countries, and was linked to socialism, anti-imperialism, and all the progressive ideas we supported. But suddenly all these new European nationalisms sprung up, micronationalisms if you will, that seemed to have no end.\n\nYugoslavia divided, violently, into seven small states. Within those states, there are \"nationalist\" movements. How do we define the right of self-determination in a way that makes it part of a struggle that makes people's lives better, and lifts up the most oppressed?\n\nI think what all of this points to is the question of what internationalism means today. This seems very unclear and very unsettled.\n\nSomething you hear very often on the Left - and it comes up all the time around Ukraine - is that our main job as leftists in the United States should be to fight our own imperialists. That is often used as a way of saying either that we should have nothing to say about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, or that we should do nothing to support the Ukrainian resistance even if we oppose the invasion.\n\nThere is an old slogan, \"Workers and oppressed people of the world unite.\" It is not \"workers, oppressed people, and progressive governments unite.\" It says workers and oppressed people of the world, unite. If that is your North Star, our attitude toward specific governments is secondary to the question of the people, the masses in various countries. Regardless of who is waving what flag, when there is oppression, when there is exploitation, our internationalism should put us on the side of the oppressed - as opposed to an internationalism that is mainly about geopolitical relationships between states.\n\nYou hear a lot of people today saying that we need a multipolar world. With all due respect, that is wrong. We need a nonpolar world. We've seen multipolar worlds. September 1939 was a multipolar world; August 1914 was a multipolar world. In fact, when you look through the history of humanity, most of the time there's a multipolar world.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1991, we had two superpowers, and that was fundamentally different, and then in the post-1991 period with US hegemony. The idea that having multiple poles creates better circumstances for peace and for freedom struggles and justice struggles is simply wrong. History does not back that up.\n\nOne of the most multipolar moments in European history, at least, was the nineteenth-century Concert of Europe. It was about great power cooperation to protect the status quo against democratic revolution.\n\n\"Multipolar\" is a polite way of saying a return to great power politics. Look at what that's already produced - there's nothing admirable about it.\n\nPolarities in this sense are certainly a huge problem. And it doesn't do any good to, for instance, expand the BRICS movement to incorporate wealthy and repressive Arab Gulf states into its ranks. It's kind of like the perpetual effort for United Nations reform that always seems to come back to adding more wealthy and powerful countries to the five permanent members of the Security Council: Should they have a veto like the Perm Five, or maybe only a temporary veto? Why do we need to expand the number of privileged powers, rather than trying to democratize power? That's a much harder challenge, I'm afraid.\n\nPhyllis Bennis is a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies.\n\nBill Fletcher Jr is a longtime trade unionist, writer, and former president of TransAfrica Forum.\n\nVan Gosse is a professor of history at Franklin & Marshall College.

The post-9/11 wars still raged but were met with no mass protests. Bailouts and recessions had met with little rebellion, either. \"In Why Fucking Bother?\" we envisioned perhaps an ongoing digital pep talk, as well as a serious analysis of our situation, convincing ourselves and others to stay in the fight.\n\nPeople responded eagerly, hungrily, to this project. They wanted to contribute, and to read about why to bother. Feeling defeated, they felt seen in those feelings - and wanted a way out of them.\n\nTypically, left-wing scholarly writing about social movements concerns strategy, tactics, material conditions. But increasingly we're seeing another realm of inquiry, one that probably matters just as much: feelings.\n\nFrom Enzo Traverso on left melancholy to the late Lauren Berlant on the \" cruel optimism \" of neoliberalism to Jodi Dean on comradeship to Sarah Jaffe on the politics of grief , left thinkers are beginning to understand that our emotions matter, and that these feelings drive our political actions and choices. Hannah Proctor's Burn Out: The Emotional Experience of Political Defeat is a fine addition to this literature and relatively unique in its specific focus on defeat.\n\nBorn in the wake of Jeremy Corbyn's defeat - which was emotionally devastating to many left of center Brits, just as Bernie Sanders's defeat was here in the United States - Burn Out explores the grief, trauma, and guilt of many survivors of defeated left movements, from the Paris Commune to twentieth-century Communism to feminist and revolutionary movements of the 1970s to the UK coal miners' strike of 1984-85.\n\nProctor seeks to interrogate the \"Don't Mourn, Organize!\" style of left discourse. She recalls that during the UK student movement, activists passed around Gillian Rose's book, Love's Work , with its epigraph from an Eastern Orthodox monk: \"Keep your mind in hell and despair not.\" Thinking of these words, Proctor writes,\n\nI felt so angry. If people have to live in the hellish world while seeking to transform it, can't they at least feel despair? What if it isn't possible to believe in salvation, in redemption? What if it's all too much to bear?\n\nA few weeks after we began soliciting content for \"Why Fucking Bother?\", the world answered our question: Occupy Wall Street began. Our project of facing and working through defeat no longer made sense. Like everyone else, we suddenly had plenty to do. In a real political moment, you do not need to ask, \"Why bother?\": it's obvious that we have so much to win.\n\nThat real political moment is still ongoing. Whereas in early 2011, there was no left mass movement in the United States at all, we then had Occupy, followed by the simultaneous rise of Black Lives Matter and the Bernie campaign (and Corbyn in the UK), the lasting democratic socialist revival, a renewed labor movement, and a Palestine solidarity movement. Each of those phenomena is intertwined, and I would guess that when future historians look at this period, they will see it as a time of growth for the Left, perhaps (we hope!) a time that led to some dramatic changes.\n\nThat said, we certainly have our share of defeats. They're emotionally complicated, because unlike most of the world-historical defeats that Proctor chronicles, they occur simultaneously with victories and new beginnings. A student encampment is cleared by the police; another one arises the next day. Socialists are elected to office even as Republicans flip blue congressional districts right nearby. Unions are busted, union drives are won. Union contracts are lost, workers strike and win concessions.\n\nWhat's also complicated is that even as we balance the emotions of victory and defeat, we must live in a society that, as Proctor notes throughout, presents a constant reminder that our side has not won nearly enough.\n\nNot only did Sanders and Corbyn lose, but Donald Trump and Trumpism is on the rise, and the regime that is currently in power, waging brutal wars and approving fossil fuel projects, generates headlines that offer 24/7 reminders that we are not. This is a recipe for despair, even as we are more engaged in organizing and action, en masse , than we ever could have imagined possible at the turn of last century.\n\nTo me, an emotional constraint of left movements has been a dearth of space for joy. I'm not alone in feeling this way. There was a reason Emma Goldman felt the need to assert that it was indeed appropriate for a revolutionary to dance (it turns out she never actually said, \"If I can't dance, I don't want to be part of your revolution,\" but as Corey Robin has written of other commonly misattributed quotes, such aphorisms say more about our collective unconscious desires than about the person being misquoted).\n\nBut fictional Goldman is right: we don't celebrate easily on the Left. When you win, your comrades must insist that your political victory is incomplete, or that it is, in fact, a defeat. Sometimes celebrating a victory can even be seen as a failure of solidarity, since, after all, most people are still suffering. Routine pleasures that apolitical people enjoy - everything from Christmas to organized sports - are viewed with suspicion.\n\nIf a fellow leftist asks, \"How are you?\", you are not supposed to say, \"Wonderful! I've fallen in love and also there are muskrats swimming in the pond.\" Instead, you might allow an, \"Okay, considering \" - considering all the horrible things that are always happening in the world: war, climate crisis, exploitation, looming fascism. All this ritual negativity sits atop the fact that the work of left organizing is demanding, not always fun, and can take time away from the joyful parts of life, whether that's time with friends, lovers and children, reading novels, or just sitting in the sun.\n\nThis is not the emotional elision that animates Proctor's book. Rather than prohibit joy and celebration, Proctor feels we don't talk enough about the despair and grief that accompany defeat - a huge feature of being on the Left in a capitalist world where we lose more often than we win.\n\nCommendably, Proctor wishes to depart from the usual left use of history, which is to find present-day inspiration in past victories or revolutionary moments. (Reading that, I felt seen and even subtweeted; I appreciated that she admitted she too had written such pieces.) Instead, she asks, what can we learn from the emotional experience of defeat?\n\nThere is a sense throughout the book that political participation foists upon us an optimism and can-do spirit that doesn't always feel authentic. Given pessimism of the intellect, isn't optimism of the will a bit forced? She quotes the radical poet Muriel Rukeyser, who wrote in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, \"that terrible time when everyone writes, 'hope.'\"\n\nGiven my own sense that the Left is always a bit melancholic, I was surprised that Proctor felt that defeated feelings were absent from left discourse. But as I read her absorbing study, I realized that activism foregrounds urgency and activity, often at a pace that encourages participants to push all emotions to the side besides a kind of forced optimism. The problem is that there has, historically, not been much room for any of our emotions in left movements. As Proctor writes, perceptively, \"psychological experiences require patience while so much in the world demands urgency.\"\n\nProctor doesn't say much about joy, libido, or love. When she does, she sounds a bit annoyed, as if too much has been made of these feelings at the expense of the more complicated emotions of defeat. But her intervention should prompt us to attend to all the feelings. I applaud this, but also sense that Proctor may be part of the last generation for whom this argument is a necessary intervention.\n\nYoung people's movements today are remarkably emotionally attuned. As Proctor acknowledges, left organizing WhatsApp chats are abuzz with references to solicitous check-ins (\"Does anyone have the capacity to...\") and open declarations of emotional fatigue, including the phrase \"burnout\" from which Proctor's book draws its title.\n\nProctor doesn't write much about climate feelings, despite extensive recent discussion of them. The climate movement is constantly debating the value of optimism (what the climate writer Mary Annaise Heglar has called \"hopium\") vs. \"doomerism.\" There is extensive discourse on \"climate anxiety\" and \"climate grief,\" sometimes discussed as impediments to action but also as radicalizing emotions or as problems to be worked through.\n\nMany are working on this collectively, too, with the insight that, as Proctor agues, the psychological and the social can't be neatly separated. Movement groups have also created \"climate cafes,\" in which people can talk about their feelings about the climate crisis. You could see all these conversations as a collective effort to grapple with the practical effect of decades of left defeat, which has resulted in the climate crisis, which is in turn contributing to a mental health crisis in our young people and many other people as well.\n\nIt may be that the climate movement has the right idea, in making space for all the feelings. The climate crisis is so depressing and scary, it's understandable that it would prompt an emotional evolution in our social movements. And not a moment too soon. Whether freeing Palestine, bringing socialism, or saving the planet for our kids, we are going to need our resilience - and we are going to be living through some very big feelings.\n\nProctor concludes that the psychological toll of these struggles \"should be acknowledged and can be mitigated,\" and are also inevitable. As well, paradoxically, they should not stop us from engaging in our complicated and difficult political moments, with our complicated and difficult comrades and selves. She ends with an exhortation from the great Mike Davis that is at once more realistic and more profound than the \"despair not\" or \"don't mourn\" platitudes so often foisted upon us: \"Fight with hope, fight without hope, but fight absolutely.\"\n\nLiza Featherstone is a columnist for Jacobin , a freelance journalist, and the author of Selling Women Short: The Landmark Battle for Workers' Rights at Wal-Mart .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Listening to the New York state senators kiss the ass of Governor Kathy Hochul's anti-choice, anti-labor, antiblack, pro-carceral nominee for chief judge of the Court of Appeals and the State of New York, Hector LaSalle, a neophyte could be forgiven for thinking the candidate was a shoo-in.\n\nBut when the Judiciary Committee took a vote on whether to advance his nomination, they voted no, ten to nine.\n\nIt was the first time in history that a governor's chief judge nominee had been rejected by the Senate committee, and a severe blow to the centrist governor's power in the legislature - especially given that it was her first significant political action of the year, after nearly losing to far-right challenger Lee Zeldin in November.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee's rejection of LaSalle was also an organizing triumph for a coalition of New Yorkers, including the New York City Democratic Socialists of America (NYC-DSA) and the Working Families Party, determined to end the era of right-wing judicial activism in this state and chart a broader progressive course for the state of New York.\n\nThe story of LaSalle's - and the governor's - defeat began two years ago, when a group of lawyers close to NYC-DSA organized to oppose then governor Andrew Cuomo's nominee for the Court of Appeals, Madeline Singas, who opposed progressive bail reform and had a history of rulings hostile to the rights of criminal defendants. Socialist state senators Julia Salazar and Jabari Brisport , along with colleagues like Gustavo Rivera, were outspoken in opposition to Singas. While the effort failed to stop Singas's confirmation, it put a spotlight on the political importance of these judicial nominations and showed that there was nothing mystically nonideological about the judiciary, nor was the power of the governor absolute.\n\nOut of that effort, the Center for Community Alternatives (CCA), a group that organizes against mass incarceration, built a coalition to advocate that the next chief judge should have a record that reflects certain progressive values, like defending the rights of workers, women, and people accused of crimes.\n\nThe process for picking a chief justice in New York is pretty wild. Candidates must apply; the governor can't just call upon any qualified New Yorker out of the blue, as the president of the United States can when choosing a Supreme Court justice. Out of the applicants, a commission gives the governor a list of those who are most qualified.\n\nFrom that list, the progressive coalition - which, in addition to the CCA, included many criminal justice reformers and labor groups - identified three candidates it could not accept and three that it could tolerate. Hector LaSalle was deemed particularly unacceptable. He was opposed by the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) Legal Defense Fund, for example, because he had once ruled that \"darker-skinned\" people were not a legally protected class.\n\nLaSalle was clearly a judge who would have served the boss class at the expense of the majority of New Yorkers, who are workers. One of his rulings made it easier for bosses to sue workers for defamation. In another, he interpreted Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations to protect only the worker, and not the worker's unborn child, from lead poisoning. He also denied a group of home health care workers the right to recover unpaid wages.\n\nIt was stupid of Kathy Hochul to pick an anti-labor candidate, considering that she certainly would not have won her recent reelection without the help of unions and the Working Families Party. That she then refused (and still refuses) to budge on this issue, an important confirmation but relatively minor in the scheme of issues on a governor's plate, is even more baffling.\n\nBut this nomination was an egregious own goal for her in another respect: after the Supreme Court last year gave millions of pro-choice Americans a reason to vote Democrat, and Hochul sensibly ran on that issue (and won only narrowly), she chose, in LaSalle, a judicial nominee who was at best uncommitted to a woman's right to choose abortion. Pro-choice groups came out against LaSalle because he had curtailed an attorney general's investigation into \"crisis pregnancy centers,\" organizations that use deceptive means to bully vulnerable women out of getting abortions.\n\nSeveral political developments helped organize the Senate against LaSalle. Socialists Kristen Gonzalez, Salazar, and Brisport were the first state senators to come out against his nomination, making it easier for their colleagues to do so. Probably most important in moving liberal to moderate Democrats to oppose LaSalle was the opposition of many unions to his nomination. The New York AFL-CIO, SEIU 32BJ, the Communication Workers of America, the United Auto Workers, and other unions made public statements, and in some cases even rallied and lobbied, against the nominee.\n\nThe governor is threatening to sue the state Senate to bring the nomination to a floor vote. But if she does that, she will probably lose. She will also drag out this deeply embarrassing saga even further in front of the entire state, at a time when she certainly does not have a strong mandate from the voters.\n\nThe saga shows what can happen when the Left works in broad coalition with liberal and left forces to take on hostile, centrist Democrat. Governor Kathy Hochul is going to have to find a way to work with a newly mobilized progressive coalition, who are not going to give her a pass on judicial nominations - or anything else.\n\nMeanwhile, that coalition of socialists, unions, reproductive rights advocates, and civil rights activists has learned a very important lesson: they can go up against the governor and win. Their constituent groups have proposed a wide range of legislative proposals that Governor Hochul has ignored or opposed, from good-cause eviction to taxing the rich. The question for them is how to use the momentum from this win to rack up further legislative victories for New York's working class.\n\nLiza Featherstone is a columnist for Jacobin , a freelance journalist, and the author of Selling Women Short: The Landmark Battle for Workers' Rights at Wal-Mart .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Stop Leftsplaining!\n\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/amirjina/2998335596/sizes/l/in/photostream/\">amirjina</a>/Flickr\n\nThis story first appeared on the TomDispatch website.\n\nDear Allies,\n\nForgive me if I briefly take my eyes off the prize to brush away some  flies, but the buzzing has gone on for some time. I have a grand goal,  and that is to counter the Republican right with its deep desire to  annihilate everything I love and to move toward far more radical goals  than the Democrats ever truly support. In the course of pursuing that,  however, I've come up against the habits of my presumed allies again and  again.\n\nO rancid sector of the far left, please stop your grousing! Compared   to you, Eeyore sounds like a Teletubby. If I gave you a pony, you would   not only be furious that not everyone has a pony, but you would pick  on  the pony for not being radical enough until it wept big, sad, hot  pony  tears. Because what we're talking about here is not an analysis, a   strategy, or a cosmology, but an attitude, and one that is poisoning  us.  Not just me, but you, us, and our possibilities.\n\nLeftists Explain Things to Me\n\nThe poison often emerges around electoral politics. Look, Obama does  bad things and I deplore them, though not with a lot of fuss, since  they're hardly a surprise. He sometimes also does not-bad things, and I  sometimes mention them in passing, and mentioning them does not negate  the reality of the bad things.\n\nThe same has been true of other politicians: the recent governor of my state, Arnold Schwarzenegger , was in some respects quite good on climate change. Yet it was impossible for me to say so to a radical without receiving an earful about all the other ways in which Schwarzenegger was terrible, as if the speaker had a news scoop, as if he or she thought I had been living under a rock, as if the presence of bad things made the existence of good ones irrelevant. As a result, it was impossible to discuss what Schwarzenegger was doing on climate change (and unnecessary for my interlocutors to know about it, no less figure out how to use it).\n\nSo here I want to lay out an insanely obvious principle that apparently needs clarification. There are bad things and they are bad. There are good things and they are good, even though the bad things are bad. The mentioning of something good does not require the automatic assertion of a bad thing. The good thing might be an interesting avenue to pursue in itself if you want to get anywhere. In that context, the bad thing has all the safety of a dead end. And yes, much in the realm of electoral politics is hideous, but since it also shapes quite a bit of the world, if you want to be political or even informed you have to pay attention to it and maybe even work with it.\n\nInstead, I constantly encounter a response that presumes the job at hand is to figure out what's wrong, even when dealing with an actual victory, or a constructive development. Recently, I mentioned that California's current attorney general, Kamala Harris, is anti-death penalty and also acting in good ways to defend people against foreclosure. A snarky Berkeley professor's immediate response began, \"Excuse me, she's anti-death penalty, but let the record show that her office condoned the illegal purchase of lethal injection drugs.\"\n\nApparently, we are not allowed to celebrate the fact that the attorney general for 12% of all Americans is pretty cool in a few key ways or figure out where that could take us. My respondent was attempting to crush my ebullience and wither the discussion, and what purpose exactly does that serve?\n\nThis kind of response often has an air of punishing or condemning those who are less radical, and it is exactly the opposite of movement- or alliance-building. Those who don't simply exit the premises will be that much more cautious about opening their mouths. Except to bitch, the acceptable currency of the realm.\n\nMy friend Jaime Cortez, a magnificent person and writer, sent this my way: \"At a dinner party recently, I expressed my pleasure that some parts of Obamacare passed, and starting 2014, the picture would be improved. I was regaled with reminders of the horrors of the drone program that Obama supports, and reminded how inadequate Obamacare was. I responded that it is not perfect, but it was an incremental improvement, and I was glad for it. But really, I felt dumb and flat-footed for being grateful.\"\n\nThe Emperor Is Naked and Uninteresting\n\nMaybe it's part of our country's Puritan heritage, of demonstrating one's own purity and superiority rather than focusing on fixing problems or being compassionate. Maybe it comes from people who grew up in the mainstream and felt like the kid who pointed out that the emperor had no clothes, that there were naked lies, hypocrisies, and corruptions in the system.\n\nBelieve me, a lot of us already know most of the dimples on the imperial derriere by now, and there are other things worth discussing. Often, it's not the emperor that's the important news anyway, but the peasants in their revolts and even their triumphs, while this mindset I'm trying to describe remains locked on the emperor, in fury and maybe in self-affirmation.\n\nWhen you're a hammer everything looks like a nail, but that's not a good reason to continue to pound down anything in the vicinity. Consider what needs to be raised up as well. Consider our powers, our victories, our possibilities; ask yourself just what you're contributing, what kind of story you're telling, and what kind you want to be telling.\n\nSitting around with the first occupiers of Zuccotti Park on the first anniversary of Occupy, I listened to one lovely young man talking about the rage his peers, particularly his gender, often have. But, he added, fury is not a tactic or a strategy, though it might sometimes provide the necessary energy for getting things done.\n\nThere are so many ways to imagine this mindset-or maybe its many mindsets with many origins-in which so many are mired. Perhaps one version devolves from academic debate, which at its best is a constructive, collaborative building of an argument through testing and challenge, but at its worst represents the habitual tearing down of everything, and encourages a subculture of sourness that couldn't be less productive.\n\nCan you imagine how far the Civil Rights Movement would have gotten, had it been run entirely by complainers for whom nothing was ever good enough? To hell with integrating the Montgomery public transit system when the problem was so much larger!\n\nPicture Gandhi's salt marchers bitching all the way to the sea, or the Zapatistas , if Subcomandante Marcos was merely the master kvetcher of the Lacandon jungle, or an Aung San Suu Kyi who conducted herself like a caustic American pundit. Why did the Egyptian revolutionary who told me about being tortured repeatedly seem so much less bitter than many of those I run into here who have never suffered such harm?\n\nThere is idealism somewhere under this pile of bile, the pernicious idealism that wants the world to be perfect and is disgruntled that it isn't-and that it never will be. That's why the perfect is the enemy of the good. Because, really, people, part of how we are going to thrive in this imperfect moment is through élan, esprit du corps, fierce hope, and generous hearts.\n\nWe talk about prefigurative politics, the idea that you can embody your goal. This is often discussed as doing your political organizing through direct-democratic means, but not as being heroic in your spirit or generous in your gestures.\n\nLeft-Wing Vote Suppression\n\nOne manifestation of this indiscriminate biliousness is the statement that gets aired every four years: that in presidential elections we are asked to choose the lesser of two evils. Now, this is not an analysis or an insight; it is a cliché, and a very tired one, and it often comes in the same package as the insistence that there is no difference between the candidates. You can reframe it, however, by saying: we get a choice, and not choosing at all can be tantamount in its consequences to choosing the greater of two evils.\n\nBut having marriage rights or discrimination protection or access to health care is not the lesser of two evils. If I vote for a Democrat, I do so in the hopes that fewer people will suffer, not in the belief that that option will eliminate suffering or bring us to anywhere near my goals or represent my values perfectly. Yet people are willing to use this \"evils\" slogan to wrap up all the infinite complexity of the fate of the Earth and everything living on it and throw it away.\n\nI don't love electoral politics, particularly the national variety. I generally find such elections depressing and look for real hope to the people-powered movements around the globe and subtler social and imaginative shifts toward more compassion and more creativity. Still, every four years we are asked if we want to have our foot trod upon or sawed off at the ankle without anesthetic. The usual reply on the left is that there's no difference between the two experiences and they prefer that Che Guevara give them a spa pedicure. Now, the Che pedicure is not actually one of the available options, though surely in heaven we will all have our toenails painted camo green by El Jefe.\n\nBefore that transpires, there's something to be said for actually examining the differences. In some cases not choosing the trod foot may bring us all closer to that unbearable amputation. Or maybe it's that the people in question won't be the ones to suffer, because their finances, health care, educational access, and so forth are not at stake.\n\nAn undocumented immigrant writes me, \"The Democratic Party is not our friend: it is the only party we can negotiate with.\" Or as a Nevada activist friend put it, \"Oh my God, go be sanctimonious in California and don't vote or whatever, but those bitching radicals are basically suppressing the vote in states where it matters.\"\n\nPresidential electoral politics is as riddled with corporate money and lobbyists as a long-dead dog with maggots, and deeply mired in the manure of the status quo - and everyone knows it. (So stop those news bulletins, please.) People who told me back in 2000 that there was no difference between Bush and Gore never got back to me afterward.\n\nI didn't like Gore, the ex-NAFTA-advocate and pro-WTO shill, but I knew that the differences did matter, especially to the most vulnerable among us, whether to people in Africa dying from the early impacts of climate change or to the shift since 2000 that has turned our nation from a place where more than two-thirds of women had abortion rights in their states to one where less than half of them have those rights. Liberals often concentrate on domestic policy, where education, health care, and economic justice matter more and where Democrats are sometimes decent, even lifesaving, while radicals are often obsessed with foreign policy to the exclusion of all else.\n\nI'm with those who are horrified by Obama's presidential drone wars , his dismal inaction on global climate treaties, and his administration's soaring numbers of deportations of undocumented immigrants. That some of you find his actions so repugnant you may not vote for him, or that you find the whole electoral political system poisonous, I also understand.\n\nAt a demonstration in support of Bradley Manning this month, I was handed a postcard of a dead child with the caption \"Tell this child the Democrats are the lesser of two evils.\" It behooves us not to use the dead for our own devices, but that child did die thanks to an Obama Administration policy. Others live because of the way that same administration has provided health insurance for millions of poor children or, for example, reinstated environmental regulations that save thousands of lives.\n\nYou could argue that to vote for Obama is to vote for the killing of children, or that to vote for him is to vote for the protection for other children or even killing fewer children. Virtually all US presidents have called down death upon their fellow human beings. It is an immoral system.\n\nYou don't have to participate in this system, but you do have to describe it and its complexities and contradictions accurately, and you do have to understand that when you choose not to participate, it better be for reasons more interesting than the cultivation of your own moral superiority, which is so often also the cultivation of recreational bitterness.\n\nBitterness poisons you and it poisons the people you feed it to, and with it you drive away a lot of people who don't like poison. You don't have to punish those who do choose to participate. Actually, you don't have to punish anyone, period.\n\nWe Could Be Heroes\n\nWe are facing a radical right that has abandoned all interest in truth and fact. We face not only their specific policies, but a kind of cultural decay that comes from not valuing truth, not trying to understand the complexities and nuances of our situation, and not making empathy a force with which to act. To oppose them requires us to be different from them, and that begins with both empathy and intelligence, which are not as separate as we have often been told.\n\nBeing different means celebrating what you have in common with potential allies, not punishing them for often-minor differences. It means developing a more complex understanding of the matters under consideration than the cartoonish black and white that both left and the right tend to fall back on.\n\nDismissiveness is a way of disengaging from both the facts on the ground and the obligations those facts bring to bear on your life. As Michael Eric Dyson recently put it , \"What is not good are ideals and rhetorics that don't have the possibility of changing the condition that you analyze. Otherwise, you're engaging in a form of rhetorical narcissism and ideological self-preoccupation that has no consequence on the material conditions of actually existing poor people.\"\n\nNine years ago I began writing about hope , and I eventually began to refer to my project as \"snatching the teddy bear of despair from the loving arms of the left.\" All that complaining is a form of defeatism, a premature surrender, or an excuse for not really doing much. Despair is also a form of dismissiveness, a way of saying that you already know what will happen and nothing can be done, or that the differences don't matter, or that nothing but the impossibly perfect is acceptable. If you're privileged you can then go home and watch bad TV or reinforce your grumpiness with equally grumpy friends.\n\nThe desperate are often much more hopeful than that-the Coalition of Immokalee Workers , that amazingly effective immigrant farmworkers' rights group, is hopeful because quitting for them would mean surrendering to modern-day slavery, dire poverty, hunger, or death, not cable-TV reruns. They're hopeful and they're powerful, and they went up against Taco Bell, McDonald's, Safeway, Whole Foods, and Trader Joe's, and they won.\n\nThe great human-rights activist Harvey Milk was hopeful, even though when he was assassinated gays and lesbians had almost no rights (but had just won two major victories in which he played a role). He famously said, \"You have to give people hope.\"\n\nIn terms of the rights since won by gays and lesbians, where we are now would undoubtedly amaze Milk, and we got there step by step, one pragmatic and imperfect victory at a time - with so many more yet to be won. To be hopeful means to be uncertain about the future, to be tender toward possibilities, to be dedicated to change all the way down to the bottom of your heart.\n\nThere are really only two questions for activists: What do you want to achieve? And who do you want to be? And those two questions are deeply entwined. Every minute of every hour of every day you are making the world, just as you are making yourself, and you might as do it with generosity and kindness and style.\n\nThat is the small ongoing victory on which great victories can be built, and you do want victories, don't you? Make sure you're clear on the answer to that, and think about what they would look like.\n\nLove,\n\nRebecca\n\nAs in 2004 and 2008, Rebecca Solnit and her blue-state henchwomen and men will probably invade northern Nevada on election week to swing with one of the most swinging states in the union.

      "text": "J.D. Vance Endorsed Book That Calls Progressives \"Unhumans\" and Praises Jan. 6 Rioters\n\nJulia Nikhinson/AP\n\nDuring his acceptance speech at the Republican convention last week, Sen. J.D. Vance, the GOP vice presidential candidate, praised Donald Trump's call for \"unity.\" But this year, Vance endorsed a new book co-written by a far-right conspiracy-monger that calls progressives \"unhumans\" and claims they are waging an \"Irregular Communist Revolution\" against American civilization.\n\nThe book, Unhumans: The Secret History of Communist Revolutions (and How to Crush Them) , was written by Jack Posobiec and Joshua Lisec. Posobiec is a well-known alt-right agitator and conservative media personality who promoted the bonkers Pizzagate conspiracy theory. Lisec is a professional ghostwriter. And their book professes to be a history of communist and leftist revolutionary abuses over the decades-but with a twist. They claim, \"For as long as there have been beauty and truth, love and life, there have also been the ugly liars who hate and kill.\" And these \"people of anti-civilization\" have always gone by different names: communists, socialists, leftists, and progressives. The pair contend these folks-be they the Bolsheviks of Russia or the BLM activists of this decade-are better called \"unhumans.\"\n\nThe book is a far-right declaration of war that accuses conservatives of not understanding that the left cares only about one thing: revolution.\n\n\"With power, unhumans undo civilization itself,\" Posobiec and Lisec write. \"They undo order. They undo the basic bonds of society that make communities and nations possible. They destroy the human rights of life, liberty, and property-and undo their own humanity in the process by fully embracing nihilism, cynicism, and envy.\"\n\nIt's a hard-edged message. The foes of conservatism are not merely misguided souls pushing the wrong policies but people who seek to annihilate civilization. They \"rob\" and \"kill,\" Posobiec and Lisec maintain: \"They don't believe what they say. They don't care about winning debates. They don't even want equality. They just want an excuse to destroy everything. They want an excuse to destroy you.\"\n\nVance apparently found this Manichean view worthy of his endorsement, and he provided a blurb that Posobiec and Lisec have used to peddle their volume:\n\nIn the past, communists marched in the streets waving red flags. Today, they march through HR [Human Resources], college campuses, and courtrooms to wage lawfare against good, honest people. In Unhumans , Jack Posobiec and Joshua Lisec reveal their plans and show us what to do to fight back.\n\nThe book (with a foreword written by Steve Bannon) is a far-right declaration of war that accuses conservatives of not understanding that the left cares only about one thing: revolution to achieve total control. The unhumans aim to \"kill the people who have more\" than they do. As they put it, \"On a base level, unhumans seek the death of the successful and the desecration of the beautiful.\" They decry the far left atrocities of the past (the French Revolution and the communist revolutions in Russia, China, and elsewhere) and claim the same malignant force is shaping the present, noting that the \"chief institutions of consensus-making\" in today's society \"are controlled by radicals and infiltrated by unhumans.\" The book comes across as modern-day McCarthyism: This dark menace has infiltrated nooks and crannies across America, from the boardroom to the classroom to even churches. No surprise, Posobiec and Lisec have plenty of praise for Sen. Joseph McCarthy.\n\nIn their view, the dangerous unhumans are everywhere . The Civil Rights movement? Mounted by unhumans. Critics of hate speech? Unhumans. The Black Lives Matter protests? Organized by unhumans. In fact, they compare the BLM protests of 2020 to the terror of the French Revolution, noting, \"There is no way to reason with those who manipulate the have-nots en masse to loot and to shoot. They simply hate those who are good-looking and successful.\" (Yes, they wrote that.)\n\nVance's thumbs-up to Unhumans is an indicator of how deep his roots are within the conspiratorial alt-right.\n\nVance's thumbs-up to Unhumans is an indicator of how deep his roots are within the conspiratorial alt-right. The book features the conservative movement's paranoid allegations about Big Tech being in league with leftists to help pave the way for a fundamental reshaping of society. \"The terrible truth is that there is a distinct revolutionary movement we are witnessing in the modern-day West,\" the pair assert. And they have a fancy name for it: \"The Irregular Communist Revolution.\" Wokeness, of course, is a major element of this.\n\nAnd this bring us to the noble counterrevolution: January 6, 2021. Posobiec, who was part of the fraudulent Stop the Steal movement, and Lisec insist that the riot at the US Capitol was a \"lawfare trap\" sprung to \"destroy\" Trump's followers and \"make them an example to any other Republicans who want to get uppity in the future.\" They contend all was calm on Capitol Hill until guards \"fired on the peaceful crowd with nonlethal munitions and flash-bangs.\" They write, \"It was all a trap,\" and the \"insurrection hoax was used to begin a purge of Trump supporters from the military and from public life.\" The rioters were \"well-meaning patriots.\"\n\nPosobiec and Lisec repeat many of the falsehoods of the tin-foil right, including the claim that Trump had pre-authorized 10,000 National Guard troops and that assistance had been rejected. \"There was indeed an insurrection on January 6, 2021-against President Trump and his supporters,\" they proclaim.\n\nFinally, the pair argue that the right must adopt extreme and underhanded measures to defeat the unhumans: \"Our study of history has brought us to this conclusion: Democracy has never worked to protect innocents from the unhumans. It is time to stop playing by rules they won't.\" This means state governors, county sheriffs, and district attorneys must wage crusades against the unhumans. Elon Musk's war on political correctness must be supported. Unhumans in education and media must be publicly named and shamed. Law enforcement in red areas should target antifa, BLM, and NGOs affiliated with billionaire George Soros.\n\nDoes Vance believe that Democrats and progressives are part of a centuries-long march of unhumans looking to destroy civilization? Does he believe an \"Irregular Communist Revolution\" is currently being waged in America?\n\nVance has echoed Trump's insistence that the 2020 election was rigged and that the January 6 insurrectionists were unjustly prosecuted. He has also said that had he been vice president that day he would have recognized the phony Trump electors from states where Trump lost. But does he also believe that Democrats and progressives are part of a centuries-long march of unhumans looking to destroy civilization? Does he believe that an \"Irregular Communist Revolution\" is currently being waged in America and that conservatives ought to not follow the rules in combatting this supposed threat?\n\nI asked the Trump-Vance campaign these questions and whether Vance read the book before giving it a thumb's up. It did not respond.\n\nNevertheless, Vance opted to boost Unhumans . Considering Posobiec's notoriety, Vance could have guessed that this book contained extreme notions.\n\nThe book has also been extolled by Donald Trump Jr. (\"teaches us how...to save the West\"), Michael Flynn (\"exposes their battle plans and offers a fifth-generation warfare system to fight back and win\"), and Tucker Carlson (\"Jack Posobiec sees the big picture and isn't afraid to describe it\"). A publicist for Lisec has used Vance's endorsement of the work to whip up media interest in the book and secure interviews for Lisec.\n\nWith Unhumans , Posobiec and Lisec are attempting to dress up the right's long-running demonization of liberals and progressives with warped history and a heaping of fancy jargon, lumping all left-of-center action into a paranoid brew that depicts the right's political foes as diabolical monsters seeking to obliterate all that is good within the civilized world. Vance's approval of this dreck is yet another indicator of how this politician who once compared Trump to Hitler has come to embrace the extremism of the Trumpian far right.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Are Liberals Responsible for the Rise of Donald Trump?\n\nJohn Fitzhugh/TNS via ZUMA Wire\n\nFive-time Jeopardy! champion Tom Nichols 1 writes today about why so many people are attracted to Donald Trump. Nichols is a Republican, 2 but he makes it very clear that he deeply loathes Trump (\"hideous,\" \"narcissistic,\" \"creepy,\" \"stupid,\" etc.) and will never vote for him. So what's his take on Trump's popularity? Is it due to economic insecurity? Inchoate anger? Bubbling racism and xenophobia? Hatred of the Republican establishment?\n\nNah. He says Trump's rise is basically the fault of the left:\n\nTo understand Trump's seemingly effortless seizure of the public spotlight, forget about programs, and instead zero in on the one complaint that seems to unite all of the disparate angry factions gravitating to him: political correctness. This, more than anything, is how the left created Trump\n\nUh-oh. That's not going to go over well. For what it's worth, Nichols is clear that he isn't referring to garden variety political correctness, which is basically little more than avoiding terms that are obviously insulting or exclusionary. At worst, that stuff is annoying but well-meaning:\n\nToday, however, we have a new, more virulent political correctness that terrorizes both liberals and conservatives, old-line Democrats and Republicans, alike...The extremist adherents of this new political correctness have essentially taken a flamethrower to the public space and annihilated its center... Any incorrect position, any expression of the Constitutional right to a different opinion, or even just a slip of the tongue can lead to public ostracism and the loss of a job.\n\n...Gay marriage is a good example. Liberals wanted gay marriage to win in the Supreme Court, and it did. Leftists wanted more: to silence their opponents even after those opponents completely lost on the issue... I could reel off many other examples. When the New York Times tells the rubes that it's time to hand in their guns, when The Washington Post suggests that Jesus is ashamed of them for not welcoming Syrian refugees the week after a terrorist attack, people react not because they love guns or hate Syrians, but because their natural urge to being told by coastal liberals that they're awful people and that they should just obey and shut up is to issue a certain Anglo-Saxon verb and pronoun combination with all the vigor they can muster. And if they can't say it themselves, they'll find someone who will, even if it's a crude jerk from Queens who can't make a point without raising his pinky like a Mafia goon explaining the vig to you after you've had a bad day at the track.\n\n...For the record, I despise Donald Trump and I will vote for almost any Republican (well, okay, not Ben Carson) rather than Trump....But I understand the fear of being silenced that's prompting otherwise decent people to make common cause with racists and modern Know-Nothings, and I blame the American left for creating that fear.\n\n...How long this will go on, then, depends on how long it will take for those people to feel reassured that someone besides Trump will represent their concerns without backing down in the face of catcalls about racism, sexism, LGBTQ-phobia, Islamophobia, or any other number of labels deployed mostly to extinguish their dissent.\n\nThis is hardly a new critique. Conservatives have been complaining about \"being silenced\" forever. The only difference between Trump and the rest of the GOP field is that Trump's complaints are a little earthier than Rubio's or Bush's.\n\nStill, even if I think Nichols is overstating things, it's not as if he doesn't have a point. Even those of us on the left feel the wrath of the leftier-than-thou brigade from time to time. I don't generally have a hard time avoiding objectionable language myself because (a) I'm liberal, (b) I'm good with words, and (c) I write rather than talk, which gives me time to get my act together. But even at that, sometimes I cross an invisible line and get trounced for it.\n\nBut for someone without my advantages, I can easily see how it might feel almost impossible to express an unpopular opinion without tying yourself in knots. And let's be honest: We liberals do tend to yell racism a little more often than we should. And we do tend to suggest that anyone who likes guns or Jesus is a rube. And the whole \"privilege\" thing sure does get tiresome sometimes. And we do get a little pedantic in our insistence that no conversation about anything is complete unless it specifically acknowledges the special problems of marginalized groups. It can be pretty suffocating at times.\n\nFor the most part, I don't mind this stuff-and conservatives do themselves no favors by harping on supposed PC idiocy like the \"war on Christmas.\" But the reason I don't mind it is that I can navigate it reasonably well 4 and I mostly agree with the aims of the PC police anyway. People who have trouble with navigation obviously feel a lot more constrained. So while I don't really buy Nichols' argument-conservatives built the monster named Trump, not liberals-I do think he has a germ of a point. Donald Trump is basically telling ordinary people that ordinary language is okay, and since that's the only language they know, it means they feel like they can finally talk again.\n\n1 Okay, fine: He's also a professor of national security affairs at the US Naval War College.\n\n2 Former Republican, anyway: \"I'm a conservative independent and a former Republican. I quit the party in 2012 because of exactly the kind of coarse ignorance that Trump represents. The night Newt Gingrich won the South Carolina primary on the thoughtful platform of colonizing the moon, I was out.\" 3\n\n3 I included that second sentence only because it tickled me.\n\n4 Much of this I've learned from reading stuff by academics, who are the masters of acceptable language. As an example: If you were to call something \"black behavior,\" you'd probably get mauled. The solution? Call it \"behavior stereotypically coded as black.\" This accomplishes so many things at once. However, it's also phraseology that no ordinary person would ever think of. This means they literally have no acceptable way of expressing the original thought, which makes them feel silenced.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Today's Left Can't Afford to Ignore the White Working Class\n\nJohn Judis is an old '60s leftist who watched his generation's revolution burn out and die in a furious backlash, and he's worried that today's generation of leftists are making many of the same mistakes. In \"A Warning From the '60s Generation,\" he outlines the three biggest trouble spots he sees in today's revolutionaries:\n\nFirst, many on the left - and many more-moderate liberals as well - attribute Trump's victory in 2016 and white working-class reluctance to support Democrats entirely or primarily to \"white supremacy\" or \"white privilege.\" They dismiss flyover Americans who voted for Trump as irredeemable - even though there is evidence that many supporters of Barack Obama backed Trump in 2016, and that many Trump voters cast ballots for Democrats in 2018.\n\n....Second, the left is again dividing into identity groups, each of which feels justified in elevating its concerns above others....While activists focused on identity politics have, like their predecessors from the '60s, made perfectly reasonable demands - for instance, an end to police brutality, or equal wages for men and women - they have also made extreme demands that display an indifference to building a political majority. Some have backed reparations for slavery - an idea rejected by broad majorities of the electorate, most of whom are descended from immigrants who came to America after the Civil War. Other groups have demanded \"open borders,\" defying a majority of Americans who think the country should be able to decide who to admit as citizens and who will be able to enjoy the rights and benefits of being an American.\n\nThird, many of these demands and strategies are accompanied by a quasi-religious adherence to special language and gestures that echo the experience of the '60s ....At the Democratic Socialists of America convention I attended over the summer in Atlanta, delegates identified themselves on their name tags, and when they spoke, by their preferred pronoun (\"he,\" \"she\" or \"they\") and signaled their approval by twirling their hands. Someone who used the colloquial \"guys\" to refer to the audience was sternly rebuked. There were charges of \"ableism\" and of \"triggering\" due to loud talking. These kinds of moral stances are fine for a church congregation, but not for a political organization that wants to win a majority of voters. The reality is that 80 percent or more of Americans who wandered into such a gathering would think they were on another planet.\n\nSome of this might be overblown. I was surprised a few weeks ago when I was watching a bog standard CBS courtroom drama and one of the lawyers had a conversation with the judge about her client's desire to be referred to as \"they.\" CBS is the official network of heartland folks who are turning gray, so if they figure this is OK then maybe it's not as off-putting as Judis thinks.\n\nNitpicks aside, though, I pretty much agree with him. His main point is that his generation tried but failed to form a broad coalition that included the white working class, and that led to Nixon, Reagan, Newt Gingrich, and now Trump. If today's generation wants to succeed where his failed, they need to show some genuine understanding that the white working class-some of it, anyway-has legitimate economic grievances that are pretty similar to those of the college-educated urban dwellers who mostly lead the Resistance. A real lefty would understand this at a very deep, gut level.\n\nThis is probably Bernie Sanders' biggest strength: he really does want to build a wide political coalition. I think he has weaknesses that will prevent him from doing that, but he's at least showing the way. Regardless of whether or not you like him, the rest of us should pay attention.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "There's a Standoff Between Far-Right and Far-Left Groups in Portland. Trump Just Picked Sides.\n\nMultiple groups, including Rose City Antifa and the Proud Boys, protest in Portland, Ore., on June 29, 2019. Dave Killen/The Oregonian via AP\n\nThe city of Portland, Oregon, has been bracing itself for a showdown on Saturday between the Proud Boys, an all-male far-right group, and self-described anti-fascists, known collectively as Antifa . The face-off is expected at the \"End Domestic Terrorism\" rally, a far-right gathering with a stated purpose of getting Antifa declared as a domestic terrorist organization.\n\nIn a tweet an hour before the rally was expected to begin, President Donald Trump weighed in, noting that he was giving \"major consideration\" to naming Antifa an \"organization of terror.\"\n\nMajor consideration is being given to naming ANTIFA an \"ORGANIZATION OF TERROR.\" Portland is being watched very closely. Hopefully the Mayor will be able to properly do his job!\n\n- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 17, 2019\n\nIt was a curious decision, to say the least. The Proud Boys, a self-described \"Western chauvinist\" organization, has been designated as a general hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. It has organized a number of rallies in Portland over the last three years, and each of them have come with their attendant threats of-and at times, realized-violence: For example, several people were injured when the Proud Boys clashed with activists commemorating Pride Month in the city in June. Portland, a liberal bastion known for its progressivism, has been the chosen site for these clashes thanks in part to Rose City Antifa, the country's oldest anti-fascism group.\n\nThis Saturday's planned \"End Domestic Terrorism\" rally promised to be no different. Joe Biggs-a Florida-based Proud Boy, former staffer of the far-right conspiracy theorist site Infowars, and organizer of the rally, wrote \"DEATH TO ANTIFA!!!!!!\" in a since-deleted tweet. He also told his followers, \"Get a gun. Get ammo. Get your gun license. Get training,\" in another .\n\nAntifa is a diffuse group of leftists and anarchists who promote using violence to combat racist or fascist ideas. In confrontations with right-wing groups, its followers often wear masks, helmets, and other protective gear.\n\nThis isn't the first time the president has threatened this designation against Antifa. In July, Trump tweeted something similar , stating that Antifa was made up of \"Radical Left Wack Jobs.\" On August 7, just three days after nine people died in a massacre in Dayton, Ohio, Trump wrote that the shooter \"had a history\" of supporting Antifa, as well as 2020 Democratic hopefuls Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. CNN reported that a Twitter account that appears to belong to the shooter retweeted tweets supporting Antifa protesters.\n\n\"Meanwhile, the Dayton, Ohio, shooter had a history of supporting political figures like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and ANTIFA.\" @OANN I hope other news outlets will report this as opposed to Fake News. Thank you!\n\n- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2019\n\nBesides far-right activists, naming Antifa a domestic terrorism organization has been the stated goal of a number of Republican lawmakers. Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.), have introduced a congressional resolution to that effect.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "On Twitch, AOC and Ilhan Omar Tapped Into the Future of Left Politics\n\nJanuary 4, 2019 - Washington, District of Columbia, U.S. - Reps. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ, D-N.Y., left, and ILHAN OMAR, D-Minn., arrive for a group photo with Democratic women members of the House on the East Front of the Capitol. Omar is holding a Congressional Black Caucus jacket bearing her name. Tom Williams/Congressional Quarterly/Newscom via ZUMA Press\n\nEvery day on Twitter, the account \"Facebook's Top 10\" tweets out a list of pages that posted the top 10 performing links of the day. And every day is almost always dominated by conservative pages, with posts from Dan Bongino, Ben Shapiro, Fox News and others often holding multiple spots in the top 10. There's not a popular account that does the same thing for YouTube, but the list of most popular American political YouTubers also heavily skews right, with figures like Ben Shapiro, Steven Crowder, and Tim Pool, who each have over 1 million subscribers. (Crowder has over 4 million.)\n\nFor all the consternation among conservatives about being censored on social media platforms, that all suggests that their ideology is doing great online. Even on Twitter, which seen as more of a hub for the left, Donald Trump, his children, and the extended constellation of posters who support them enjoy large followings. The Amazon-owned video game streaming platform, Twitch, is maybe the only major online platform where conservatives haven't been able to build the same ideological stronghold.\n\nA 4chan, Gamergate brand of internet, troll conservatism is inextricable from gaming , but some of the largest political streamers on Twitch are liberals or leftists like the former Young Turks host Hasan Piker, who has almost 600,000 subscribers, BadBunny, who has over 150,000 subscribers, and Destiny (who occasionally veers to the right ) with over 550,000 subscribers.\n\nIn this regard, it made perfect sense for Democratic Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar to stream themselves playing Among Us, a multiplayer game where players work as a team to figure out who is sabotaging the crew of their spaceship, on Twitch to 400,000 viewers alongside Piker, Pokimane, and other popular streamers on Tuesday night. Their game play, and exhortations to the audience to vote, were being watched by mostly younger and largely sympathetic minds that have been primed by Destiny, Piker, and others.\n\nI spoke with Piker when I profiled Destiny (whose real name is Steve Bonnell) last year, who explained how he'd ended up on Twitch after feeling boxed out of other platforms where conservatives had established strongholds:\n\nI think the right-wing foothold on YouTube is very significant. They already have money interest backing these channels they already have like legitimate media entities backing up these like Stephen Crowders of the world. So it's, it's a really uneven field. So I was like, 'I can't even compete with this.' I'm just going to start somewhere else. So I went to Twitch.\"\n\nPiker added that he was concerned that this could eventually flip. \"Another reason why I don't really ever like to do media...do interviews on my Twitch stuff,\" Piker told me \"is because like I'm genuinely fearful [that they'll try to come to Twitch].\"\n\nThe communities that streamers build-up based on constant audience interaction and response are uniquely intimate and involved in ways that passively watching a YouTube channel or reading Facebook posts can't compete with. When I peered over Piker and Bonnell's shoulders while they streamed, I could see their followers reacting in real-time, organically acting in unison to unleash coordinated emoji responses. Piker and Bonnell would respond directly to their communities, in kind. When Piker and Bonnell talked about their community, they described it as having its own personality, and when I talked to their followers on their chats, they knew intimate details about their favorite streamers' major life events, pet peeves and day to day tendencies. That kind of deep relationship makes fans more willing to mobilize in favor of whatever you ask them to, whether that's to watch a politician stream or to text bank for a candidate. Those fans are likely even more willing to mobilize after streamers like Piker and others have spent months and even years championing leftist politics.\n\nPeople are always predicting the next technology that will reshape politics. Most don't live up to the hype. Ahead of 2016, the explanding live streamed video led some to christened it the Meerkat and the Snapchat election . But even as major platform made their own live stream apps, including Twitter's Periscope and Facebook's Instagram Live, live streaming seemingly had little to no impact on the election. The same went for Snapchat. Live streams from the 2020 Democratic primary sometimes just produced weird fodder that didn't seem to necessarily benefit candidates.\n\nBut as Politico 's Zach Montellaro pointed out, Ocasio Cortez's impromptu Twitch stream was probably this election cycle's \"single largest event to reach young voters.\" Twitch may not remake politics, but as long as it remains a place where progressive politicians can command audiences of that size, expect to see more Democrats there.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "As a Presidential Candidate, Cornel West Aligns Himself With Far-Left Radicals\n\nCornel West will appear at a forum on the war in Ukraine with Lee Camp and Claudia De La Cruz. Mother Jones illustration; Nancy Kaszerman/Zuma; Wikimedia (2)\n\nCornel West, the celebrity academic (formerly of Harvard and Princeton), fiery antiracism campaigner, and current Green Party presidential candidate, has a long association with the Democratic Socialists of America, having served as the group's honorary chairman. But as he campaigns for president, West is moving beyond the DSA and forging bonds with far-left activists who call for the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism, who support the Chinese and North Korean regimes, and who are associated with communist organizations and Russian state propaganda operations.\n\nWhat has brought West into this circle is his opposition to US military assistance for Ukraine. In July, he posted a statement on social media blaming NATO and the United States for having \"provoked Russia into a criminal invasion and occupation of Ukraine.\" He called the Russia-launched conflict \"a proxy war between the American Empire and the Russian Federation,\" and he slammed the Democratic Party as \"a party of war and Wall Street targeting Russia and China.\"\n\nWest is currently scheduled to headline a Washington, DC, forum on October 3 that aims to spur opposition to the Biden administration's support of the Ukrainian government's fight against the Russian invasion. Part of a \"global mobilization\" of self-described peace groups, the event is being co-sponsored by an outfit long tied to communist organizations, and West will share the stage with speakers from the farthest side of the left, including some who have worked for Russian state media.\n\nAccording to promotional material for the forum, the other participants will be Claudia De La Cruz, Eugene Puryear, Medea Benjamin, and Lee Camp.\n\nDe La Cruz is presently the 2024 presidential candidate of the small, far-left Party for Socialism and Liberation. The PSL split from the Marxist-Leninist Workers World Party in 2004, and one of its founders has declared, \"We are communists.\" The party calls for the \"revolutionary\" overthrow of capitalism and denounces \"reformist hopes\" for a \"kinder, gentler\" capitalism. The PSL has supported the North Korean regime and its pursuit of nuclear weapons and also hailed the Chinese Communist Party, defending it against various charges of human rights violations. Brian Becker, a co-founder of the PSL, used to co-host a show on Radio Sputnik, a Moscow-created propaganda network.\n\nPuryear, a co-host of the forum, was the PSL's vice presidential candidate in 2008 and 2016. He, too, once hosted a show on Radio Sputnik, which is the radio and digital outlet of Rossiya Segodnya (Russia Today), the Kremlin-controlled media agency that directs the RT television network. (RT America shut down shortly after Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.) Camp, a comedian and far-left podcaster, had a show on RT America until the cable network shuttered. He blamed the \"US government war machine\" for RT America's demise.\n\nMedea Benjamin, the other-co-host for the event, is a co-founder of Code Pink, a longtime opponent of US military intervention overseas. She is scheduled to co-host a fundraiser for West prior to the forum. Code Pink was the subject of a recent New York Times investigation that reported that this antiwar group has received significant financial support from a pro-China tech mogul named Neville Roy Singham who lives in Shanghai and that the group has defended or downplayed China's human rights violations.\n\nThe Times said that its reporters had \"tracked hundreds of millions of dollars to groups linked to Mr. Singham that mix progressive advocacy with Chinese government talking points.\" As an example, it noted that Code Pink \"once criticized China's rights record but now defends its internment of the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs, which human rights experts have labeled a crime against humanity.\" Singham, who is married to Code Pink co-founder Jodie Evans, also has funded the People's Forum, a New York-based meeting space that hosts radical left lectures and events and that De La Cruz and another PSL activist have co-managed .\n\n(After the Times article appeared, Code Pink, the People's Forum, PSL, Benjamin, Evans, De La Cruz, Puryear, Camp, Becker, and others signed an open letter accusing the newspaper of engaging in \"McCarthyism\" and joining with \"right-wing extremists\" to use \"intimidation tactics\" to smear Code Pink, the People's Forum, and other \"advocates for change.\" A spokesperson for Code Pink tells Mother Jones , \"We do not spread talking points from foreign governments.\" She adds, \"The notion that we are influenced by external political entities or governments is not only false-it's insulting. We've always been an independent voice for peace, and we refuse to be labeled otherwise... The Chinese government's violation of [the Uyghurs'] human rights is of concern to us and we join the call for justice for the Uyghurs. At the same time, we call out the US government, which is using the human rights of the Uyghurs as a tool to drive war with China, instead of a human rights issue that needs to be addressed as such.\" In a 2021 interview , though, Evans did seem to excuse or diminish the Chinese government's harsh treatment of the Uyghurs.)\n\nThe October 3 panel opposing US military assistance to Ukraine is sponsored by Code Pink, Peace in Ukraine (a collection of antiwar groups), and the ANSWER Coalition. ANSWER is an antiwar outfit that emerged in the run-up to the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 and was organized by the Workers World Party, a small political sect that split from the Socialist Workers Party to support the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. The WWP, an advocate of socialist revolution and the abolition of private property, praised the regimes of Fidel Castro and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il. It campaigned against the war-crimes trial of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. ANSWER's spokesperson at the time of its founding was Brian Becker, who went on to leave the WWP and form the PSL. He is currently the national coordinator of ANSWER. Last year, Becker gave an interview to Global Times , a propaganda outlet tied to the Chinese Communist Party, and hailed the CCP as \"a source of great inspiration for people who seek a socialist and humanist alternative.\"\n\nWith his participation in the October 3 event, West has allied himself with a small coterie of far-leftists, some of whom promote extremist ideology and some of whom have voiced support for authoritarian regimes or partnered with Russia-controlled media operations.\n\nWest and his campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nWest and his backers might argue that he is merely joining forces with those who also oppose US policies that he deems dangerous. Yet when a presidential candidate takes a stage, he or she can expect to be judged by those who share the platform. The current line-up for this forum places West in the company of radicals, Chinese apologists, and chums of Russia's propaganda machine. Given his status as a prominent public intellectual and academic, his headlining appearance boosts the standing of his co-speakers and the organizing outfits. Choosing to appear with these people is a significant campaign decision.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "When the Political is Personal\n\nConor Friedersdorf nominates me for combat duty:\n\nFolks on the right think leftists don't confront the indefensible speech uttered by their side. And vice-versa.\n\nSo why don't the folks at The Corner enter into a bargain with a prominent blogger on the left?\n\nWhat do you say, Matt Yglesias or Kevin Drum or Jonathan Chait? Here's how it would work. Every day for a week, Monday through Friday, The Corner's designated blogger could draft one post for publication on the left-leaning blog. The catch? They'd be limited to offering five direct quotations per day of lefties engaged in indefensible rhetoric, however they define it (in context, of course).\n\nIn return, the liberal interlocutor could publish the equivalent post at The Corner. And every day for a week, the participants would have to read one another's five examples for that day, and decide whether to acknowledge that they're indefensible and assert that the source should apologize if he or she hasn't done so... or else defend the remark(s).\n\nMaybe I'm wrong. But I suspect that Yglesias, Drum, and Chait would all be game for this sort of exchange. And that it wouldn't be approved at The Corner in a million years.\n\nNot a chance. On the list of things I don't want to spend my time on, this ranks very, very high. But if Chait takes him up on this I promise to read every day just for the entertainment value.\n\nOn a slightly more serious note, the real problem is that I don't think individual quotes here and there really prove anything. There are a lot of people in America, and that means that every day there are lots of people saying stupid things. Big deal. What matters is the overall tone, and here I think Harold Meyerson basically has it right:\n\nA fabricated specter of impending governmental totalitarianism haunts the right's dreams. One month after Barack Obama was inaugurated as president, Beck hosted a show that gamed out how militias in Southern and Western states might rise up against an oppressive government. The number of self-proclaimed right-wing militias tripled - from 42 to 127, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center - in 2009 (and that doesn't count those that are entirely underground).\n\nAs much of the right sees it, the government is planning to incarcerate its enemies [], socialize the economy and take away everyone's guns. At the fringe, we have figures like Larry Pratt, executive director of the Gun Owners of America, who told a rally in Washington last April that, \"We're in a war. The other side knows they are at war, because they started it. They are coming for our freedom, for our money, for our kids, for our property. They are coming for everything because they are a bunch of socialists.\"\n\nThis is obviously a lot harder to quantify. Are the fever dreams of the right worse than the fever dreams of the left? I'd say they obviously are, but that's a matter for evidence and argument, not listicles. But nobody on the right is ever going to acknowledge this anyway. They really do think of carbon taxes as tantamount to Stalinism and they really do think of national healthcare as a socialist experiment in starting up death panels for old people. I'm not even sure how you have a conversation about this stuff.\n\n....Noodling some more about this, there are, of course, doom merchants on both the left and right. There were people on the left who were afraid that Bush had turned us into a fascist country and that his national security apparatus was turning us into a police state. So what's the difference? I think the distinction I always come back to is that for right-wingers this stuff is so much more personal .\n\nWhat I mean by this is that, generally speaking, lefties weren't afraid that they personally were going to be rounded up in terror sweeps or sent off to war. They may have had strong views about these things, but (obviously with exceptions) their views were still fairly abstract: fascism is bad and police states are bad, but they themselves weren't really the ones who would suffer from it. It was others. And no matter how dedicated you are, you're never as passionate about other groups as you are about yourself.\n\nConservatives, by contrast, take this stuff very personally indeed. The government is coming for their guns, the government wants to kill their grandmother, the government wants to confiscate their money. Needless to say, this provokes a whole different level of frenzy. When you conceive of your political opposites as literally coming after you , it makes a lot more sense to take a very apocalyptic view of things. Thus, the popularity of Glenn Beck.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Donald Trump Has Made Socialism Cool Again\n\nA month after President Donald Trump took office, khalid kamau was eating lunch in the cluttered kitchen of the Mayday Space, a leftist community center in Brooklyn. A year earlier, the 39-year-old (who prefers to spell his name without capital letters) had been driving a bus in Atlanta. Then his life took a hard left turn. When the city slashed public pensions, he became a union organizer. He then launched a Black Lives Matter chapter, became a delegate for Sen. Bernie Sanders, and led a walkout at the Democratic National Convention when Hillary Clinton clinched the nomination. In December, kamau announced his candidacy for City Council in South Fulton, Georgia. Not long after that, he joined the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nkamau, who was wearing a black T-shirt that said, \"Don't let your new president get your ass whooped,\" had been a DSA member for all of a few weeks, but he already had big plans. Leaning forward on his wooden stool, he said, \"I want to be the Obama of democratic socialism.\"\n\nFirst, kamau needed to win an election. Which is why, on an unseasonably warm weekend in February, he had come to Brooklyn for the Revolution at the Crossroads conference, a gathering of about 300 teen and twentysomething leftists that was sponsored by the Young Democratic Socialists , a subgroup of the DSA. After speaking on the kickoff panel the night before, kamau had taught the attendees how to use the free canvassing app MiniVAN and signed up dozens of volunteers for his campaign. (His organizing paid off; last Tuesday, kamau won his runoff election with 67 percent of the vote.)\n\nFounded in 1982, the DSA claims to be the largest socialist organization in the country. It's not a political party along the lines of the Communist Party USA or the Green Party. Many of its members are Democrats or the kind of left-­leaning independents who usually vote for Democrats. But just as the Obama era ushered in a boomlet of libertarianism on the right, the DSA is banking on Trump to make socialism great again. Its goal is not just to stop Trump's worst policies, but to push the political conversation on the left even further to the left through a mix of political action and cultural engagement. There are signs it's already working.\n\nFueled by disenchantment with the traditional institutions of the Democratic Party, the promise of Sanders' candidacy, and the specter of Trumpism, DSA membership has more than doubled since the election. The DSA now boasts more than 20,000 members and more than 120 local chapters. Sure, you could fit just about everyone comfortably inside Madison Square Garden, but being a socialist hasn't been this cool in years.\n\n\"The Bernie campaign really opened that Overton Window,\" said Winnie Wong, a 41-year-old activist who co-founded the group People for Bernie and coined the phrase \"Feel the Bern.\" \"We funneled thousands of people, hundreds of thousands-15 million people!-through to the other side. Are those people democratic socialists? No. Do they feel comfortable with the idea of socialism? Well, yeah! Because they voted for it.\" Normalizing socialism, she said, is \"the most important thing we can do.\"\n\nRevolution at the Crossroads existed in a parallel universe to other political confabs, such as the Conservative Political Action Conference, known for its corporate sponsors, bad suits, and ritzy Beltway hotels. The opening panel was delayed because the speaker system was picking up an AM radio station. An attendee joked that \"neoliberal capitalism\"-\"neoliberal\" being the epithet of choice among the DSA set-was to blame. Sleeping bags littered the side walls. The dress code was plaid.\n\nSocialism's hipster makeover has been accelerated by a flowering of leftist media and culture. The DSA's unofficial hype man is not Sanders-who is not a member-but the comedian Rob Delaney, who joined up after the election, inspired by his positive experiences with the British National Health Service as an expat living in England. Delaney has tweeted about the DSA more than 100 times since November and describes himself as a \"fucking cockroach\" for socialism, because of his persistence. \"A lot of people have written me and said that they've joined because I won't shut up about Democratic Socialists on Twitter,\" he told me. He even raised money to defray expenses for some of the students who traveled to Brooklyn.\n\nA popular gateway drug for democratic socialists is Chapo Trap House , a podcast hosted by a small clique of millennial Sandernistas that takes its deliberately head-scratching name from the jailed Mexican cartel king. It is incisive and irreverent but often scathing toward politicians, journalists, or anyone else insufficiently in line with its politics. (For instance: Clinton is an \"entitled fucking slob,\" and Democratic leaders should have \"fucking killed themselves\" after losing the election.)\n\nOutside the conference, activists hawked Workers Vanguard , the ubiquitous Trotskyist newspaper. But inside, students chatted with writers from the two-year-old journal Current Affairs (\"the world's first readable political publication\") and Jacobin , a quarterly launched in 2010 by Bhaskar Sunkara, then an undergrad at George Washington University. Jacobin aims to do for socialism what National Review did for conservatism half a century ago. It's polemical but not stodgy; its writers are as likely to discourse on the NBA as they are to inveigh against Uber . The magazine's audience doubled, to 30,000 subscribers, in the four months after the election.\n\nAt the conference, where he was selling the most recent issue from a folding table along the wall, Sunkara, also a vice chair of the DSA, was a minor celebrity. \"I think there's a feeling that with the center kind of defeated, or at the very least temporarily discredited, we are the new center-left,\" he told me. That newfound popularity has caused him to rethink the limitations of leftist politics. \"Compared to where the goalposts were five years ago, we're already basically there,\" he said. Socialists won't run Washington by 2020-but maybe they will in his lifetime.\n\nBut the DSA's continued growth is hardly guaranteed. One challenge as it seeks to broaden its appeal is messaging. Members of the new socialist vanguard pride themselves on a certain degree of unfiltered vulgarity, and they target mainline liberals as often as they do Trump-backing conservatives. Amber A'Lee Frost, a Chapo co-host and YDS panelist, has referred to her cohort's style as the \"Dirtbag Left.\" Frost contends that rudeness is essential to disrupting the political status quo. It is, however, a weird way to make new friends. Coalition politics are hard when everyone else is a sellout.\n\nMore pressing than its inability to play nice is the movement's inescapable whiteness. If the audience at the conference was any indication, the DSA's future is doomed to demographic failure-a point kamau emphasized on the event's opening night. \"I want you to look around the room,\" he said, \"and then I want you to realize that we're in Flatbush, Brooklyn, right?\" It was Bushwick, but the point stood. \"I love Bernie, but I also think that the leaders of the Democratic Party and the leaders of the left are going to have to come to terms with the fact that the American left is a movement of black and brown people,\" he told me. \"And the leadership of the Democratic Party doesn't look like that-the leadership of the DSA doesn't look like that.\"\n\nIn South Fulton, a mostly working-class, African American community of 100,000 people, kamau sees an opportunity to broaden the appeal of democratic socialism. He believed his race, which was nonpartisan, was a chance to act on a DSA manifesto that calls for running \"openly democratic socialist candidates for local office, in and outside the Democratic Party,\" and \"taking out pro-corporate, neoliberal Democrats.\" YDS had given each conferencegoer a three-page reading list with titles by writers such as Karl Marx, Antonio Gramsci, and Barbara Ehrenreich. Wong suggested that young socialists study up on the hard lessons of electoral politics instead. \"Learn about the mechanics it takes to win these elections,\" she said. \"You're not gonna learn those by reading all three volumes of Capital , I promise you.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "With Trump in mind, some progressives online turn against anti-Harris leftists\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nMany young progressives who were hesitant to usher in another Joe Biden presidency now appear eager to cast their ballots for Vice President Kamala Harris - and they're turning against fellow leftists online who aren't on the same page.\n\nIn the days since Biden dropped his re-election campaign, progressive circles appeared to celebrate the news and rally behind Harris . But some left-leaning social media users were quick to criticize progressives' willingness to vote for \" a cop ,\" and some pro-Palestinian voters argued that Harris' foreign policy would be just as intolerable as Biden's.\n\nSoon, however, a slew of TikToks and X posts lambasted the narrative that Harris is on par with former President Donald Trump, listing out numerous ways that they believe a Trump presidency would be worse for marginalized communities at home and abroad. Many also criticized anti-Harris leftists' seeming inability to come up with a better solution, accusing them of performative activism .\n\nNew Jersey-based musician Charley Furey, 28, said he has been fearful about how a second Trump presidency might affect LGBTQ+ rights. He said he wept in relief when Biden - who was too moderate for his tastes - announced that he would step aside, because for the first time in a long time, he felt hopeful that a Democratic nominee could beat Trump.\n\n\"Certain leftists want a 100% morally pure option that doesn't realistically exist in our political system right now. I wish it did but it doesn't,\" said Furey, who also shared his frustration on TikTok. \"And it annoys me that rather than use their vote to make a difference in what ways they can, they throw their hands up and say screw the system. It's a cop-out and completely against what we on the left should stand for.\"\n\nProgressives have previously expressed disenchantment with the president's support for Israel's military campaign in Gaza, his climate policies and his efforts to ban TikTok , among other concerns. They've similarly criticized Harris in the past for her criminal justice policies as California attorney general and, more recently, for her seeming complicity with Biden's stance on Israel.\n\nIn the wake of the backlash, many online have circulated a viral quote by YouTube political and cultural commentator ContraPoints, uttered during her critique of leftist \"resentment politics\" in a 2021 video essay : \"They don't want victory, they don't want power, they want to endlessly 'critique' power.\"\n\nContraPoints, whose real name is Natalie Wynn, told NBC News in an interview that this has been a long-running tension among people on the left.\n\n\"What we're having is the same argument that we have every four years, which is: Is the Democrat good enough, or is it a horrible moral compromise to vote for this candidate who doesn't fulfill XYZ progressive morals?\" she said.\n\nWynn said she tends to be more progressive than the Democratic Party but has shied away from calling herself a leftist because of the \"online left\" - as many in this camp, she said, have not organized tangible change aside from running what \"basically amounts to a voter suppression campaign.\"\n\n\"Someone who becomes president of the United States inevitably gets someone's blood on their hands at some point,\" Wynn said. \"And I think people feel that if they don't vote, or if they vote for a candidate that they know won't win, then they never have to shoulder any responsibility for what the government does.\"\n\nX user @commodifythis is among the progressives who have criticized Harris voters online. The user, who requested anonymity due to an online stalker, describes herself as a longtime pro-Palestinian advocate and has drawn backlash for her posts stating she would not back Harris unless the candidate calls for a permanent cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nThe Pennsylvania resident, 28, said she doesn't buy into the \"lesser of two evils\" argument presented by Harris voters.\n\n\"Even if there's any weight to that argument, it's just not a convincing one for people who are on the fence. I think that people need a reason to vote for someone besides just that the other person is bad,\" she said. \"Because I think we are probably in agreement on that, but I need some kind of commitment from Kamala Harris to know that her presidency is going to address all of the things that would be bad about Donald Trump.\"\n\nBecause of her stance, she said, she has been hit with harsh retorts from other internet users in what she believes is an unempathetic and unconvincing response to her concerns.\n\n\"I feel like if I were them, I would maybe say, 'I hope that she adopts a position that will convince you to vote for her, and if she doesn't, I hope that there are other positions that convince you to vote for her instead,'\" she said, \"rather than insulting me or telling me that I'm privileged when you don't know who I am.\"\n\nFor many online, the renewed energy around Harris comes from the sentiment that the vice president is more palatable to both progressives and young people at large - making her appear much more electable than Biden.\n\nAmelia Kimball, a college student at the University of Texas at Austin who describes herself as strongly left-leaning, said she's hopeful about Harris' candidacy even as she remains critical of her. She said she believes Biden would have had next to no shot of defeating Trump this time around, especially after his fumbling debate in June and a recent assassination attempt that galvanized public support for Trump.\n\n\"Kamala Harris, just baseline, is younger, is more lively, can answer questions coherently and immediately. That's going to make folks more excited about her,\" Kimball, 21, said. \"I think that Joe Biden had just become so incredibly uninspiring that the bar really was on the floor in terms of what people would be more excited about.\"\n\nWynn noted that most on the left will likely never find a \"perfect candidate\" in a major presidential nominee.\n\n\"Unfortunately, American presidential elections are largely decided by Midwestern swing-state voters and not by socialists on Twitter,\" she said. \"So that's why you see candidates tending to say things that don't feel appealing to socialist Twitter.\"\n\nI'm a reporter covering internet and tech culture. I focus largely on how generative AI intersects with pop culture, as well as how social and political movements emerge online.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

      "text": "How the populist left has become vulnerable to the populist right\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nUPDATE (Jan. 12, 2023 12:00 p.m. E.T.): This piece has been updated to reflect Glenn Greenwald's response to a question about funding for his show on Rumble.\n\nSince the mid-2010s, the rise of the populist left and the populist right has shaken up the American political spectrum. Both movements have maneuvered to pressure and persuade the political establishment to adopt their objectives. But in recent years something unusual has been happening. We're seeing the formation of a pipeline that circumvents the center altogether - and directly connects left-wing to right-wing populism.\n\nA group of journalists and media personalities who once were at home on the far left has formed a niche but influential political subculture that encourages leftists to abandon leftism for the populist right. Its most recognizable faces are former icons of leftist discourse who have millions of diehard fans: Glenn Greenwald, a co-founder of The Intercept, known as one of the most powerful critics of the \"war on terror\" in the Bush era. Matt Taibbi, a former Rolling Stone writer, who was famous for excoriating defenders of neoliberalism and likening Goldman Sachs to a \"great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity.\" Tulsi Gabbard, formerly a Democratic House member and 2020 presidential candidate, was aligned with the Bernie Sanders wing of the party.\n\nBut in recent years their focus has changed. These commentators had never hesitated to criticize Democrats alongside Republicans. But now they've pivoted to targeting liberals nearly exclusively, while forming ties with the authoritarian right.\n\nAnti-lib populism might not necessarily convert leftists into MAGA activists. But it could still do damage by generating cynicism.\n\nOn issues such as free speech, the war in Ukraine, and social inclusivity, this group's commentary has garnered tremendous attention and plaudits from right-wingers, and some of them have grown fond of using conservative media platforms to spread their message. In 2022 this trend appeared to reach new heights. Gabbard served as a guest host for Fox News' white nationalist-in-chief, Tucker Carlson. Taibbi became right-wing Twitter CEO Elon Musk's go-to stenographer for a series of leaks from Twitter's internal documents meant to make Musk's takeover of the social media platform look necessary. Greenwald attended the premier of a documentary about right-wing disinformation mogul Alex Jones and conducted a shockingly sympathetic interview with him.\n\nCollectively, these and other lesser-known pundits push a political position that could be called \"anti-lib populism.\" (\"Lib\" as in the pejorative slang term for a liberal, in currency among leftists and the right.) Like all populisms, it purports to oppose elitism and speak on behalf of the people. But as a practice, it funnels people toward the snake-oil populism of the right.\n\nAnti-lib populism may not necessarily convert leftists into MAGA activists en masse. But it could still do damage by generating cynicism that could divide the left. That's why the left must be vigilant about its rise.\n\nOne of the most prominent strategies of anti-lib populists is casting liberal media as the biggest threat to free speech in America. Taibbi and Greenwald spend a lot of energy warning about cancel culture and opposing deplatforming and speech regulation on internet platforms OKed by a liberal worldview. Some of it is legitimate - I, too, worry about opaque internet censorship and certain aspects of cancel culture like self-sabotaging groupthink and targeting people's jobs for misbehavior. But what's odd about the anti-lib outlook is its singular focus on liberals.\n\nThe right is at least as worrisome on the issue of restricting speech, and in some respects far more. The GOP has become an overt advocate for government censorship on college campuses and in schools and libraries . When he was president, Trump ramped up legal attacks on the media and harassed journalists. The MAGA right endeavors to dampen the very meaning of free speech by embracing disinformation as a political strategy. Billionaires who are hostile to the left own social media platforms and make decisions about speech based on profit motives.\n\nYet somehow Taibbi has said he finds Republicans \" irrelevant \" on matters of speech, has downplayed Fox's enormous influence on the right, and has preposterously argued that all elites are on the left side of the spectrum . Greenwald focuses the lion's share of his criticisms of censorship as a phenomenon tied to Democrats and liberal media.\n\nTaibbi's blinkered attitude about speech likely explains why Musk, who has revealed himself to be a QAnon-friendly fan of MAGA politics , appears to have entrusted Taibbi with a cache of Twitter documents to report on Twitter's history of controlling speech on its platform. To be clear, the leaks have helped shine a light on some deeply troubling issues, like the FBI's apparent input into Twitter's speech regulation . But it's notable that Taibbi has exaggerated and misframed the import of his exposé , and that by agreeing to conditions set by Musk (or Musk-connected sources) regarding his access to the information and where he could publish it, he has tainted his findings with the aura of a comms operation. (Taibbi once noted in the past, \"Once you start getting handed things, then you've lost.\") He has also conveniently lost his sharp tongue when it comes to Musk's arbitrary suppression of users on Twitter .\n\nIf you are a free speech warrior, you should be concerned about threats to robust speech that manifest across the political spectrum, and you should take steps to demonstrate your independence from plutocrats who are whimsically buying public squares. Instead, anti-lib populists finds common cause with the right and designate Democrats as the implacable enemy.\n\nAnother example of how anti-lib populism tries to nudge the left to come to mistaken conclusions about the nature of the right is the war in Ukraine. Now, Gabbard and other anti-lib populists have correctly pointed out that the Democratic Party has been overly blasé about nuclear escalation with Russia, and has stigmatized even minor dissent over the issue of how the U.S. should approach vital diplomacy with Moscow. That concern overlaps with the leftist antiwar posture of groups like the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nBut the anti-lib populists focus almost all their energy on the Democrats, despite the fact that most Republican lawmakers share the Democrats' position. Gabbard cited Ukraine policy as the primary reason she left the Democratic Party and slams it as controlled by \"warmongers\"; Greenwald trumpets MAGA dissent on Ukraine aid as a sign of the GOP's politico-intellectual health.\n\nMore worryingly, they implicitly imply the MAGA right is antiwar when it's anything but. While it's true that the MAGA wing's increasing hesitation to involve itself in Ukraine has the effect of calling for a less hawkish position than many Democrats, the actual ideology underlying the position isn't fundamentally antiwar.\n\nTrump and MAGA Republicans are nationalists interested in militarizing domestic American life. They're in favor of aggressively securing the borders, supporting armed vigilante formations and emboldening militarized police. And while Trump isn't interested in the kind of nation-building that both parties supported during the war on terrorism, he exhibited no lack of appetite for war when he torpedoed the Iran nuclear deal, played chicken with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, requested colossal defense budgets , continued drone warfare but with less transparency, called for military parades in the streets and employed strategists such as Steve Bannon who enjoy saber-rattling about the prospect of war with China.\n\nThe reality is that Democrats and Republicans today are hawkish in different ways, and anybody who cares about making America less bellicose - both at home and abroad - should be angling to pressure both parties. But the anti-lib populists focus all their energy on disparaging the Democrats.\n\nThere are also other players who aren't as big as Gabbard, Greenwald or Taibbi are also involved in this game of pushing the left to consider right-wing populism across a number of different issues. YouTuber Jimmy Dore deemed the self-described leftist lawmakers in \"the squad\" frauds for declining to try to block Nancy Pelosi's speakership to \"force the vote\" on Medicare-for-all, a strategic question that split the left at the beginning of the Biden presidency. Regardless of one's position on that issue - I had mixed feelings - it's illuminating to contrast Dore's eagerness to dismiss the squad as sellouts with his charitable attitude to the right. Just a few months later he conducted a remarkably credulous interview with a Boogaloo Boi, a member of a violent accelerationist movement with roots in right-wing, anti-government and white nationalist belief systems.\n\nThe hosts of \"Red Scare,\" a popular podcast once considered part of \"the dirtbag left,\" also probably fits into the anti-lib populist scene. The cohosts of Red Scare issue critiques of capitalism and reserve plenty of venom for liberals. But they also pal around with the authoritarian right; they've conducted friendly interviews with Jones of Infowars and Curtis Yarvin, a neo-monarchist blogger.\n\nIt is not unusual for leftists activists and thinkers to focus a significant amount of energy on criticizing Democrats, since Democrats are, theoretically, more likely to be receptive to or susceptible to left-wing ideas, and are more realistic bargaining partners on a number of policy issues like expanding the welfare state. Meanwhile, the right is often seen as a lost cause. (Or sometimes the right is seen as indistinguishable from Democrats, depending on the issue.) But in anti-lib populism, liberal politics is portrayed as irreversibly corrupt, and the populist right is hinted at as an idyllic alternative.\n\nAnti-lib populists can do something doctrinaire right-wing populists can't - use their cred in leftist circles to issue critiques that act as a crowbar to crack open fissures on the left.\n\nA skeptic of my schematic might say that I'm simply describing right-wing populists. Well, not exactly. First of all, these commentators don't fit neatly into any conventional ideological box (and, complicating things further, never really did very neatly fit on the left). Greenwald's stated normative views are decidedly not conventionally right-wing; Gabbard identifies as an independent and has declined to join the Republicans (at least for now); Taibbi calls himself a \"run-of-the-mill, old-school ACLU liberal\" who likes Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\n\nMoreover, as discussed earlier, they still hold some views that overlap with a leftist sensibility, and it's reasonable to assume they still have many left-wing followers. And that's why their interventions matter. Anti-lib populists can do something doctrinaire right-wing populists can't - use their cred in leftist circles to issue critiques that act as a crowbar to crack open fissures on the left. And they can distort the nature of the right to make it appear innocuous. Witness Greenwald's (tortured) attempt to portray Tucker Carlson, Steve Bannon and 2015-era Donald Trump as socialists .\n\nI can't say I understand the origins of this phenomenon, or that there's a single explanation for it. Part of it could be a reactionary response to the the rise of \"woke politics,\" a preoccupation of almost all anti-lib populists. Part of it could be growing fed up with the Democratic establishment, particularly after it fended off the Sanders insurgency in two presidential primaries, and resolving to go to war against it. Part of it could be the economics of provocation and contrarianism - anti-lib populists are almost always in independent media, and might find it financially rewarding to relentlessly own the libs. Part of it could be based on their commonly articulated (and misguided) belief that media - and mostly liberal media - is the single greatest source of power in society. Part of it could be naivete about what the populist right really stands for. Whatever it is, the result is an orientation that's adept at generating cynicism.\n\nThe authoritarian right has delighted in the emergence of anti-lib populism. It knows that even if disillusioned leftists don't join the right, it's worth destroying their faith in the possibility of building a mass movement including Democrats. Yarvin, one of the most influential intellectuals of the \"new right,\" has said a key strategy for his movement is to \"sow acorns of dark doubt\" in the minds of the left and pounce when its \"conviction and energy flag.\" Put more simply: divide and conquer. This is why Yarvin and a number of influencers on the right mingle with anti-lib populists, help them with exposure and seek to work with them on media platforms.\n\nPolitical axes are being scrambled. Strange bedfellows roam the streets and the halls of power.\n\nGreenwald has recently launched a show with what he describes as a \"cable news budget\" on Rumble, an independent alternative to YouTube. Greenwald told me in a direct message over Twitter that Rumble is providing the funding and paying him for the show. Rumble is backed by Peter Thiel , a Silicon Valley tycoon who has funded ultranationalist political candidates for the Senate, such as the recently elected Republican J.D. Vance of Ohio, and has said he doesn't \"believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.\" Greenwald and Taibbi have hosted podcasts on Callin, a podcast platform backed by David Sacks , a right-wing venture capitalist and pal of Musk. Gabbard is a paid contributor to Fox News. Blake Masters, who ran a failed ultra-MAGA campaign for the Senate in Arizona in November, said he and Thiel have met with one of the hosts of \"Red Scare\" and would consider financially backing the podcast.\n\nNone of this is to suggest that anti-lib populists have been bought off or are taking direct editorial cues from owners of platforms. The point is authoritarian elements of the capitalist class are cultivating relationships with anti-lib populists and backing platforms that can facilitate the left-to-right-wing populism pipeline. Networks and infrastructure are being crafted.\n\nIt's too early to identify how this scene could be reshaping political identity and behavior. But it should be taken seriously. This scene has lots of followers and citizens take ideological cues from leaders.\n\nWe live in an era of ongoing ideological rupture. Political axes are being scrambled. Strange bedfellows roam the streets and the halls of power. For leftists, this is a time for discipline and clear-eyed appraisals of possibility and peril. If we are to have a civilized, democratic society, the populism pipeline must flow the other way.\n\nZeeshan Aleem is a writer and editor for MSNBC Daily.

      "text": "America's self-righteous contrarian trap\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nFollowing Fox News star Tucker Carlson's firing last month, most on the left were celebrating. Not the high-profile progressive politics and policy journal The American Prospect though. An article there mystifyingly praised Carlson as someone who \"punctured the lazy pieties of the media class.\" That's a funny way to describe someone whose vicious racism and misogyny are well-documented .\n\nSo why would a left-wing publication apologize for a lying right-wing bigot who uses his platform to terrorize critics on the left? The answer is anti-establishment branding. Carlson presents himself as a foe of \"elites\" and of those in power. But he's not the only one benefitting from this misplaced iconoclast romanticism.\n\nSome people on the left (and not just on the left) love anti-establishment branding.\n\nSome people on the left (and not just on the left) love anti-establishment branding whether it's deployed by Carlson, or by self-help author and current presidential candidate Marianne Williamson , or by her fellow Democratic candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. , a conspiracy theorist and anti-vaxxer. (We could even include billionaire blusterer Elon Musk on that list.)\n\nRailing against the squares or against the ruling class sounds cool and edgy. And people who are committed to change, or at least very frustrated with the status quo, like many on the left, can mistake cool and edgy for actual liberatory politics.\n\nThe dynamic is quite clear in the article on Carlson in the Prospect. \"Carlson's insistent distrust of his powerful guests acts as a solvent to authority, frequently making larger-than-life figures of the political establishment defend arguments they otherwise treat as self-evident,\" authors Lee Harris and Luke Goldstein gushed.\n\nThe thing is though that when Carlson attacks \"elites,\" he's not talking about those in power. For instance, one of Carlson's favorite targets is billionaire Democratic donor George Soros . Conspiracy theories about Soros are among the most common and dangerous antisemitic dog-whistles on the right. The shooter who murdered 11 people at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh was partly inspired by Soros conspiracy theories. You cannot separate Carlson's alleged populism from his nativism. (The Prospect itself, after much criticism, apologized and acknowledged that the article \"downplayed[ed] the motivations\" of right-wing populists.]\n\nYou can see a similar left confusion of marketing and politics in a recent Marianne Williamson puff piece at Jacobin, another important left outlet. In a breathless interview, Liza Featherstone chronicles every time the candidate denounces the \"neoliberal crowd\" or praises socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nWilliamson isn't a fascist reactionary like Carlson. But she's got no qualifications for president either; she's never run held political office. And while she's rebranded herself to look like a lefty candidate, historically she's voiced a lot of those neoliberal opinions she claims to be against, often blaming individuals for their own suffering.\n\nShe has insisted that people suffering from AIDS need to \" forgive everybody \" in their lives to recover, for example, a strange prescription that seems to imply people who died from AIDS may not have been sufficiently spiritually advanced. She has also said the term \"clinical depression\" is a \" scam \" and signaled support for the anti-vaccine movement.\n\nWilliamson has since walked back some of those positions. But her work overall presents a portrait of a woman who believes that illnesses are in some ways mental and spiritual lapses which can be banished through introspective New Age positive thinking.\n\nWhether or not you think those views qualify as anti-establishment, they're not progressive. Leftists should show solidarity with disabled people and advocate for accommodations and better public health measures, not suggest they read more self-help books. Yet Jacobin was so dazzled by Williamson's bromides it failed to even ask her about her controversial, and ugly, statements about vaccinations or depression.\n\nTo be fair, it's not just leftists who get bamboozled by anti-establishment branding. David Samuels, a thoroughly centrist journalist, published an absolutely groveling interview last week with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. at the thoroughly centrist Tablet.\n\nTo be fair, it's not just leftists who get bamboozled by anti-establishment branding.\n\n\"The fact that Robert F. Kennedy is the country's leading 'conspiracy theorist\" alone qualifies him to be president,\" Samuels proclaimed. Kennedy believes in nonsense, debunked anti-vaccine theories, and that makes him a hero? By this logic, the more ridiculous and danger ous one's opinions , the cooler and edgier they become.\n\nSadly, that's a formula that works on centrist pundits as well as left ones. Everyone wants to self-righteously fight the man.\n\nBut if everyone wants to fight the man, is performatively fighting the man really that contrarian? In fact, praising wealthy, powerful, popular poseurs like Tucker Carlson or Marianne Williamson or Kennedy, Jr. is easy. The actual day-to-day grind of helping pregnant people access abortions in a post-Roe era, or reporting on the assault on trans rights , or protesting against out-of-control police budgets is less glamorous and less punchy.\n\nBoosting anyone who says they don't like Joe Biden isn't a substitute for left politics. Actual change requires solidarity, long-term commitment and a willingness to center people who aren't millionaires with national platforms. If you find yourself praising Marianne Williamson or Robert F. Kennedy this election cycle, you aren't a leftist. You're a mark.\n\nCORRECTION (May 3, 2023, 11:50 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated Marianne Williamson's political record. She has run for office, but she has never held elected office.\n\nNoah Berlatsky is a freelance writer and critic in Chicago.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

After all, reality -- it was pro-Trump forces that engaged in insurrectionist violence -- made some right-wing elements right look like dangerous criminals, so it stood to reason that much of the GOP would embrace conspiracy theories about \"leftists\" being responsible for the riot.\n\nThat line of argument will likely maintain some appeal indefinitely in unhinged circles, but FBI Director Chris Wray helped discredit the idea quite thoroughly in sworn testimony this week.\n\nAnd that, in turn, forced some Republicans to consider an alternative: maybe GOP officials can't blame the left for attacking the Capitol, but they could try to blame the left for attacking the White House.\n\nIndeed, in apparent reference to social-justice protests held outside the White House last summer, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), reading prewritten remarks, insisted at a committee hearing this week that there was \"a three-day siege on the White House,\" starting in late May.\n\nThere was no such \"siege,\" but as MSNBC's Hayes Brown noted , one of Grassley's colleagues echoed the sentiment.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., upped the stakes Wednesday during a hearing with the head of the D.C. National Guard and officials from the departments of Defense, Justice and Homeland Security. Bouncing off one witness's answer, Hawley referred to \"the events of the spring, which we're all familiar with.\"\n\nThe Missouri Republican went on to refer to last summer's \"attack on the White House,\" as if it were an event we'd all remember.\n\nThe subtext from Grassley and Hawley was hardly subtle. \"Fine, there was a right-wing attack on the Capitol,\" they effectively argued, \"but there was also a left-wing attack on the White House, so the scales should be seen as even.\"\n\nThe problem, of course, is that there was no attack on the White House, at least not since the British set it on fire 207 years ago.\n\nAs a Washington Post analysis explained, \"Hawley's framing is ludicrous. The protesters weren't seeking to attack the White House, nor did they. In fact, the protesters in Lafayette Square just north of the White House were eventually the target of a violent effort to disperse them by law enforcement at the scene.\"\n\nHayes Brown's piece added that the senator's claim was \"a real bit of historical revisionism.\"\n\nIt's always odd when assorted politicians try to rewrite history from many years ago, confident that many Americans won't remember the details of events from decades gone by. But to try to rewrite history from last summer is bizarre.\n\nThat said, there's no real mystery about Hawley's motivations, given his own role in helping feed the fire that led to the Jan. 6 attack. But as the Post 's analysis concluded, \"If there had been an attack on the executive mansion as there was an attack on the legislature, Hawley might better wave away questions about his decision to oppose the counting of electoral votes. But that is not what happened.\"\n\nPostscript : Both Grassley and Hawley emphasized that Trump was taken to a secure bunker during last summer's protests, which is true. But at no point was the then-president in actual danger -- it's not as if protestors roamed the halls of the White House chanting about \"hanging\" anyone -- making this largely irrelevant.\n\nLet's also note for context that Trump brazenly lied about what happened , as then-Attorney General Bill Barr helped prove.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), one of Congress' most right-wing members, who suggested that the riot incited by the president was an example of \" leftist violence .\" Soon after, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) said on the House floor that he believes there were \"antifa\" members \"masquerading as Trump supporters\" committing acts of violence at the Capitol.\n\nThe idiocy spread quickly .\n\nLou Dobbs and Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., discussed the possibility of antifa instigators' infiltrating the pro-Trump mob. And former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin made the same claim, telling Fox News host Martha MacCallum that it was unclear who was instigating the riots. \"A lot of it is the antifa folks,\" Palin said, citing \"pictures\" she had seen. Laura Ingraham, one of the channel's primetime hosts, spent much of the hour of her show suggesting without evidence that the Trump protesters had been infiltrated by antifa.\n\nThere are plenty of additional examples . You can expect an email along these lines from your weird relatives who consume far-right media all day.\n\nThere are, of course, some glaring problems with this. First, it's stark raving mad.\n\nSecond, we can say with confidence that it's stark raving mad because many of the far-right rioters made little effort to hide the fact that they were far-right rioters. They took selfies. They tweeted their attack. Some quite literally livestreamed the riot in real time.\n\nTo see this as some kind of \"masquerade\" is to think antifa ne'er-do-wells had reconstructive plastic surgery to make themselves look like people we already know to be right-wing activists.\n\nBut even if we put all of that aside, what I find especially amazing is the cognitive dissonance. Donald Trump spent months lying to these right-wing rioters, before practically begging them to come to D.C. for a gathering designed to coincide with the certification of Joe Biden's victory. The president then rallied them, dispatched them to the Capitol, and directed them not to show any \"weakness.\"\n\nAfter he incited the violent attack on the Capitol, Trump praised the rioters , offered a justification for their crimes. In a missive that Twitter soon after removed, the president referred to his supporters as \"great patriots,\" before adding, \"Remember this day forever!\"\n\nThese were not the words of a man who was disappointed with an attack on his own country's Capitol; these were the words of a man who approved of what he saw and was sympathetic to those who acted at his behest.\n\nWhich makes the \"antifa\" talk that much more bewildering. The rioters are simultaneously patriots who did the right thing and secret leftists to be condemned? The mob is both a source of pride and an embarrassment?\n\nUpdate : Much of the right-wing chatter about this is based on an article in the conservative Washington Times . With this in mind, Buzzfeed reported today, \"A facial recognition company says a viral Washington Times story claiming it identified antifa members among the mob that stormed the Capitol on Wednesday is completely false.\"\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

      "text": "Trump's new obsession with William McKinley undermines his 'populist' reputation\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nDonald Trump 's inauguration speech was full of red meat for his supporters. There were vague but ominous references to a \"horrible betrayal\" of America in the recent past. He claimed that America's education system teaches young people to \"hate our country.\" He lumped together the assassination attempt he survived in July with his years of legal problems, portraying all of it as the work of \"[t]hose who wish to stop our cause.\" And he promised to \"send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country.\"\n\nThis is all pretty standard Trump stuff, infuriating to leftists like me but music to the ears of the MAGA faithful . About two-thirds of the way through the speech, though, he devoted two full paragraphs to talking about his admiration for the 25th President of the United States, William McKinley .\n\nTrump took time in his speech to effusively praise the greatest enemy of the original 'populists.'\n\nIt was a deeply revealing moment. Trump is constantly portrayed by both friends and enemies as a \"populist.\" Steve Bannon , for example, talks about Trumpism as a \"nationalist, populist revolution.\" Bannon thinks that's a good thing. On the other end of the Republican spectrum we have Marc Short, former chief of staff for former Vice President Mike Pence, expressing horror at the prospect that Trump's new administration will be marked by \"a populist ideology more akin to that of Bernie Sanders than Ronald Reagan.\" And yet Trump took time in his speech to effusively praise the greatest enemy of the original \"populists.\"\n\nAccording to Thomas Frank's excellent book \"The People, No: A Brief History of Anti-Populism,\" the word \"populism\" was first coined on a train ride from Kansas City to Topeka in 1891. The group on the train was looking for a \"catchy word\" to describe the adherents of the political party they'd just founded.\n\nDuring its brief moment in the sun, the People's Party was one of the most effective third parties in American history. At its core, they were a movement of poor farmers being ground down by big banks and monopolistic businesses, although they also worked to build bridges with urban workers and they attracted the support of labor union leaders like Eugene V. Debs (who would go on to become America's most prominent democratic socialist). According to Frank, the Kansans on that train in 1891 came up with the name \"in conversation with a local Democrat who knew some Latin.\" A \"populist\" was someone on the side of the \" populus \" (Latin for \"the people\") against wealthy plutocrats.\n\nThese original populists wanted to ease the financial burdens of small farmers by moving the United States off the gold standard, but they weren't a single-issue party. They advocated a whole raft of reforms ranging from a shorter workweek for the urban working class to public ownership of railroads to the direct election of senators. This was a broadly popular agenda. In the 1892 presidential election, the Populists nominated James Weaver, a brigadier general in the Union army in the Civil War, and he actually won four states (Colorado, Idaho, Kansas and North Dakota). It was the only time a third party had won even one state in decades, and it wouldn't happen again until Teddy Roosevelt's third-party \"Bull Moose\" run in 1912.\n\nIn 1896, the \"pops\" decided not to run a candidate of their own for two reasons. One is that the Democratic nominee, William Jennings Bryan, adopted important parts of the Populist platform. The other is that the Populists were terrified that, if they didn't line up behind Bryan, they'd split the vote and throw the election to a man they deeply hated and regarded as an ultra-reactionary champion of big business and the big bankers who were crushing them - Republican nominee William McKinley.\n\nMcKinley presided over years of plutocrat-friendly policies at home and warmongering abroad until he was assassinated by an anarchist factory worker in 1901.\n\nBryan ended up running with the nominations of both the Democrats and the Populists. Wealthy interests mobilized behind McKinley. Frank writes that pro-McKinley newspapers routinely fearmongered about the Bryan campaign with comparisons to the French Revolution. Political cartoonists \"loved to depict Populists as marching peasants wearing liberty caps\" and the New York Sun called Bryan \"William Jacobin Bryan.\"\n\nIn the end, McKinley won handily, and the People's Party collapsed. McKinley presided over years of plutocrat-friendly policies at home and warmongering abroad until he was assassinated by an anarchist factory worker in 1901.\n\nTrump loves McKinley, as he said in the inauguration speech, because McKinley \"made our country very rich through tariffs\" and Trump himself is enthusiastically pro-tariff. But this itself should give pause to anyone who thinks that tariffs are an innately \"populist\" tool of economic policy.\n\nThe original Populists hated tariffs, which at the time were seen as very much in the interests of business magnates and very much not in the interests of poor farmers like them. Their primary purpose is to protect the profit margins of American corporations from foreign competition, which sometimes helps the working class by making jobs more stable but doesn't do much to guarantee that they'll capture any significant chunk of their bosses' wealth - and meanwhile sticks them with higher prices at the grocery store.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's record from his first four years in office is like McKinley in that both were belligerently hostile to labor unions. McKinley sent federal troops to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho to crush striking mine workers. Trump filled the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) with hard-core union busters who made a series of decisions that made it harder for workers to organize unions, go on strike and win better contracts. And both were foreign-policy hawks. McKinley gave us the Spanish-American War. Trump tore up Obama's diplomatic détente with Iran and doubled the rate of drone strikes.\n\nSo he's not wrong to identify with President McKinley. But the sight of Trump heaping praise on the greatest anti-populist of the 19th century at an inauguration where he surrounded himself with a phalanx of tech billionaires reveals the deep absurdity of calling this man a \"populist.\"\n\nBen Burgis is a political commentator and author.

The university sheepishly acquiesced to virtually all of the administration's demands in an effort to restart talks to unfreeze that money.\n\nI recently wrote about the absurdity of the MAGA movement's lobbing claims of antisemitism precisely as some of the most prominent conservative influencers are praising Nazi apologists and even defending Adolf Hitler himself.\n\nThe Trump administration has given a range of rationales - from diversity-related policies to the recognition of trans people in collegiate athletic s - as it targets American universities, which JD Vance once branded \"the enemy . \" Beyond that, the White House has used allegations of antisemitism to pursue deportation of foreign students who have participated in pro-Palestinian protests .\n\nAmid all of this, I've been interested in hearing Jewish voices speaking about the administration's apparent use of Jewish people and their pain to carry out its illiberal goals - and the concerns they have about the White House's actions helping fuel antisemitism.\n\nJason Stanley, a philosophy professor who recently decided to leave Yale to go teach in Canada, recently explained on PBS' \"Amanpour & Company\" why he thinks the Trump administration's efforts are actually boosting antisemitic tropes:\n\nThis is reinforcing antisemitic tropes all across the political spectrum. ... What are the most toxic antisemitic tropes? Well, \"Jews control the institutions.\" This is absolutely reinforcing this. Any young American is going to think: Remember what happened when they took down the world's greatest university system on behalf of Jewish safety? And this will go down in history books - the history of this era will say that Jewish people were the sledgehammer for fascism. So if we don't speak out, if we American Jews do not speak out against this, this will be a grim chapter in our history as Americans. It's the first time in my life as an American that I have been fearful of our status as equal Americans - not because of the protests on campus, which, as I said, had a lot of Jewish students in them. But because we are suddenly at the center of U.S. politics. It's never good to be in the crosshairs for us. And we are being used to destroy democracy.\n\nDylan Williams, the vice president for government affairs at the Center for International Policy, a progressive think tank, agreed.\n\n\"This is exactly right and I have no doubt that it is how the overwhelming majority of Jewish Americans feel - we are being exploited in an attack on democracy, rights and the rule of law,\" Williams wrote on X .\n\nThis concern isn't confined to Jewish leftists. In fact, conservative writer Nick Cohen essentially warned about what we're seeing now back in December. In an article for The Jewish Chronicle headlined \"American Jews, beware of being used by Trump,\" he wrote:\n\nThere's an old saying that antisemitism is never really about Jews. Everyone from European fascists to today's Khomeinists, for example, uses anti-Jewish conspiracy theories to justify the denial of human rights to their own citizens. The same applies to the philosemitism of the Trump movement. It wants to use American Jews - most of whom still vote Democrat, I should add - as an excuse to undermine their political opponents in liberal universities and abolish the US Education department.\n\nFurthermore, Kenneth Stern, the director of Bard College's Center for the Study of Hate and a lead drafter of the working definition of antisemitism used by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, recently told NPR that the Trump administration's campus crackdown risks scapegoating Jewish students, as well.\n\n\"It puts pro-Israel Jewish students in a situation where they may be seen as trying to suppress speech rather than answer it,\" Stern said.\n\nAs NPR noted , the administration has adopted Stern's definition of antisemitism in its executive orders - but he says the definition is being distorted and weaponized.\n\nThese concerns, about purported allyship's being used in ways that ultimately may undermine Jews, mirror what some Asian Americans expressed as conservatives were using their communities to argue against - and do away with - race-conscious admissions on college campuses.\n\nNeedless to say, members of more than one marginalized group have shown wariness about the MAGA movement's claiming to act on their behalf. And they have ample reason to feel that way.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger. He previously wrote The ReidOut Blog.

That is what our government does best. Sometimes it feels like that is all it does.\n\nIt's how the U.S. government has described its actions against viruses, poverty, drugs and an assortment of other inanimate nouns. War is so overused it feels like the only metaphor around. But how else to describe the invasion of alien elements and their unwelcome occupation of local territory?\n\nWhen the Big Freeze came to Texas, the state's leaders duly girded themselves for battle. But they weren't the ones that rescued the Texans who found themselves besieged and waiting for rescue, huddled in collapsing houses as infrastructure failed. Instead, the people of Texas worked to save one another.\n\nThe stewards of Texas - its guardians by law - went on television to shadowbox a foe of their own invention. They went to war against the specter of green energy.\n\nIt was the only option. Their leaders were otherwise occupied, busy fighting not against the ice, or the snow, or the failure of the state's independent power grid; not against the undrinkable water, still affecting millions as of Monday ; or the burst pipes or the flooded houses or the hypothermia that killed dozens ; nor the carbon-monoxide poisonings or house fires started by desperate people listening to the howling in their blood to just get warm.\n\nNo, the stewards of Texas - its guardians by law - went on television to shadowbox a foe of their own invention. They went to war against the specter of green energy.\n\nFrom Gov. Greg Abbott - who went on Fox News and blamed renewable fuels for the catastrophe - down to the mayor of one Texas town who resigned after castigating his constituents for demanding water, power and warmth, the state failed to actually help its citizens.\n\nThey preferred to tilt at wind turbines that provided a fraction of the power that failed freezing families across the state. Even as new injuries and deaths were revealed by thawing roads, they waged their culture war against the foes of fossil fuels. Their principal enemy was a Democratic congresswoman from New York, the face of as-yet-hypothetical environmental legislation, who was busy raising $5 million in aid for their state.\n\nHospitals evacuated , waterless and frigid; those in the state's care shivered in reeking, frozen jails , but the supply of televised hot air was inexhaustible. The culture war could not be abandoned even for a day or an hour. Its dour warriors did not stray from their posts.\n\nThose who were left behind while the great men raged live in Texas' cities and towns, large and small. And the best of them recognized that the only way to win the war was not to wage war at all. Against an elemental force and a state that failed them, they recognized that the best way to survive was to band together, and practice mutual aid - supporting one another with what little they had.\n\nAgainst an elemental force and a state that failed them, they recognized that the best way to survive was to band together, and practice mutual aid - supporting one another with what little they had.\n\nFamilies, friends and neighbors piled into one each other's houses; those with heat shared it, as did those with water, making the difficult choice between weathering a storm and risking a plague. Mutual aid groups organized by leftists reached the rest of the country on the last percentages of their dying phones, seeking donations on Venmo and Cashapp for hotel rooms for those without light, for food and water as pipes ran dry and groceries spoiled.\n\nMutual Aid Houston, a self-described \"tiny group of 9 organizers,\" says they have distributed $197,000 in direct cash aid from thousands of donors. Volunteers traversed icy roads to fill community fridges with continual infusions of free groceries. Feed the People Dallas raised thousands of dollars to relocate all the members of a homeless encampment in Fort Worth to hotels during the storm, and delivered microwaves, soup and groceries, skidding along frozen roads. The Democratic Socialists of America Houston distributed pallets of water by the truckful. \"We're going to figure out how to keep each other alive,\" Anna Maria, one of the organizers for Mutual Aid Houston, told The Texas Tribune.\n\nIt's fitting, then, that the term \"mutual aid\" should have a frigid place as its origin. The Russian anarchist Pyotr Kropotkin drew his observations of the phenomenon in 1902 from his study of animals in Siberia who, facing scarcity of resources in the extreme cold, tended toward cooperation rather than competition for survival. Among humans, Kropotkin theorized, the law of mutual aid is folded into higher moral sentiments. \"It is the conscience - be it only at the stage of an instinct - of human solidarity,\" he wrote. \"It is the unconscious recognition of the force that is borrowed by each man from the practice of mutual aid; of the close dependency of every one's happiness upon the happiness of all.\"\n\nTexas may have warmed back up to its normal temperatures, but across the state, homes are still waterlogged , scant belongings beginning to molder. The flow of mutual aid hasn't stopped, though; it keeps pace with need. Like the anarchist organizers who jury-rigged solar power grids for villages in Puerto Rico when the island's electrical authority neglected them for nearly a year; like the community fridges across the country that have fed the unhoused and the needy since the pandemic's beginning, as we approach its anniversary in the United States; Texans are finding alternative sources of power in the bonds between one another, in the state's absence.\n\nTexas may be an extreme case, with its decadeslong policies of deregulation and isolationism enabling a rickety, unweatherized power grid. But throughout the country, the very notion of interdependence, of common good, has eroded over decades of austerity, false scarcity and the cruel, parsimonious bureaucracy of means testing.\n\nThe measures being considered on the federal level run contrary to the eagerness with which community members rush to help one another, offering open hands to the afflicted.\n\nNearly a year into the pandemic, a change in presidential administration has thus far largely meant a change in rhetoric from callousness and denial to a pageantry of candlelit mourning . The measures being considered on the federal level run contrary to the eagerness with which community members rush to help one another, offering open hands to the afflicted.\n\nThe process is slow and sclerotic, the direct aid impossibly inadequate, though the need is mounting, and despair mounts swiftly on despair. The nation's reserves of cash seem to remain open only to the machinery of war. A state carved out from within like a hollow-point bullet delivers little but pain, and what is given is too little, and too slow.

This so-called scourge is most evident, they argue, in the Justice Department and FBI's treatment of former President Donald Trump.\n\nHouse Republicans have come up short on evidence to support the idea that leftists get a pass under the current system or that there's rampant politicization that has infected the DOJ's processes. But a pro-Trump think tank nevertheless has a solution to this nonproblem: Make the Justice Department less independent , giving presidents more direct control of how criminal cases are conducted. It's an absurd conclusion to draw, one that would only open the door to actual targeting of Trump's political enemies down the line.\n\nThroughout his presidency, Trump found himself at odds with his attorneys general and the Justice Department more broadly, particularly during the depths of the Russia investigation and in the aftermath of the 2020 election. While Jeff Sessions and William Barr insisted on following post-Watergate norms surrounding prosecutorial independence, Trump saw the DOJ as a tool that should be wielded for his own personal, political benefit . Since leaving office, his attacks on the department have been adopted by a growing swath of the GOP, with calls to defund the FBI and otherwise rein in federal prosecutors run amok.\n\nEnter Jeffrey Clark. As an official in the Trump Justice Department, he was the sole voice at the DOJ willing to back Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. For his loyalty, Trump attempted to install Clark as attorney general, reversing course only after the rest of the department's top leadership threatened to resign in protest. Now Clark is ensconced as a senior fellow and director of litigation at the Center for Renewing America , alongside his fellow former Trump administration official turned far-right enabler Russ Vought .\n\nIn that role, Clark recently produced an analysis arguing that the Department of Justice should not, in fact, be treated as independent . Instead, Clark writes, the president should be able to exercise their will over it like any other Cabinet position, given that executive authority is vested solely in him. It goes further than the \"unitary executive theory\" that Barr and other conservatives have championed, claiming that any sort of check on the president's duty to ensure that laws are executed faithfully - that is, enforcing the law - is constitutionally invalid.\n\nThat flies in the face of the current firewall laid out in Justice Department and White House counsel memos, which allow presidents to set broad policies and standards for the department but keeps them removed from the workings of individual cases. But that separation, Clark argues, has no basis in current federal law, let alone the Constitution as he posits the founders viewed it at the time. He also claims that the current system is, \"in practical reality, an illusion\" that frustrates the ability to hold the DOJ accountable while \"the incentives of the Attorney General to try to please his boss and respond to presidential control remain and cannot be overridden.\" The example he gives is that the White House counsel gave the green light for the National Archives to turn over classified material that Trump returned in January 2022 to the FBI as part of the investigation that would lead to the former president's federal indictment earlier this month.\n\nSetting aside the convoluted accusations of impropriety he cites there, Clark's analysis fails even when taken at face value. He does make solid points about the flimsy nature of the divide between the Justice Department and the White House, which are based more on norms than actual law. Attempts to codify the DOJ's independence have either failed to become law, as with the Protecting Our Democracy Act in 2021, or later been allowed to expire, as in the case of the independent counsel in the late 1990s.\n\nClark fails to explain how eliminating the DOJ's independence would cure the weaponization that he and Vought claim is taking place.\n\nBut Clark either outright ignores the reasons why these norms have come about or discounts them as progressivism run rampant. It is of utmost importance that the state's monopoly on violence in the name of the common good be carried out as part of the fair and impartial administration of justice, not at the petty whims of those who exercise it. This belief has fueled the calls for police reform from the left and is even given lip service from Trump supporters on the right. The current system is far from perfect, but the professionalism and determination to safeguard the rule of law that serve as its basis are meant to prevent the use of the Justice Department as a score-settling mechanism that petty tyrants would seek to deploy.\n\nMore importantly, Clark fails to explain how eliminating the DOJ's independence would cure the weaponization that he and Vought claim is taking place. Under his framing, Biden has the full authority to direct Attorney General Merrick Garland to harass Republicans. If this is something that is, and should be baked into the system, it undercuts Republicans' outrage that such targeting is supposedly occurring. And if, as House Republicans claim, the Justice Department and particularly the FBI - which has been headed by Republicans for the last several decades - has become a weapon against conservatives, I fail to see how allowing for greater political interference under a Democratic president would change that.\n\nTrump has already been crystal clear in his desire to retaliate against his enemies if he returns to the White House. Clark and others like him seek to enable this abuse of presidential authority by arguing that it's his prerogative to determine who should be investigated and direct his attorney general to follow his whims to a degree that even Richard Nixon failed to achieve. Their goal is not to disarm the DOJ as a weapon - it's to make it one that can be openly carried.\n\nHayes Brown is a writer and editor for MSNBC Daily, where he helps frame the news of the day for readers.

Ron DeSantis took credit for dumping a group of migrants and their families on Martha's Vineyard. On Friday, the victims of the Floridian's stunt were taken to a military base for shelter and humanitarian support.\n\nEvidently, Sen. Ted Cruz finds the political circumstances amusing. The Texas Republican published a tweet late last week that read:\n\n\"Leftists, hurriedly deleting their tweets saying the Martha's Vineyard liberals 'warmly welcomed' 50 illegal immigrants: 'Oh crap! They deported them IN 24 HOURS.'\"\n\nBefore we get to the forest, let's quickly review some of the trees - because Cruz managed to get literally every detail wrong.\n\nFirst, \"leftists\" haven't had to delete anything. Second, a great many residents of Martha's Vineyard really did step up to welcome the desperate people Team DeSantis allegedly lied to and exploited. Third, to characterize asylum seekers as \"illegal\" border crossers is just factually wrong. Fourth, these migrants and their families weren't \"deported,\" at least not by any definition that Americans would recognize. And fifth, two days is not 24 hours.\n\nIt's not easy to squeeze five falsehoods into a two-sentence tweet, but the Texas Republican is a special kind of politician.\n\nAs notable as the details are, however, it's the larger context that's more interesting.\n\nThe day that DeSantis' chartered planes landed on the Massachusetts island, his political operation hinted at one of the motivations behind the stunt: They were going to prove that liberal rhetoric about welcoming migrants was wrong. The proof would come when Martha's Vineyard residents lashed out at the struggling people the Floridian had dumped in their community.\n\nThose assumptions were quickly discredited when locals rallied to assist the human beings DeSantis exploited as political props.\n\nBut in a curious twist, Cruz and other Republicans are still clinging to the discredited initial claim. \"See?\" they're effectively arguing. \"Look how quickly those rascally libs deported the migrants!\"\n\nReality keeps getting in the way. The migrants and their families were taken to a base on Cape Cod to be cared for because there were no comparable facilities on Martha's Vineyard. As the NBC affiliate in Boston reported , \"Shortly after the arrival of the migrants, Martha's Vineyard residents joined with local and state officials to create temporary shelter and provide food and other necessities. But [Gov. Charlie] Baker's administration said the island is not equipped to provide ongoing food and shelter, so transportation was provided on Friday to bring the migrants to the new temporary shelter on Cape Cod.\"\n\nTo hear Cruz tell it, this proves that conservatives were right all along. This turns reality on its head. Residents of Martha's Vineyard treated these migrants and their families with dignity and compassion, and they're now poised to receive additional assistance from the state.\n\nTo the extent that DeSantis' cruel stunt had a political goal, it failed spectacularly. To pretend otherwise is to ignore what actually happened.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Senator John Fetterman denounces progressives who condemn the war in Gaza and oppose strict limits on undocumented migration. Anger at President Biden's support for Israel spawns hashtags like #GenocideJoe and pledges to vote for Jill Stein, Cornel West-or refusals to cast a ballot at all. The broad center-left coalition that united to resist Trump as soon as he moved into the White House-and then humbled the GOP at the polls in 2018 and 2020-is coming apart. Knitting it back together before November will be difficult-but vital.\n\nNeither side seems to have learned a basic truth from the history of American politics: Democrats and leftists, liberal politicians and radical insurgents have always depended on each other to accomplish essential, if not sufficient, ends. Movements stoke the fires of mass discontent-but only the state can pass laws and overhaul key institutions. That relationship has often been rife with mistrust and contention: Dreamers of a new moral world unavoidably clash with pols who focus on winning the next election.\n\nBut they have often been able to work together for common purposes and to oppose a common enemy. In 2024, failure to find such a modus vivendi would allow a vicious authoritarian and his reactionary party to control the entire federal government again. Victory for Trump and his partisan faithful would set back the chance to build a kinder, more egalitarian, and peaceful society for years to come. Given Republican disdain for renewable sources of energy, it would also push the planet closer to environmental disaster.\n\nDemocrats and movement activists first began to cooperate over a century ago in efforts to resolve \"the labor question.\" In 1919, President Woodrow Wilson asked, \"How are the men and women who do the daily labor of the world to obtain progressive improvement in the conditions of their labor, to be made happier, and to be served better by the communities and the industries which their labor sustains and advances?\"\n\nWorking-class radicals had made that question impossible to ignore. During the Gilded Age, many were among the leaders of massive strikes against rapacious railroad firms and for an eight-hour day. Socialists were integral to forging the two national organizations of unions-the Knights of Labor and the American Federation of Labor-that emerged at the end of the 19th century. The first Democratic standard-bearer to embrace labor's cause was William Jennings Bryan, whom the AFL endorsed in his unsuccessful run for president in 1908.\n\nFour years later, unions helped get Wilson elected to the White House. There he signed some of the signature reforms of the era-from an income tax on the wealthiest Americans to an eight-hour day for railroad workers, to the creation of the Federal Trade Commission-the wellspring of anti-trust enforcement. Labor organizers willing to cooperate with Bryan, Wilson, and their fellow Democrats did have to stomach the party's fealty to the white supremacist order. The young African American radical A. Philip Randolph devoted himself instead to promoting the Socialist Party and organizing the first Black national union.\n\nWhen liberal Democrats returned to power in the 1930s, they forged a bond with leftists who pushed them, at last, to begin breaking with their racist heritage. The linchpin of this alliance was the Congress of Industrial Organizations, in which Communists and Socialists filled vital roles as organizers and leaders of such key affiliates as the Electrical Workers, the Auto Workers, and the West Coast longshoremen. Every union in the new federation welcomed African Americans as equal members; most also pressed Democrats to take a strong stand for civil rights. The battle against white supremacy, contended CIO spokesman John Brophy, was, at root, a class issue. \"Behind every lynching,\" he declared, \"is the figure of the labor exploiter, the man or the corporation who would deny labor its fundamental rights.\"\n\nIt was becoming increasingly difficult to be both an ardent New Dealer and a vocal defender of Jim Crow. By the end of the 1930s, half a million African Americans belonged to unions, an increase of more than 600 percent from a decade earlier.\n\nIn 1934, left organizers spearheaded a number of big walkouts for union recognition and higher pay. For several days, general strikes halted commerce in San Francisco and Minneapolis. A year later, the Democratic Congress responded by passing the National Labor Relations Act, drafted mainly by New York Senator Robert Wagner. Unions, it promised, would boost the economy as a whole: \"The inequality of bargaining power...tends to aggravate business\" downturns, \"by depressing wage rates and the purchasing power of wages earners in industry.\"\n\nAt a time when fascism was surging in Europe, Sidney Hillman, the socialist head of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, vowed, \"In the great alignment which will mean liberal forces on one side opposed to the forces of reaction, labor should take its place.\" Even during the recent heyday of neoliberalism, the alliance between Democrats and organized labor has endured.\n\nIn the early to mid-1960s, left-wing activists compelled Democratic officeholders to take a stand against racism and poverty and mobilized behind the new policies they enacted. That secret socialist Martin Luther King Jr. and such SNCC workers as John Lewis and Fannie Lou Hamer thrust the demand for Black liberation to the front of the liberal agenda. The Civil Rights and Voting Rights acts were the fruits of their struggle. In The Other America , Michael Harrington, an outspoken socialist, eloquently revealed the extent of poverty in the nation, motivating aides to John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson to create programs like food stamps and Medicaid that at least helped reduce it.\n\nLater that decade, radicals who were female or homosexual or disabled made headlines by asserting their precious, unfulfilled right to be respected as such both in law and the wider culture. In 1972, three years after the Stonewall riot helped birth a new liberation movement, the Democratic National Convention held serious debates about gay freedom as well as abolishing restrictions on abortion. The backing of feminists and the LGBT community would soon enable the party to present itself as a tolerant force that appealed to young, mostly secular voters in particular.\n\nBooks & the Arts / Brett Christophers\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nFeature / Jess McAllen\n\nJeet Heer\n\nThe rise of conservative movements and politicians from the 1970s on and the fragmentation between insurgent activists and liberal Democrats prevented any new alliance from forming. But a revival occurred early this century when protests against the Iraq War and the suffering of the Great Recession combined to create a fresh set of progressive movements-and to elect Barack Obama president.\n\nIn one sense, the left that thrived during the Obama years and kept growing after Trump's election in 2016 differed from its progenitors. Unlike labor's \"new millions\" in the 1930s, the Black freedom movement of the 1960s, or the anti-war movement later that decade, the newest American left rallied around no single issue that united its parts and stimulated its growth. Proponents of Occupy, Black Lives Matter, the Green New Deal, and a new union militancy applauded one another's demands while organizing separately. Notwithstanding their diverse passions, nearly all activists agreed that decades of conservative thinking and policies, under presidents and congresses of both parties, had turned the United States into a meaner nation in which the rich invariably got their way. Equality-in all its meanings-was their common desire.\n\nLeading Democrats warmed to these movements rhetorically, while they hedged on passing the kind of sweeping programs that activists demanded. During the fall of 2011, Nancy Pelosi, the former and future speaker of the House, said of Occupy Wall Street, \"I support the message to the establishment, whether it's Wall Street or the political establishment and the rest.\"\n\nTwo months later, Barack Obama called economic inequality \"the defining issue of our time.... Because what's at stake is whether this will be a country where working people can earn enough to raise a family, build a modest savings, own a home, secure their retirement.\" But the president made no serious attempt to get Congress to enact the Employee Free Choice Act, labor's main legislative priority. At Pelosi's insistence, he did make it a priority to pass the Affordable Care Act-a down payment of sorts on the universal coverage leftists had long advocated.\n\nTo have an African American as president also gave the new Black Lives Matter movement both a sense of hope and a target on which to train its frustrations with the slow pace of change. Some lashed out at Obama and other members of the Black elite, in and out of government, for preaching to young African Americans in poor communities a gospel of \"respectable\" speech and dress instead of enacting policies that would give them a good education and secure jobs at living wages.\n\nAt the same time, the enthusiasm for Obama's presidency, which never flagged among most African Americans, did help gain the Black left a nationwide audience for the first time in decades. Organizers of mass protests could point to the gap between Obama's rhetoric about racism and his lack of progress in combating the suffering it caused. As the journalist Jelani Cobb observed , \"Until there was a Black Presidency it was impossible to conceive of the limitations of one.\"\n\nDuring Obama's time in office, the most successful movement on the broad left was one with no explicit connection to class or racial equality. The LGBTQ activists who pressed for legalizing same-sex marriage managed to turn an extension of the sexual freedom espoused by cultural rebels in the 1960s into a demand for equal protection under the law. Four years after running for the presidency as an opponent of gay marriage, Obama changed his mind or, more likely, decided to help increase the speed at which the winds of politics were already blowing. In June 2015, by a single vote, the Supreme Court, in Obergefell v. Hodges , agreed, and marriage equality became the law of the land.\n\nAlthough Obama's gradual \"evolution\" on same-sex marriage frustrated its supporters, his change of position accelerated the pace of their victory. The president's new stance immediately became that of his party. It helped win over Black churchgoers as well as bind most young people of all races to the Democrats-when they could be bothered to vote.\n\nClear evidence that a mostly young left was thriving inside as well as outside the party emerged during the final year of Obama's tenure-in the extraordinary presidential run by an independent senator in his 70s who had often criticized the incumbent for not following through on his progressive promises. When Bernie Sanders announced his candidacy in 2015, he had already spent more than half a century advocating for an agenda that would turn the United States into a social-democratic nation-Finland with a lot more people and much warmer summers. By deciding to run as a Democrat, he infused the party with more progressive energy than at any time since the heyday of the Black freedom movement and the Great Society.\n\nOne result of Sanders's campaign was that the party's platform in 2016 leaned further leftward than any since the days when party leaders were proud to wear the liberal label. \"More than anyone else,\" commented the veteran progressive journalist Harold Meyerson, \"Bernie created the current American left, but just as much, by running for president, he revealed its existence-surprising the nation, surprising the left, surprising himself.\"\n\nJoe Biden is hardly the best figure to bridge the current divide between establishment Democrats and a left that veers between disgruntlement and rage. I wish he had decided, after the midterms that went surprisingly well for his party, to bow out of the race and leave younger, more inspiring politicians to compete to take his place.\n\nBut aside from his policy toward the war in Gaza, he has accomplished more that leftists should cheer-and with exceedingly narrow majorities in both houses of Congress-than any Democrat since LBJ (who enjoyed a much larger majority in Congress). Under Biden, planned investments in clean energy go far beyond any previous legislation; the government has the power to negotiate the prices of ten popular drugs with Big Pharma and has capped the cost of insulin; and the administration is doing what it can to protect the right to abortion. No president before Biden gave such open support to strikes and labor organizing. And only the damn filibuster prevented the Senate from enacting the PRO Act, which would give workers who want a union strong legal weapons to prevent employers from denying them that freedom.\n\nAlthough Democrats have been steadily losing the support of working-class voters, particularly white ones, their commitment to using the government to curb corporate power as well as empower employees has actually grown. A new scholarly article by Jacob Hacker and three other political scientists convincingly argues that both in its language and policies, \"the party's use of enhanced government spending and regulation to achieve society-wide economic goals continues to get pride of place.\" Every workday, the pro-union majority on the National Labor Relations Board and Lina Khan, the most aggressive chair of the Federal Trade Commission in memory, provide evidence of that.\n\nOf course, progressives should continue to protest Biden's failure to restrain Israel's deadly assault on the people of Gaza. But there is no reason they cannot, at the same time, make plans to do what they can to elect him and other Democrats in the fall. If in 1936, leftists could rally to the reelection campaign of Franklin D. Roosevelt, who also enjoyed enthusiastic support from the solid white South, their ideological successors ought to be able to campaign for a liberal president whose military aid to a longtime American ally they abhor.\n\nTime and again, Americans in a hurry to reach the promised land have thrown up fresh ideas, challenged entrenched elites, engaged in grassroots agitation, and pushed liberals down paths they may otherwise have shunned or tiptoed along at a craven pace. While the passion of their creed sometimes blinded leftists to the exigencies of the moment, they cannot be separated from the history of American reform.\n\nBut a relentless drumbeat of cynicism and hostility directed at the Democratic Party will surely set back the momentum for progressive change. In 1976, amid another presidential campaign, the veteran organizer Bayard Rustin wrote :\n\nGenuine radicalism...is not measured by how loud and abusively one can shout or by the purity and beauty of one's rhetoric. Rather, genuine radicalism seeks fundamental change through concerted, intelligent and long-range commitment.... Wherever we look we can find fault. But the only result of endless fault-finding is that you end up in a corner with the few people who are as good and pure as you are.... Those self-appointed spokesmen who raise divisive issues to prove the superiority of their politics are not really radical. By confusing and distracting from the real sources of social change, they retard the struggle for equality and justice.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Activate your online access\n\nIt's easier to blame activists, but far more powerful forces have led Democrats to neglect the real crises facing Americans.\n\nKamala Harris pauses while speaking on stage as she concedes the election, at Howard University on November 6, 2024, in Washington, DC.\n\nIn the aftermath of Kamala Harris's loss, many pundits and politicians are turning to a familiar scapegoat. Critics like Adam Jentleson, a former aide to senators Harry Reid and John Fetterman, claim that \"woke\" advocacy groups made Democrats adopt extreme policies and drove voters away from the Democratic Party, sealing Donald Trump's victory. But the truth is simpler-and more uncomfortable for the Democratic establishment. Despite the noise, voters didn't reject Harris because of leftist rhetoric or activist slogans. They rejected her because she and her party failed to address the economic pain of working-class voters, who chose change over more of the same.\n\nThere's a generation of Black and brown organizers, often the first in their families to step into positions of power, navigating institutions historically dominated by others. Alongside them are downwardly mobile white millennials, raised with expectations of stability but battered by an economy that delivers none. These activists, working within nonprofits and campaigns, fighting for causes once central to Democratic values, have somehow become scapegoats for the party's electoral woes.\n\nWhy, after every electoral loss, is the left always the scapegoat? It's easier to blame activists for pushing a progressive agenda than confront the real issue: the Democratic Party has long been shaped by far more powerful forces-corporate interests, lobbyists, and consultants-whose influence has neglected the real crises facing everyday Americans. We see this cycle again and again.\n\nContrary to establishment narratives, the Democratic leadership has often resisted advocacy organizations pushing for bold reforms on immigration, Big Tech, climate, debt, healthcare, rent, mass incarceration, Palestinian rights, and for policies like the Build Back Better agenda. This tension isn't just about differing priorities-it reveals the actual balance of forces in the party. Corporate donors on Wall Street and Silicon Valley pour billions into campaigns, shaping agendas to suit their interests. A consultant class reaps millions from flawed strategies and failed candidates yet continues to fail upward, perpetuating a pattern of mediocrity. They, not progressives, are the roadblock preventing Democrats from becoming a populist force that could disrupt the status quo and win back voters of all stripes.\n\nIt was these elements within the party that kneecapped the Democrats' most ambitious efforts to help ordinary Americans. The Biden administration entered with huge plans, notably Build Back Better, which would have delivered immediate relief: expanded child tax credits, free community college, universal child care and pre-K, paid leave, and more. Progressives pushed mightily for Build Back Better to pass. It was centrist obstruction-namely Senators Manchin and Sinema-that blocked those policies. The result was a patchwork of long-term measures like the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, whose benefits won't be felt until 2025 at the earliest, if at all. By failing to pass Build Back Better, Democrats lost the chance to deliver easy-to-understand, tangible economic benefits and solidify their image as the party of working people.\n\nAnd it was corporate Democrats-particularly lobbyists like Harris's brother-in-law, former Uber executive Tony West , and David Plouffe-who held the most sway over Harris's campaign. They advised her to cozy up to ultra-wealthy celebrities, Liz and Dick Cheney, and Mark Cuban, and avoid populist rhetoric that could have distanced her from the corporate elites who dominate the party. In 2024, the biggest spenders in Democratic Party politics weren't progressives-it was AIPAC, cryptocurrency PACs, and corporate giants like Uber, all of whom poured millions into Democratic campaigns without regard for public opinion or the will of the people.\n\nThe Harris campaign's messaging failed because, while populist economic appeals resonated with voters, the public face of the campaign was discouraged from embracing them. Instead, the focus was on issues like democracy and abortion, which, while important, couldn't by themselves capture the priorities of working-class voters. In her public remarks and interviews, Harris, drawing on the advice of corporate leaders, frequently adopted a Wall Street-friendly tone that resonated with business interests, even if it alienated many of her core supporters.\n\nIt's easy to forget that in 2020, Democrats saw historic turnout, driven largely by young voters who were energized by the largest left-wing and Black freedom protests since the 1960s. Biden won, and Democrats seemed to capture the nation's hunger for justice and change, even as protesters marched with polarizing slogans like \"Defund the Police.\" Despite the controversy surrounding these messages, Biden triumphed decisively, calling for racial justice. The energy in the streets reflected a moment of possibility, a vision that real change was within reach. But by 2024, that grassroots energy had dissipated, and the Biden-Harris administration did little to revive it.\n\nThe loss of energy that Biden and Harris presided over showed up in youth turnout, which dropped to 42 percent in 2024, down from 50 percent in 2020 and closer to 2016 levels. However, battleground states saw higher youth turnout, around 50 percent. Young voters favored Harris over Trump by four points (51 percent to 47 percent), a sharp decline from Biden's 25-point lead in 2020. The administration's failure to offer a compelling narrative or deliver meaningful economic reforms alienated many young voters, especially on issues like unconditional weapons transfers to Israel . Trump capitalized on this vacuum with false promises and an anti-war message. Meanwhile, young workers, hit hardest by inflation and stagnant wages, saw little relief from the administration's policies, leaving them feeling unseen and unmotivated. The simplest explanation may be the most accurate: after four years in opposition, Democrats under Biden had no plan for countering centrist obstruction from Manchin and Sinema. Nor did they have a clear strategy for transitioning to a new candidate, as Biden once suggested, or supporting a contested 2024 primary.\n\nThis disconnect was made worse by the administration's lackluster communication strategy. Biden has avoided the media more than any modern president. In contrast, Mexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) dominated the narrative with daily, three-hour, entertaining, and combative press conferences that have earned him one of the largest YouTube followings in Mexico. AMLO's approach to the attention economy helped his party to secure another presidential term , defying global anti-incumbent trends.\n\nBiden and Harris's reluctance to embrace what some Democratic elites might view as \"tasteless\" or \"uncouth\" populist appeals allowed their opponents to seize the public's attention, creating a void that ultimately drained the administration of the energy and momentum it once had. Trump's simple, emotionally charged narrative about fixing the economy, winding down foreign wars, restoring order, and protecting \"traditional\" American values may have been filled with bigotry and lies. But it commanded the public discourse, pushing the Biden-Harris administration off center stage.\n\nIt's true that some younger leftists embrace purity politics. But as Semafor 's Benjy Sarlin points out , the most polarizing moments in recent Democratic campaigns-like Beto O'Rourke's \"Hell yes\" remark on gun confiscation or Julián Castro's call to decriminalize border crossings during the 2020 primaries-were driven by the candidates themselves, not external activist pressure. Why did Kamala Harris take the positions she did in 2019? Because she was trying to distinguish herself in a crowded Democratic primary, where Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren were surging and Biden seemed to have the center locked down. Ultimately, these moves were about gaining media attention in a competitive primary, not a direct result of pressure from advocacy groups-many of which, like Sunrise Movement, Working Families Party, and Justice Democrats, with which I was affiliated, have spent years working within the system to create lasting change and deliver real policy results that resonate with voters\n\nThe backlash against \"wokeness\" often rests on vague critiques, offering little more than cultural hand-wringing without any clear solutions. And when those solutions do emerge, they're often morally indefensible. Jentleson's criticism of progressive advocacy groups rings especially hollow when you consider the track record of his own political mentors. In 2010, his former boss, Harry Reid, publicly opposed the \"Ground Zero mosque,\" a proposed Islamic cultural center near the World Trade Center. While technically acknowledging the developers' rights, Reid capitulated to Republican culture wars by suggesting Muslim Americans build the mosque elsewhere. This wasn't a principled stance-it was a political maneuver that lent legitimacy to Islamophobia, feeding into narratives from figures like Sarah Palin and Newt Gingrich, who compared the center to a Nazi building next to the Holocaust Museum. In doing so, Reid allowed bigotry to flourish, leaving a vulnerable community to bear the brunt of political scapegoating.\n\nFrom asylum seekers to transgender rights, today's debates mirror the \"Ground Zero mosque\" controversy. From 2017 to 2020, Democrats, including Harris, were eager to condemn Trump's cruel immigration policies. Now, however, they seem more focused on dodging the topic altogether. These are issues demanding a new approach, one that emphasizes year-round persuasion and agenda-setting over political convenience. Thermostatic public opinion might be a reality of politics, but voters appreciate when you stand for something with conviction and authenticity.\n\nThis is where movements and parties work best together: movements push the boundaries of what's possible, creating the political space to reframe issues like transgender rights and immigration in majoritarian terms, and politicians follow when the political weather aligns with their self-interest. These two sides will clash, but it's in that tension that progress lies.\n\nDemocrats can't be scared of that process. They must stop ceding the narrative to far-right framing and instead invest in populist campaigns that aren't afraid to antagonize villains, highlight the humanity of marginalized communities, and expose the Republican Party's divide-and-conquer tactics. Only then can they build the political power necessary to shift the conversation and secure real change.\n\nAnyone who knows me knows I'm critical of the academic jargon and misguided tactics that sometimes dominate activist circles. But to blame activists for the party's struggles is to overlook the much larger battles they're engaged in: 11 million undocumented Americans left in limbo, a prison system that incarcerates more people than any other in history, and an economy where three people hold more wealth than the bottom half of the country. These are the moral tests of our time-tests that any party claiming to stand for justice will be judged by. Scapegoating those pushing for change isn't just unfair; it's counterproductive, fracturing necessary coalitions and undermining the ability of the party to tackle the crises ahead.\n\nHarris's defeat should prompt serious introspection for Democrats-but not the narrow, one-sided critique Jentleson offers. Everyone, including progressive advocacy groups, has lessons to learn. The path forward isn't about hippie-punching-it never has been. Time and again, the center-left's response to electoral defeat has been to blame the unpopular and disruptive activists pushing for progress, whether abolitionists, suffragettes, labor unions, civil rights leaders, or environmentalists.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nBooks & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins\n\nJeet Heer\n\nHistory reveals that oversimplified approaches often sidestep the harder questions. Success doesn't come from rejecting the complexity of a diverse coalition but from learning to navigate it. To win, Democrats must inspire the public in a fractured information age, engage meaningfully with the cultural shifts around race, gender, family, and migration, make democracy work despite obstructionists like Manchin and Sinema, and-most critically-deliver tangible results that improve people's lives. And if the corporate, status quo-loving forces within the party are standing in the way of that mission, they must be moved aside.\n\nSuccess will come not by pointing fingers but by telling a story of transformation-with clear villains, bold vision, and conviction that democracy can, indeed, make a difference.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025. But we can't do this without you. As a reader-supported publication, we rely on the support of generous donors.

When Nikita Khrushchev sent tanks into Hungary to crush a grassroots uprising in 1956, many radicals chose that moment to stop apologizing for the Soviet Union. Ronald Radosh, a red-diaper baby who published seventeen articles in The Nation between 1966 and 1980, decided it was time to join the Communist Party USA. Later, when sane people were celebrating the end of the Vietnam War, Radosh and those around him regarded the moment as \"an occasion for deep melancholy.\" They liked the Vietnam War, he explained in his memoir, Commies ; it gave their lives meaning. Now that our country was no longer laying waste to Third World peasants, America, for these folks, \"could no longer so easily be called Amerika .\" And now that the exigencies of war could no longer excuse the communists' human-rights abuses, their struggle could no longer be idealized as the heroic effort to create a model Marxist society: \"The idea of an immediate, no-fault revolution, a fantasy of the previous decade, was no longer tenable.\" With that, Radosh doubled down again and traveled to Cuba with a group of revolutionary enthusiasts. One day, they visited a mental hospital.  A doctor there boasted, \"In our institution, we have a larger proportion of hospital inmates who have been lobotomized than any other mental hospital in the world.\" Back on their bus, a flabbergasted therapist exclaimed, \"Lobotomy is a horror. We must do something to stop this.\" Another member of the American  delegation shot back: \"We have to understand that there are differences between capitalist lobotomies and socialist lobotomies.\" Radosh, of course, ended up on the political right. The final straw came when he published a book in 1983 arguing that Julius Rosenberg was indeed guilty of the crime for which he had been executed in 1953. Radosh found himself unfairly attacked from the left. Thus was he moved to \"consider the ultimate heresy: perhaps the Left was wrong not just about the Rosenberg case, but about most everything else....

He doesn't note that two of his intellectual adversaries, Walter and Miriam Schneir, ultimately changed their minds about the case in the face of new evidence. Radosh's political journey follows a familiar pattern, well documented among Nation writers who end their careers on the right: a rigid extremist, possessed of the most over-the-top revolutionary fantasies, comes face to face with the complexity of the real world, then \"changes sides\" and makes his career by hysterically identifying the \"socialist lobotomies\" set as the only kind of leftist there is-ignoring evidence to the contrary that's right in front of his nose. * * * One of the first leftists to abandon the tribe in the pages of The Nation was no less than the magazine's longtime owner and columnist, Oswald Garrison Villard (1872-1949). Villard was such a doctrinaire pacifist that he resigned his column in protest in June 1940 because The Nation favored the United States' rearming to fight Hitler. As he wrote in his valedictory, the magazine had abandoned \"the chief glory of its great and honorable past\": its \"steadfast opposition to all preparations for war.\" He predicted that the course the editors were proposing would \"inevitably end all social and political progress, lower still further the standard of living, enslave labor, and, if persisted in, impose a dictatorship and turn us into a totalitarian state.\" Villard ended up starring in a 1975 book, Prophets on the Right: Profiles of Conservative Critics of American Globalism , whose author happened to be Ronald Radosh. The novelist and critic Granville Hicks (1901-1982) was an orthodox communist who in 1933 published a Marxist history of American literature. In 1940, however, Hicks published an essay in The Nation titled \"The Blind Alley of Marxism,\" in which he excoriated his comrades' unexamined political assumptions. Why, for instance, should \"the elimination of the economic contradictions of capitalism inevitably and automatically [lead] to the higher stage of social development?\" And why, he asked-not long after the Moscow trials railroaded many of the founders of the Soviet state into gulags-do American radicals give \"carte blanche...to a little group of men, five thousand miles away?\" This was thoughtful stuff, but rather than sticking around to nurture a rich debate, Hicks became an eager namer of names to the House Un-American Activities Committee. The culture and history of the left, of course, is shot through with silly, ideologically driven absurdities (\"socialist lobotomies,\" to coin a phrase). There is, for example, the argument Radosh made in The Nation in 1966 that Henry Wallace, perhaps the furthest-left major public official in the history of the United States, was actually a capitalist sellout. Another part of the pattern: the tendency to depict ostensibly revolutionary societies as lands straight out of a fairy tale. Max Eastman (1883-1969), who ended up in the orbit of National Review , filed a dispatch for The Nation in 1923 on a rail journey through Russia whose childlike wonder rivaled a scene from Tom Hanks's The Polar Express . The passport functionary \"was almost magically friendly and gentle.\" The cars were \"wider than railroad cars in America.\" The cabin had \"clean white bed-linen at a mild price, and a friendly young host in a workingman's shirt who came in every once in a while to know if we wouldn't like some tea.\" Some radicals have no problem maturing away from fantasies absorbed at the height of their revolutionary fervor while maintaining the moral core of their commitment to the broader left. Eastman, Radosh and, most famously, Whittaker Chambers (1901-1961), who contributed occasional poems to The Nation in the 1920s, instead went \"all the way.\" Afterward, they projected their own extremism onto the entire left and thus became conservative heroes. This is because they performed a matchless service in letting conservatives ignore the evidence of their senses: that the actual left is thoughtful, humane and diverse. Even if you're a confessed traitor like Chambers, your sins-provided you undergo the proper purification rites-are not an impediment to an embrace from the right, but an advertisement. By bearing witness to the myth that the right's adversaries are more wicked than other conservatives could possibly imagine, you ritualistically renourish the moral Manichaeism without which no right wing worthy of the name can survive. David Horowitz, for example, was an occasional contributor whose first Nation article was a 1964 essay about suicide in Scandinavia. In it, he argued it was no surprise that Swedes and Danes would want to kill themselves-because those countries were still, after all, capitalist nations. He now edits FrontPageMag.com, for which his friend Ronald Radosh publishes articles like \"The American Left: Friends of Our Country's Enemies.\" In 1979, on the cusp of his own apostasy, Horowitz wrote an essay wondering whether the left could ever shed its \"arrogant cloak of self-righteousness that elevates it above its own history and makes it impervious to the lessons of experience.\" That essay, however, was published in The Nation -vitiating his very claim about the arrogant self-righteousness of the left. J. Edgar Hoover once called communism \"a disease that spreads like an epidemic, and like an epidemic, quarantine is necessary to keep it from infecting the nation.\" The apostate from the left adds another crucial detail to that etiology: the idea that the infection is all the more frightening and dangerous because it's invisible, hiding within its host until it finds the opportune moment to do the most damage. Liberalism, like the devil, hides its true face. Thus the slogan of Horowitz's FrontPageMag.com: \"Inside Every Liberal Is a Totalitarian Screaming to Get Out.\" That's how conservatives can depict centrists like Barack Obama and Bill Clinton as aspiring commissars. Didn't Clinton, after all, hire the \"black Marxist Johnnetta [ sic ] Cole,\" as Radosh describes the former president of Spelman College, to direct his transition team for education? Back in the days of Radosh's trip to Cuba, Cole too had been a supporter of Fidel Castro. And so, wrote his friend Eric Breindel in the New York Post , the conclusion was \"inescapable\" that Clinton was not \"interested in distinguishing between a left-liberal and someone who cast her lot with the cause of Communist totalitarianism.\" * * * Of course, plenty of Nation writers traveled rightward with their honor intact. The sociologist Alan Wolfe, once a gentlemanly radical, is now a gentlemanly centrist. He helps to make my point: his contributions to these pages in the 1970s and '80s were resolutely unsilly; he doesn't have to despise leftists now because he never gave himself a reason to despise the leftist he was then. Max Lerner (1902-1992), a towering legend of American liberalism, published some forty-four articles here between 1936 and 1940. He became, in his late 70s, an admirer of Ronald Reagan-but his columns on the subject were full of thoughtful admonitions that liberals hurt only themselves by dismissing the fortieth president as a dunce. And the political philosopher Jean Bethke Elshtain (1941-2013) made the same useful criticisms about the glibness of some radical feminists' deconstructions of \"the family\" in 1979 that she did when she later aligned with George W. Bush. Others, though, evinced one of the ugliest traditions on the left: revolutionary megalomania, the display of a will to power in which the writer embraces radicalism in order to aggrandize himself. A curious note emerges among the admirers of the Soviet experiment who wrote in these pages in the 1930s and '40s. In the Soviet Union and Cuba, the intellectuals who harnessed themselves to the correct side in the battle between socialism and barbarism died as prophets (or, in the case of Trotsky, great martyrs). Back in the United States, writers could secretly imagine the same imminent fate for themselves: that when the revolution came in America, they would become its heroes-or even its leaders. This grandiosity helps explain why apparently intelligent writers would sign on to a project so manifestly unintelligent as America's invasion of Iraq, confident it would go exactly as planned. We find a clue in a children's book published in 1982 by Paul Berman, The Nation 's onetime theater critic, who went on to a career as a self-described \"liberal\" booster of Dick Cheney's adventure in Iraq, framing it as an existential struggle against Islamic fascism. It was called Make-Believe Empire: A How-To Book , and it is described by the Library of Congress as \"A fantasy-craft book which tells how to construct a capital city and an imperial navy.... Provides instructions for writing laws, decrees, proclamations, treaties, and imperial odes.\" Left or right, it doesn't much matter: it sure is a bracing feeling for the chair-bound intellectual to imagine himself the drivetrain in the engine of history. Or at the very least a prophet, standing on the correct side of history and looking down upon moral midgets who insist the world is more complicated than all that. Consider Christopher Hitchens: the former Trotskyist wrote, following his 2002 resignation as a Nation columnist, that by not embracing things like the Iraq War, \" The Nation joined the amoral side.... I say that they stand for neutralism where no such thing is possible or desirable, and I say the hell with it.\" It is the turncoat's greatest gift to his new hosts: the affirmation that the world exists only in black and white. They're the good guys, we're the bad guys. The rest of us can aspire to something better: no more socialist lobotomies.\n\nThis article is part of The Nation 's 150th Anniversary Special Issue .

He doesn't note that two of his intellectual adversaries, Walter and Miriam Schneir, ultimately changed their minds about the case in the face of new evidence. Radosh's political journey follows a familiar pattern, well documented among Nation writers who end their careers on the right: a rigid extremist, possessed of the most over-the-top revolutionary fantasies, comes face to face with the complexity of the real world, then \"changes sides\" and makes his career by hysterically identifying the \"socialist lobotomies\" set as the only kind of leftist there is-ignoring evidence to the contrary that's right in front of his nose. * * * One of the first leftists to abandon the tribe in the pages of The Nation was no less than the magazine's longtime owner and columnist, Oswald Garrison Villard (1872-1949). Villard was such a doctrinaire pacifist that he resigned his column in protest in June 1940 because The Nation favored the United States' rearming to fight Hitler. As he wrote in his valedictory, the magazine had abandoned \"the chief glory of its great and honorable past\": its \"steadfast opposition to all preparations for war.\" He predicted that the course the editors were proposing would \"inevitably end all social and political progress, lower still further the standard of living, enslave labor, and, if persisted in, impose a dictatorship and turn us into a totalitarian state.\" Villard ended up starring in a 1975 book, Prophets on the Right: Profiles of Conservative Critics of American Globalism , whose author happened to be Ronald Radosh. The novelist and critic Granville Hicks (1901-1982) was an orthodox communist who in 1933 published a Marxist history of American literature. In 1940, however, Hicks published an essay in The Nation titled \"The Blind Alley of Marxism,\" in which he excoriated his comrades' unexamined political assumptions. Why, for instance, should \"the elimination of the economic contradictions of capitalism inevitably and automatically [lead] to the higher stage of social development?\" And why, he asked-not long after the Moscow trials railroaded many of the founders of the Soviet state into gulags-do American radicals give \"carte blanche...to a little group of men, five thousand miles away?\" This was thoughtful stuff, but rather than sticking around to nurture a rich debate, Hicks became an eager namer of names to the House Un-American Activities Committee. The culture and history of the left, of course, is shot through with silly, ideologically driven absurdities (\"socialist lobotomies,\" to coin a phrase). There is, for example, the argument Radosh made in The Nation in 1966 that Henry Wallace, perhaps the furthest-left major public official in the history of the United States, was actually a capitalist sellout. Another part of the pattern: the tendency to depict ostensibly revolutionary societies as lands straight out of a fairy tale. Max Eastman (1883-1969), who ended up in the orbit of National Review , filed a dispatch for The Nation in 1923 on a rail journey through Russia whose childlike wonder rivaled a scene from Tom Hanks's The Polar Express . The passport functionary \"was almost magically friendly and gentle.\" The cars were \"wider than railroad cars in America.\" The cabin had \"clean white bed-linen at a mild price, and a friendly young host in a workingman's shirt who came in every once in a while to know if we wouldn't like some tea.\" Some radicals have no problem maturing away from fantasies absorbed at the height of their revolutionary fervor while maintaining the moral core of their commitment to the broader left. Eastman, Radosh and, most famously, Whittaker Chambers (1901-1961), who contributed occasional poems to The Nation in the 1920s, instead went \"all the way.\" Afterward, they projected their own extremism onto the entire left and thus became conservative heroes. This is because they performed a matchless service in letting conservatives ignore the evidence of their senses: that the actual left is thoughtful, humane and diverse. Even if you're a confessed traitor like Chambers, your sins-provided you undergo the proper purification rites-are not an impediment to an embrace from the right, but an advertisement. By bearing witness to the myth that the right's adversaries are more wicked than other conservatives could possibly imagine, you ritualistically renourish the moral Manichaeism without which no right wing worthy of the name can survive. David Horowitz, for example, was an occasional contributor whose first Nation article was a 1964 essay about suicide in Scandinavia. In it, he argued it was no surprise that Swedes and Danes would want to kill themselves-because those countries were still, after all, capitalist nations. He now edits FrontPageMag.com, for which his friend Ronald Radosh publishes articles like \"The American Left: Friends of Our Country's Enemies.\" In 1979, on the cusp of his own apostasy, Horowitz wrote an essay wondering whether the left could ever shed its \"arrogant cloak of self-righteousness that elevates it above its own history and makes it impervious to the lessons of experience.\" That essay, however, was published in The Nation -vitiating his very claim about the arrogant self-righteousness of the left. J. Edgar Hoover once called communism \"a disease that spreads like an epidemic, and like an epidemic, quarantine is necessary to keep it from infecting the nation.\" The apostate from the left adds another crucial detail to that etiology: the idea that the infection is all the more frightening and dangerous because it's invisible, hiding within its host until it finds the opportune moment to do the most damage. Liberalism, like the devil, hides its true face. Thus the slogan of Horowitz's FrontPageMag.com: \"Inside Every Liberal Is a Totalitarian Screaming to Get Out.\" That's how conservatives can depict centrists like Barack Obama and Bill Clinton as aspiring commissars. Didn't Clinton, after all, hire the \"black Marxist Johnnetta [ sic ] Cole,\" as Radosh describes the former president of Spelman College, to direct his transition team for education? Back in the days of Radosh's trip to Cuba, Cole too had been a supporter of Fidel Castro. And so, wrote his friend Eric Breindel in the New York Post , the conclusion was \"inescapable\" that Clinton was not \"interested in distinguishing between a left-liberal and someone who cast her lot with the cause of Communist totalitarianism.\" * * * Of course, plenty of Nation writers traveled rightward with their honor intact. The sociologist Alan Wolfe, once a gentlemanly radical, is now a gentlemanly centrist. He helps to make my point: his contributions to these pages in the 1970s and '80s were resolutely unsilly; he doesn't have to despise leftists now because he never gave himself a reason to despise the leftist he was then. Max Lerner (1902-1992), a towering legend of American liberalism, published some forty-four articles here between 1936 and 1940. He became, in his late 70s, an admirer of Ronald Reagan-but his columns on the subject were full of thoughtful admonitions that liberals hurt only themselves by dismissing the fortieth president as a dunce. And the political philosopher Jean Bethke Elshtain (1941-2013) made the same useful criticisms about the glibness of some radical feminists' deconstructions of \"the family\" in 1979 that she did when she later aligned with George W. Bush. Others, though, evinced one of the ugliest traditions on the left: revolutionary megalomania, the display of a will to power in which the writer embraces radicalism in order to aggrandize himself. A curious note emerges among the admirers of the Soviet experiment who wrote in these pages in the 1930s and '40s. In the Soviet Union and Cuba, the intellectuals who harnessed themselves to the correct side in the battle between socialism and barbarism died as prophets (or, in the case of Trotsky, great martyrs). Back in the United States, writers could secretly imagine the same imminent fate for themselves: that when the revolution came in America, they would become its heroes-or even its leaders. This grandiosity helps explain why apparently intelligent writers would sign on to a project so manifestly unintelligent as America's invasion of Iraq, confident it would go exactly as planned. We find a clue in a children's book published in 1982 by Paul Berman, The Nation 's onetime theater critic, who went on to a career as a self-described \"liberal\" booster of Dick Cheney's adventure in Iraq, framing it as an existential struggle against Islamic fascism. It was called Make-Believe Empire: A How-To Book , and it is described by the Library of Congress as \"A fantasy-craft book which tells how to construct a capital city and an imperial navy.... Provides instructions for writing laws, decrees, proclamations, treaties, and imperial odes.\" Left or right, it doesn't much matter: it sure is a bracing feeling for the chair-bound intellectual to imagine himself the drivetrain in the engine of history. Or at the very least a prophet, standing on the correct side of history and looking down upon moral midgets who insist the world is more complicated than all that. Consider Christopher Hitchens: the former Trotskyist wrote, following his 2002 resignation as a Nation columnist, that by not embracing things like the Iraq War, \" The Nation joined the amoral side.... I say that they stand for neutralism where no such thing is possible or desirable, and I say the hell with it.\" It is the turncoat's greatest gift to his new hosts: the affirmation that the world exists only in black and white. They're the good guys, we're the bad guys. The rest of us can aspire to something better: no more socialist lobotomies.\n\nLater, when sane people were celebrating the end of the Vietnam War, Radosh and those around him regarded the moment as \"an occasion for deep melancholy.\" They liked the Vietnam War, he explained in his memoir, Commies ; it gave their lives meaning. Now that our country was no longer laying waste to Third World peasants, America, for these folks, \"could no longer so easily be called Amerika .\" And now that the exigencies of war could no longer excuse the communists' human-rights abuses, their struggle could no longer be idealized as the heroic effort to create a model Marxist society: \"The idea of an immediate, no-fault revolution, a fantasy of the previous decade, was no longer tenable.\" With that, Radosh doubled down again and traveled to Cuba with a group of revolutionary enthusiasts. One day, they visited a mental hospital.  A doctor there boasted, \"In our institution, we have a larger proportion of hospital inmates who have been lobotomized than any other mental hospital in the world.\" Back on their bus, a flabbergasted therapist exclaimed, \"Lobotomy is a horror. We must do something to stop this.\" Another member of the American  delegation shot back: \"We have to understand that there are differences between capitalist lobotomies and socialist lobotomies.\" Radosh, of course, ended up on the political right. The final straw came when he published a book in 1983 arguing that Julius Rosenberg was indeed guilty of the crime for which he had been executed in 1953. Radosh found himself unfairly attacked from the left. Thus was he moved to \"consider the ultimate heresy: perhaps the Left was wrong not just about the Rosenberg case, but about most everything else....

It was called Make-Believe Empire: A How-To Book , and it is described by the Library of Congress as \"A fantasy-craft book which tells how to construct a capital city and an imperial navy.... Provides instructions for writing laws, decrees, proclamations, treaties, and imperial odes.\" Left or right, it doesn't much matter: it sure is a bracing feeling for the chair-bound intellectual to imagine himself the drivetrain in the engine of history. Or at the very least a prophet, standing on the correct side of history and looking down upon moral midgets who insist the world is more complicated than all that. Consider Christopher Hitchens: the former Trotskyist wrote, following his 2002 resignation as a Nation columnist, that by not embracing things like the Iraq War, \" The Nation joined the amoral side.... I say that they stand for neutralism where no such thing is possible or desirable, and I say the hell with it.\" It is the turncoat's greatest gift to his new hosts: the affirmation that the world exists only in black and white. They're the good guys, we're the bad guys. The rest of us can aspire to something better: no more socialist lobotomies.\n\nRadosh, of course, ended up on the political right. The final straw came when he published a book in 1983 arguing that Julius Rosenberg was indeed guilty of the crime for which he had been executed in 1953. Radosh found himself unfairly attacked from the left. Thus was he moved to \"consider the ultimate heresy: perhaps the Left was wrong not just about the Rosenberg case, but about most everything else.... My journey to America was about to reach its final leg.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → Want to Understand the New Cold War? Look to Huawei.

He doesn't note that two of his intellectual adversaries, Walter and Miriam Schneir, ultimately changed their minds about the case in the face of new evidence. Radosh's political journey follows a familiar pattern, well documented among Nation writers who end their careers on the right: a rigid extremist, possessed of the most over-the-top revolutionary fantasies, comes face to face with the complexity of the real world, then \"changes sides\" and makes his career by hysterically identifying the \"socialist lobotomies\" set as the only kind of leftist there is-ignoring evidence to the contrary that's right in front of his nose. * * * One of the first leftists to abandon the tribe in the pages of The Nation was no less than the magazine's longtime owner and columnist, Oswald Garrison Villard (1872-1949). Villard was such a doctrinaire pacifist that he resigned his column in protest in June 1940 because The Nation favored the United States' rearming to fight Hitler. As he wrote in his valedictory, the magazine had abandoned \"the chief glory of its great and honorable past\": its \"steadfast opposition to all preparations for war.\" He predicted that the course the editors were proposing would \"inevitably end all social and political progress, lower still further the standard of living, enslave labor, and, if persisted in, impose a dictatorship and turn us into a totalitarian state.\" Villard ended up starring in a 1975 book, Prophets on the Right: Profiles of Conservative Critics of American Globalism , whose author happened to be Ronald Radosh. The novelist and critic Granville Hicks (1901-1982) was an orthodox communist who in 1933 published a Marxist history of American literature. In 1940, however, Hicks published an essay in The Nation titled \"The Blind Alley of Marxism,\" in which he excoriated his comrades' unexamined political assumptions. Why, for instance, should \"the elimination of the economic contradictions of capitalism inevitably and automatically [lead] to the higher stage of social development?\" And why, he asked-not long after the Moscow trials railroaded many of the founders of the Soviet state into gulags-do American radicals give \"carte blanche...to a little group of men, five thousand miles away?\" This was thoughtful stuff, but rather than sticking around to nurture a rich debate, Hicks became an eager namer of names to the House Un-American Activities Committee. The culture and history of the left, of course, is shot through with silly, ideologically driven absurdities (\"socialist lobotomies,\" to coin a phrase). There is, for example, the argument Radosh made in The Nation in 1966 that Henry Wallace, perhaps the furthest-left major public official in the history of the United States, was actually a capitalist sellout. Another part of the pattern: the tendency to depict ostensibly revolutionary societies as lands straight out of a fairy tale. Max Eastman (1883-1969), who ended up in the orbit of National Review , filed a dispatch for The Nation in 1923 on a rail journey through Russia whose childlike wonder rivaled a scene from Tom Hanks's The Polar Express . The passport functionary \"was almost magically friendly and gentle.\" The cars were \"wider than railroad cars in America.\" The cabin had \"clean white bed-linen at a mild price, and a friendly young host in a workingman's shirt who came in every once in a while to know if we wouldn't like some tea.\" Some radicals have no problem maturing away from fantasies absorbed at the height of their revolutionary fervor while maintaining the moral core of their commitment to the broader left. Eastman, Radosh and, most famously, Whittaker Chambers (1901-1961), who contributed occasional poems to The Nation in the 1920s, instead went \"all the way.\" Afterward, they projected their own extremism onto the entire left and thus became conservative heroes. This is because they performed a matchless service in letting conservatives ignore the evidence of their senses: that the actual left is thoughtful, humane and diverse. Even if you're a confessed traitor like Chambers, your sins-provided you undergo the proper purification rites-are not an impediment to an embrace from the right, but an advertisement. By bearing witness to the myth that the right's adversaries are more wicked than other conservatives could possibly imagine, you ritualistically renourish the moral Manichaeism without which no right wing worthy of the name can survive. David Horowitz, for example, was an occasional contributor whose first Nation article was a 1964 essay about suicide in Scandinavia. In it, he argued it was no surprise that Swedes and Danes would want to kill themselves-because those countries were still, after all, capitalist nations. He now edits FrontPageMag.com, for which his friend Ronald Radosh publishes articles like \"The American Left: Friends of Our Country's Enemies.\" In 1979, on the cusp of his own apostasy, Horowitz wrote an essay wondering whether the left could ever shed its \"arrogant cloak of self-righteousness that elevates it above its own history and makes it impervious to the lessons of experience.\" That essay, however, was published in The Nation -vitiating his very claim about the arrogant self-righteousness of the left. J. Edgar Hoover once called communism \"a disease that spreads like an epidemic, and like an epidemic, quarantine is necessary to keep it from infecting the nation.\" The apostate from the left adds another crucial detail to that etiology: the idea that the infection is all the more frightening and dangerous because it's invisible, hiding within its host until it finds the opportune moment to do the most damage. Liberalism, like the devil, hides its true face. Thus the slogan of Horowitz's FrontPageMag.com: \"Inside Every Liberal Is a Totalitarian Screaming to Get Out.\" That's how conservatives can depict centrists like Barack Obama and Bill Clinton as aspiring commissars. Didn't Clinton, after all, hire the \"black Marxist Johnnetta [ sic ] Cole,\" as Radosh describes the former president of Spelman College, to direct his transition team for education? Back in the days of Radosh's trip to Cuba, Cole too had been a supporter of Fidel Castro. And so, wrote his friend Eric Breindel in the New York Post , the conclusion was \"inescapable\" that Clinton was not \"interested in distinguishing between a left-liberal and someone who cast her lot with the cause of Communist totalitarianism.\" * * * Of course, plenty of Nation writers traveled rightward with their honor intact. The sociologist Alan Wolfe, once a gentlemanly radical, is now a gentlemanly centrist. He helps to make my point: his contributions to these pages in the 1970s and '80s were resolutely unsilly; he doesn't have to despise leftists now because he never gave himself a reason to despise the leftist he was then. Max Lerner (1902-1992), a towering legend of American liberalism, published some forty-four articles here between 1936 and 1940. He became, in his late 70s, an admirer of Ronald Reagan-but his columns on the subject were full of thoughtful admonitions that liberals hurt only themselves by dismissing the fortieth president as a dunce. And the political philosopher Jean Bethke Elshtain (1941-2013) made the same useful criticisms about the glibness of some radical feminists' deconstructions of \"the family\" in 1979 that she did when she later aligned with George W. Bush. Others, though, evinced one of the ugliest traditions on the left: revolutionary megalomania, the display of a will to power in which the writer embraces radicalism in order to aggrandize himself. A curious note emerges among the admirers of the Soviet experiment who wrote in these pages in the 1930s and '40s. In the Soviet Union and Cuba, the intellectuals who harnessed themselves to the correct side in the battle between socialism and barbarism died as prophets (or, in the case of Trotsky, great martyrs). Back in the United States, writers could secretly imagine the same imminent fate for themselves: that when the revolution came in America, they would become its heroes-or even its leaders. This grandiosity helps explain why apparently intelligent writers would sign on to a project so manifestly unintelligent as America's invasion of Iraq, confident it would go exactly as planned.

The passport functionary \"was almost magically friendly and gentle.\" The cars were \"wider than railroad cars in America.\" The cabin had \"clean white bed-linen at a mild price, and a friendly young host in a workingman's shirt who came in every once in a while to know if we wouldn't like some tea.\" Some radicals have no problem maturing away from fantasies absorbed at the height of their revolutionary fervor while maintaining the moral core of their commitment to the broader left. Eastman, Radosh and, most famously, Whittaker Chambers (1901-1961), who contributed occasional poems to The Nation in the 1920s, instead went \"all the way.\" Afterward, they projected their own extremism onto the entire left and thus became conservative heroes. This is because they performed a matchless service in letting conservatives ignore the evidence of their senses: that the actual left is thoughtful, humane and diverse. Even if you're a confessed traitor like Chambers, your sins-provided you undergo the proper purification rites-are not an impediment to an embrace from the right, but an advertisement. By bearing witness to the myth that the right's adversaries are more wicked than other conservatives could possibly imagine, you ritualistically renourish the moral Manichaeism without which no right wing worthy of the name can survive. David Horowitz, for example, was an occasional contributor whose first Nation article was a 1964 essay about suicide in Scandinavia. In it, he argued it was no surprise that Swedes and Danes would want to kill themselves-because those countries were still, after all, capitalist nations. He now edits FrontPageMag.com, for which his friend Ronald Radosh publishes articles like \"The American Left: Friends of Our Country's Enemies.\" In 1979, on the cusp of his own apostasy, Horowitz wrote an essay wondering whether the left could ever shed its \"arrogant cloak of self-righteousness that elevates it above its own history and makes it impervious to the lessons of experience.\" That essay, however, was published in The Nation -vitiating his very claim about the arrogant self-righteousness of the left. J. Edgar Hoover once called communism \"a disease that spreads like an epidemic, and like an epidemic, quarantine is necessary to keep it from infecting the nation.\" The apostate from the left adds another crucial detail to that etiology: the idea that the infection is all the more frightening and dangerous because it's invisible, hiding within its host until it finds the opportune moment to do the most damage. Liberalism, like the devil, hides its true face. Thus the slogan of Horowitz's FrontPageMag.com: \"Inside Every Liberal Is a Totalitarian Screaming to Get Out.\" That's how conservatives can depict centrists like Barack Obama and Bill Clinton as aspiring commissars. Didn't Clinton, after all, hire the \"black Marxist Johnnetta [ sic ] Cole,\" as Radosh describes the former president of Spelman College, to direct his transition team for education? Back in the days of Radosh's trip to Cuba, Cole too had been a supporter of Fidel Castro. And so, wrote his friend Eric Breindel in the New York Post , the conclusion was \"inescapable\" that Clinton was not \"interested in distinguishing between a left-liberal and someone who cast her lot with the cause of Communist totalitarianism.\" * * * Of course, plenty of Nation writers traveled rightward with their honor intact. The sociologist Alan Wolfe, once a gentlemanly radical, is now a gentlemanly centrist. He helps to make my point: his contributions to these pages in the 1970s and '80s were resolutely unsilly; he doesn't have to despise leftists now because he never gave himself a reason to despise the leftist he was then. Max Lerner (1902-1992), a towering legend of American liberalism, published some forty-four articles here between 1936 and 1940. He became, in his late 70s, an admirer of Ronald Reagan-but his columns on the subject were full of thoughtful admonitions that liberals hurt only themselves by dismissing the fortieth president as a dunce. And the political philosopher Jean Bethke Elshtain (1941-2013) made the same useful criticisms about the glibness of some radical feminists' deconstructions of \"the family\" in 1979 that she did when she later aligned with George W. Bush. Others, though, evinced one of the ugliest traditions on the left: revolutionary megalomania, the display of a will to power in which the writer embraces radicalism in order to aggrandize himself. A curious note emerges among the admirers of the Soviet experiment who wrote in these pages in the 1930s and '40s. In the Soviet Union and Cuba, the intellectuals who harnessed themselves to the correct side in the battle between socialism and barbarism died as prophets (or, in the case of Trotsky, great martyrs). Back in the United States, writers could secretly imagine the same imminent fate for themselves: that when the revolution came in America, they would become its heroes-or even its leaders. This grandiosity helps explain why apparently intelligent writers would sign on to a project so manifestly unintelligent as America's invasion of Iraq, confident it would go exactly as planned. We find a clue in a children's book published in 1982 by Paul Berman, The Nation 's onetime theater critic, who went on to a career as a self-described \"liberal\" booster of Dick Cheney's adventure in Iraq, framing it as an existential struggle against Islamic fascism. It was called Make-Believe Empire: A How-To Book , and it is described by the Library of Congress as \"A fantasy-craft book which tells how to construct a capital city and an imperial navy.... Provides instructions for writing laws, decrees, proclamations, treaties, and imperial odes.\" Left or right, it doesn't much matter: it sure is a bracing feeling for the chair-bound intellectual to imagine himself the drivetrain in the engine of history. Or at the very least a prophet, standing on the correct side of history and looking down upon moral midgets who insist the world is more complicated than all that. Consider Christopher Hitchens: the former Trotskyist wrote, following his 2002 resignation as a Nation columnist, that by not embracing things like the Iraq War, \" The Nation joined the amoral side.... I say that they stand for neutralism where no such thing is possible or desirable, and I say the hell with it.\" It is the turncoat's greatest gift to his new hosts: the affirmation that the world exists only in black and white. They're the good guys, we're the bad guys. The rest of us can aspire to something better: no more socialist lobotomies.\n\nOne of the first leftists to abandon the tribe in the pages of The Nation was no less than the magazine's longtime owner and columnist, Oswald Garrison Villard (1872-1949). Villard was such a doctrinaire pacifist that he resigned his column in protest in June 1940 because The Nation favored the United States' rearming to fight Hitler. As he wrote in his valedictory, the magazine had abandoned \"the chief glory of its great and honorable past\": its \"steadfast opposition to all preparations for war.\" He predicted that the course the editors were proposing would \"inevitably end all social and political progress, lower still further the standard of living, enslave labor, and, if persisted in, impose a dictatorship and turn us into a totalitarian state.\" Villard ended up starring in a 1975 book, Prophets on the Right: Profiles of Conservative Critics of American Globalism , whose author happened to be Ronald Radosh. The novelist and critic Granville Hicks (1901-1982) was an orthodox communist who in 1933 published a Marxist history of American literature. In 1940, however, Hicks published an essay in The Nation titled \"The Blind Alley of Marxism,\" in which he excoriated his comrades' unexamined political assumptions. Why, for instance, should \"the elimination of the economic contradictions of capitalism inevitably and automatically [lead] to the higher stage of social development?\" And why, he asked-not long after the Moscow trials railroaded many of the founders of the Soviet state into gulags-do American radicals give \"carte blanche...to a little group of men, five thousand miles away?\" This was thoughtful stuff, but rather than sticking around to nurture a rich debate, Hicks became an eager namer of names to the House Un-American Activities Committee. The culture and history of the left, of course, is shot through with silly, ideologically driven absurdities (\"socialist lobotomies,\" to coin a phrase). There is, for example, the argument Radosh made in The Nation in 1966 that Henry Wallace, perhaps the furthest-left major public official in the history of the United States, was actually a capitalist sellout. Another part of the pattern: the tendency to depict ostensibly revolutionary societies as lands straight out of a fairy tale.

The rest of us can aspire to something better: no more socialist lobotomies.\n\nDavid Horowitz, for example, was an occasional contributor whose first Nation article was a 1964 essay about suicide in Scandinavia. In it, he argued it was no surprise that Swedes and Danes would want to kill themselves-because those countries were still, after all, capitalist nations. He now edits FrontPageMag.com, for which his friend Ronald Radosh publishes articles like \"The American Left: Friends of Our Country's Enemies.\" In 1979, on the cusp of his own apostasy, Horowitz wrote an essay wondering whether the left could ever shed its \"arrogant cloak of self-righteousness that elevates it above its own history and makes it impervious to the lessons of experience.\" That essay, however, was published in The Nation -vitiating his very claim about the arrogant self-righteousness of the left. J. Edgar Hoover once called communism \"a disease that spreads like an epidemic, and like an epidemic, quarantine is necessary to keep it from infecting the nation.\" The apostate from the left adds another crucial detail to that etiology: the idea that the infection is all the more frightening and dangerous because it's invisible, hiding within its host until it finds the opportune moment to do the most damage. Liberalism, like the devil, hides its true face. Thus the slogan of Horowitz's FrontPageMag.com: \"Inside Every Liberal Is a Totalitarian Screaming to Get Out.\" That's how conservatives can depict centrists like Barack Obama and Bill Clinton as aspiring commissars. Didn't Clinton, after all, hire the \"black Marxist Johnnetta [ sic ] Cole,\" as Radosh describes the former president of Spelman College, to direct his transition team for education? Back in the days of Radosh's trip to Cuba, Cole too had been a supporter of Fidel Castro. And so, wrote his friend Eric Breindel in the New York Post , the conclusion was \"inescapable\" that Clinton was not \"interested in distinguishing between a left-liberal and someone who cast her lot with the cause of Communist totalitarianism.\" * * * Of course, plenty of Nation writers traveled rightward with their honor intact. The sociologist Alan Wolfe, once a gentlemanly radical, is now a gentlemanly centrist. He helps to make my point: his contributions to these pages in the 1970s and '80s were resolutely unsilly; he doesn't have to despise leftists now because he never gave himself a reason to despise the leftist he was then. Max Lerner (1902-1992), a towering legend of American liberalism, published some forty-four articles here between 1936 and 1940.

Activate your online access\n\nAgainst the radical, if reactionary, experiment run from the White House, everyone from Democratic leaders in Congress to MSNBC hosts have turned to the defense of institutions.\n\nBefore they became sycophants of Donald Trump, American conservatives revered the writings of Edmund Burke, the 18th century Anglo-Irish philosopher and parliamentarian, who penned a famous takedown of the French Revolution. Burke \"aligned himself with institutions of order and stability (and tradition) when he sensed chaos, mob rule or radical experimentation,\" according to historian Drew Maciag, \"when those who sought power acted irresponsibly or unjustly.\"\n\nToday, most Democrats-and quite a few progressives-sound a similar alarm. They charge that the president, abetted by Elon Musk and his eager young DOGEiacs, are wrecking federal institutions established in the 1960s (like JFK's US Agency for International Development and LBJ's Medicaid) and even as far back as the 1930s (such as FDR's National Labor Relations Board). They fire tens of thousands of workers without cause, and imperil benefits many Americans have taken for granted. Meanwhile, with help from the courts, Trump is doing away with affirmative action, DEI programs, and the civil rights of transgender people. Blasting away at \"the climate hoax,\" he and his party are rapidly eliminating any environmental program that limits the development and use of fossil fuels. And don't forget Trump's pardon of every January 6 lawbreaker who committed one of the most blatant attempts at \"mob rule\" in US history.\n\nIn protesting these outrages, liberals and many leftists have become the new conservatives. Against the radical, if utterly reactionary, experiment being run from the White House and cheered on by the MAGA faithful, everyone from Democratic leaders in Congress to the hosts at MSNBC-and even some writers for magazines like this one-resort to an anxious defense of prominent institutions. Last month, Elie Mystal hailed independent regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission as \"the only real day-to-day check on unrestrained capitalism in our system of government,\" while Chuck Schumer recently blasted the idea of abolishing the Department of Education by executive order as \"one of the most destructive and devastating steps that Donald Trump has ever taken.\"\n\nEssential as it is to defend institutions that millions of Americans need, that alone will not address why so many working-class people-particularly, but not only, white ones-have soured on both partisan Democrats and on some causes left activists fought to win, or gains they seek to preserve. Although immigration did much to make the United States a wealthy and powerful nation, most ordinary citizens now believe Trump's charge that \"illegal\" migrants threaten their jobs and culture. Only when progressives demonstrate that they care deeply about their constituents' current and future well-being will the decent truth have a chance to break through the wall of lies. An effective political strategy must always be grounded in collective self-interest.\n\nWe have to think anew about how to win the trust of Americans who have good reasons to be cynical and angry about the current state of the nation. Just repeating the same rhetoric from the past, while simply defending agencies they know little about, won't respond to that mood or respond effectively to the current crisis.\n\nOne approach would be to highlight programs like pre-kindergarten for all kids and tax credits for childcare that Republicans killed in the cradle when Biden was president. Another would be to champion ideas that would have wide appeal-but have never been attempted: class-based affirmative action and subsidies for rent in urban areas. And how many people not named Musk or Bezos would oppose Elizabeth Warren's \"wealth tax\" on the 75,000 richest Americans which the Massachusetts senator predicts would raise close to $4 trillion in a decade?\n\nAny chosen policy ought to offer a fresh approach to narrowing the gap between classes and be available, like Social Security, to everyone regardless of need. The animating vision might be borrowed from the chorus of Bruce Springsteen's 2012 song:\n\nWe take care of our own We take care of our own Wherever this flag's flown We take care of our own.\n\nOne can wish that nationalism would fade away, sometime in the future. But as long as most Americans identify with and want to be proud of their country, a nationalism of caring is the best alternative to the nativist scare-mongering of the MAGA mogul. Anyone whose embrace of Trumpism derives primarily from a hatred of immigrants or transgender people will be beyond the reach of this strategy. But surveys and exit polls from last fall's election show that anxiety about the economy was far more common than fears about cultural displacement.\n\nOne cause of the discontent so evident among working-class Americans during this century will be among the most difficult-and also the most essential-to address. How will they and their children find occupations that offer an adequate income and some potential for improvement in an economy that already doles out vastly greater rewards to those with at least a college degree in a technical, scientific, or financial field? As artificial intelligence turns \"good\" jobs in manufacturing and health care into menial ones-or eliminates them altogether-more and more people will have to take low-paid positions in service or retail that require a relentlessly sunny demeanor that can actually breed resentment and cynicism. Part-time workers already hold an increasing number of those occupations. Unions have always had a difficult time organizing the women and men who hold down such jobs; they tend to be temporary workers and do not develop the pride in one's craft or expertise that promotes a feeling of solidarity among, say, autoworkers or nurses.\n\nThroughout his three terms in the Senate from Ohio, Sherrod Brown paid tribute to \"the dignity of work\" and won praise as the most stalwart and eloquent champion of unions in that body. In 2021, he sponsored a bill that compelled the federal government to fund multi-employer pension plans that became insolvent. In his final speech on the Senate floor , Brown insisted:\n\nTrue populism is about the dignity of work-putting workers at the center. And when I talk about workers, I mean ALL workers-whether you punch a clock or swipe a badge. Whether you're on salary or working for tips. Whether you're going to school or raising children or caring for an aging parent. No matter who you are, no matter where you live, no matter what kind of work you do-your work has dignity.\n\nYet Brown, who lost his seat to a wealthy car dealer and tech executive, did not explain how American workers would nurture that sense of dignity while toiling at the kind of low-wage jobs available to most of those with just a high-school education or less. To drive customers around town at all hours, field anxious complaints at farflung call centers, serve coffee and pastries to rushing commuters, or package all manner of items at a massive warehouse does not often allow the simple satisfaction of a job well done, let alone provide a sense of dignity. Yet, as artificial intelligence advances, many of those jobs may not survive either. That an ever increasing share of national income goes to investments instead of wages adds another layer of insecurity to the lack of self-esteem at work. Sadly, few members of Congress show Brown's steadfast commitment to either the dignity of labor-or to finding serious ways to address the blatant injuries of class.\n\nPoliticians and movement activists who do not merely promise to change that reality but make a serious effort to do so deserve admiration as well as electoral and popular success. Otherwise, working-class Americans will probably keep swinging between contempt for politicians in general and a passing fancy for performers who boast without evidence that they know how to make a country rife with division and discontent \"great again.\"\n\nWe may not have it in our power to begin the world over again,\" as Tom Paine, Burke's great antagonist, predicted back in 1776. But by talking consistently and with genuine empathy about how to solve the problem of work in the tech-driven economy-and by coming up with policies that address it-we may be able to turn back the pessimism and despair that grips both the left and the people who will decide its fate, and that of the nation.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Spanberger, who just won a close reelection in Virginia, is one of several prominent moderates within the party who are blaming progressives and the left for why Democrats lost seats in the House of Representatives and failed to gain a majority in the Senate. Pennsylvania Representative Conor Lamb, who also survived a close race, is another. He concluded in a recent interview , \"Moving forward, we can't be talking about socialism and defunding the police. We need to talk about things people like the sound of, things we can get done.\" After several years of leftist grassroots mobilization, including a historic summer of unprecedented racial justice protests (ones that saw liberals marching alongside leftists), moderates are pushing hard to move the party away from the left. But in trying to distance itself from slogans such as \" Defund the police ,\" Democratic centrists (and some liberals) are conjuring a caricature of the left that distorts more than reveals the reasons for the party's minority status and for its losses down-ballot. This is because the Democratic Party's past electoral and legislative successes were largely achieved by members who expanded the coalitional boundaries and political imagination of the party because of their identification with the left. The Democratic Party has achieved electoral success because of, while remaining internally hostile to, the left-and left-wing activists-for much of its history since the New Deal.

Many of the Democratic Party's historic victories-on civil rights, women's rights, and economic justice-are due to the leftward shift after the Great Depression of many of its members who entered the party as liberals and embraced leftist ideas or who eschewed (or left) the Democratic Party as self-identified leftists but continued to work alongside liberal Democrats. From W.E.B. Du Bois to Henry Wallace to Shirley Chisholm to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the party is indebted to those progressive leaders-particularly progressives of color -who, when faced with growing inequality in a time of unprecedented prosperity, transformed their personal politics, and the United States in the process. Their demands were often labeled extreme by centrist or \"moderate\" members of their own party, but they continued to push the ideological boundaries of liberalism.

It fails to capitalize on left-wing sentiments expressed by liberals in the electorate who do not yet identify as leftists but echo left positions on issues like policing . For just as in the 1950s and '60s, prolonged periods of racial and economic inequality over the past 20 years have pushed liberals leftward, which has forced the party to reckon with America's inadequacies on issues of class and race, the limits of unfettered capitalism, and the party's inability to deliver economic rights and social justice to Black Americans, women, and immigrants. The Democratic Party will fail to produce meaningful change for its most vital constituents if it continues to reinforce rigid intraparty boundaries and static notions of the left that excludes figures willing to join and lead multiracial movements for social justice. Its claims to inclusion will be gestural and moot, setting the party up for long-term failures beyond 2020. T he liberal-to-left lineage in the Democratic Party has a long history that dates back to the Industrial Revolution. Du Bois, for instance, first sought to redress racial inequality through racial uplift, mobilizing an educated class of Blacks to lead the movement for racial justice. In 1912, Du Bois encouraged his readers to back Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson because of his campaign's promise to support the cause of Black people in the United States. \"Under Wilson came the worst attempt at Jim Crow legislation and discrimination in civil service that we had experienced since the Civil War,\" wrote Du Bois in his 1956 essay \" I Won't Vote .\" Looking back at his history of voting, Du Bois concluded that \"there is but one evil party with two names, and it will be elected despite all I can do or say.\" Du Bois's path led him to join the Communist Party in 1961, and made him a leading figure in the fight for racial justice in the 20th century. But his ideological trajectory reflects the challenges and decisions faced by other progressive leaders who were either kept outside of the party's big tent or attempted to redefine it. Eugene V. Debs, a former Democrat who served in Indiana's state Senate during the 1880s, became an avowed socialist after the Pullman Strike and formed the Socialist Party of America, running for president as the Socialist Party nominee four times-in 1904, 1908, 1912, and 1920. Believing that both political parties ultimately represented the capitalist class, Debs fought for socialism outside the Democratic Party for the rest of his life. Current Issue View our current issue Subsequent liberals were radicalized by the Great Depression and, inspired by FDR's New Deal, sought change within the party, not outside of it. Once a supporter of the progressive wing of the Republican Party, Henry Wallace moved left in response to rampant inequality in the 1920s and embraced FDR's efforts to \"save capitalism\" through the New Deal as his secretary of agriculture. Wallace initially resisted some of the New Deal's most ambitious economic reforms, but shifted to the left in the mid-1930s, combining an agrarian populism with a robust progressive internationalism. As a Democrat turned Progressive Party candidate for president in 1948, Wallace championed the end of Jim Crow segregation, outflanking Democrats on matters of racial inequality. This is turn encouraged liberal Democrat Hubert Humphrey to denounce racial segregation on behalf of his party at the Democratic National Convention that year. Indeed, activists like Du Bois supported Franklin D. Roosevelt's ability to give Black Americans \"a kind of recognition in political life which the Negro had never before received,\" all while maintaining fierce criticism of the New Deal's lack of interest in civil rights (and federal relief) for them. The shift in the party's positions on racial-and economic-equality opened avenues for liberals' engagement in the rights revolutions of the 1960s. Figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and Betty Friedan (a Wallace supporter who first worked within Democratic Party politics as a journalist in the labor movement) forced liberals to buckle to demands for an end to discrimination in employment, with figures like King actively working with Democrats and moderate liberals like Lyndon Johnson on civil rights legislation. As the United States experienced a golden age of capitalism-an \" age of compression \" caused by the postwar economic boom-forces on the left mobilized on behalf of distributive policies that achieved racial justice and gender equity. Biden and the Left Progressives, Get Ready to Push Biden and Harris Katrina vanden Heuvel The Democratic Party's confrontation with the rights revolutions continued into the 1970s, with liberals moving to the left wing of the party in response to the center's continued dependence on Southern Democrats and structural resistance to empowering women and Black people. In the wake of Kamala Harris's victory, Shirley Chisholm was cited as a pathbreaker ; her 1972 presidential candidacy was the first ever by a Black woman. But at the time, Chisholm's politics (\" Welfare Not Warfare ,\" support for LGBTQ rights) were eschewed by party leaders, and her candidacy and vision of a multiracial, working-class party viewed as too radical by many Democrats. Chisholm expressed frustration with the party's hesitance to embrace Black women leaders (and more progressive policies), leading her to abandon any liberal bona fides before her presidential run in 1972. \"I have already moved away from being a moderate, a liberal . My frustrations at trying to operate through channels and following the prescribed procedures, and failing to get any action, have radicalized me.\" As she took her campaign throughout the country in 1972, she encountered resistance from moderate Black Democrats who claimed that \" a vote for Shirley Chisholm is a vote for George Wallace .\" Yet Chisholm's candidacy, and her politics, laid the groundwork for liberal to left movements in the Democratic Party, including Jesse Jackson's presidential campaigns. Sixteen years after Martin Luther King Jr.'s Poor People's Campaign, Jesse Jackson sought to carry the multiracial progressive tradition into a new era with his 1984 and '88 presidential campaigns. Operating in the \" Age of Reagan ,\" Jackson pleaded with Democrats not to ignore the voters who made up his coalition. \"My constituency is the desperate, the damned, the disinherited, the disrespected, and the despised. They are restless and seek relief. The Democratic Party must send them a signal that we care,\" said Jackson during his 1984 Democratic convention speech. This history has shaped modern day liberal-to-left converts who have successfully channeled today's grassroots energy into the Democratic Party. A year before her stunning upset over establishment stalwart Joe Crowley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a former college intern for Ted Kennedy, cited her distaste for the influence of money in politics and her own economic hardships as reasons she decided to focus on left activism. After organizing for the Bernie Sanders campaign in the Bronx in 2016, she \"hopped in a car and began sitting down with everyday people across the country to explore pressing issues facing our communities: we went to Flint, MI; Standing Rock, South Dakota; and Puerto Rico,\" she said in an interview with National Hispanic Institute Magazine . Ocasio-Cortez is not alone; her experiences echo the growth of progressive politics since 2008. The Party Progressives Are an Asset for the Democratic Party. It Should Treat Them That Way. Katrina vanden Heuvel At the same time, leftist organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) offer space for liberal-left converts. With its more than 85,000 members, DSA has actively encouraged young people on the left to focus on local electoral politics and been instrumental in galvanizing the Democratic Party's base. The organization has experienced another surge in membership this year, as Covid-19 has led more people to question a market-based approach to a global pandemic. \"If the markets can't even produce hand sanitizer or toilet paper or masks during a plague-what good is this system?\" asked one DSA cochair in Detroit. But even as American inequality (which shows no signs of receding) has regularly pushed liberals leftward, contributing to the growth of a liberal-left constituency within the Democratic Party, it has yet to force the party to create a legislative agenda that addresses racial and economic justice for most Americans. A bloc of left-leaning progressives in Congress, many of them women of color (Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and now Cori Bush), have shaped a new generation of social movements, often through their own grassroots activism . They regularly encounter intransigence from moderates and liberals who default to the party's powerlessness as the baseline for electoral strategies. Given this reality, the post-Trump challenge for the Democratic Party will be to support its constituents across the left-wing spectrum, particularly Democratic candidates who recognize that addressing the issue of inequality gets results at the ballot box , which will build enduring coalitions beyond it. If the Democratic Party is to significantly expand its political tent-even if that exposes it to charges of \"socialism\"-and roll back a revanchist right-wing movement, it must recognize its historical debt to those individuals who have personally moved left, shaping the collective possibilities for the Democratic Party and all of its members to enact meaningful social change.\n\nAfter several years of leftist grassroots mobilization, including a historic summer of unprecedented racial justice protests (ones that saw liberals marching alongside leftists), moderates are pushing hard to move the party away from the left.

Du Bois, for instance, first sought to redress racial inequality through racial uplift, mobilizing an educated class of Blacks to lead the movement for racial justice. In 1912, Du Bois encouraged his readers to back Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson because of his campaign's promise to support the cause of Black people in the United States. \"Under Wilson came the worst attempt at Jim Crow legislation and discrimination in civil service that we had experienced since the Civil War,\" wrote Du Bois in his 1956 essay \" I Won't Vote .\" Looking back at his history of voting, Du Bois concluded that \"there is but one evil party with two names, and it will be elected despite all I can do or say.\" Du Bois's path led him to join the Communist Party in 1961, and made him a leading figure in the fight for racial justice in the 20th century. But his ideological trajectory reflects the challenges and decisions faced by other progressive leaders who were either kept outside of the party's big tent or attempted to redefine it. Eugene V. Debs, a former Democrat who served in Indiana's state Senate during the 1880s, became an avowed socialist after the Pullman Strike and formed the Socialist Party of America, running for president as the Socialist Party nominee four times-in 1904, 1908, 1912, and 1920. Believing that both political parties ultimately represented the capitalist class, Debs fought for socialism outside the Democratic Party for the rest of his life. Current Issue View our current issue Subsequent liberals were radicalized by the Great Depression and, inspired by FDR's New Deal, sought change within the party, not outside of it. Once a supporter of the progressive wing of the Republican Party, Henry Wallace moved left in response to rampant inequality in the 1920s and embraced FDR's efforts to \"save capitalism\" through the New Deal as his secretary of agriculture. Wallace initially resisted some of the New Deal's most ambitious economic reforms, but shifted to the left in the mid-1930s, combining an agrarian populism with a robust progressive internationalism. As a Democrat turned Progressive Party candidate for president in 1948, Wallace championed the end of Jim Crow segregation, outflanking Democrats on matters of racial inequality. This is turn encouraged liberal Democrat Hubert Humphrey to denounce racial segregation on behalf of his party at the Democratic National Convention that year. Indeed, activists like Du Bois supported Franklin D. Roosevelt's ability to give Black Americans \"a kind of recognition in political life which the Negro had never before received,\" all while maintaining fierce criticism of the New Deal's lack of interest in civil rights (and federal relief) for them. The shift in the party's positions on racial-and economic-equality opened avenues for liberals' engagement in the rights revolutions of the 1960s. Figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and Betty Friedan (a Wallace supporter who first worked within Democratic Party politics as a journalist in the labor movement) forced liberals to buckle to demands for an end to discrimination in employment, with figures like King actively working with Democrats and moderate liberals like Lyndon Johnson on civil rights legislation. As the United States experienced a golden age of capitalism-an \" age of compression \" caused by the postwar economic boom-forces on the left mobilized on behalf of distributive policies that achieved racial justice and gender equity. Biden and the Left Progressives, Get Ready to Push Biden and Harris Katrina vanden Heuvel The Democratic Party's confrontation with the rights revolutions continued into the 1970s, with liberals moving to the left wing of the party in response to the center's continued dependence on Southern Democrats and structural resistance to empowering women and Black people. In the wake of Kamala Harris's victory, Shirley Chisholm was cited as a pathbreaker ; her 1972 presidential candidacy was the first ever by a Black woman. But at the time, Chisholm's politics (\" Welfare Not Warfare ,\" support for LGBTQ rights) were eschewed by party leaders, and her candidacy and vision of a multiracial, working-class party viewed as too radical by many Democrats. Chisholm expressed frustration with the party's hesitance to embrace Black women leaders (and more progressive policies), leading her to abandon any liberal bona fides before her presidential run in 1972. \"I have already moved away from being a moderate, a liberal . My frustrations at trying to operate through channels and following the prescribed procedures, and failing to get any action, have radicalized me.\" As she took her campaign throughout the country in 1972, she encountered resistance from moderate Black Democrats who claimed that \" a vote for Shirley Chisholm is a vote for George Wallace .\" Yet Chisholm's candidacy, and her politics, laid the groundwork for liberal to left movements in the Democratic Party, including Jesse Jackson's presidential campaigns. Sixteen years after Martin Luther King Jr.'s Poor People's Campaign, Jesse Jackson sought to carry the multiracial progressive tradition into a new era with his 1984 and '88 presidential campaigns. Operating in the \" Age of Reagan ,\" Jackson pleaded with Democrats not to ignore the voters who made up his coalition. \"My constituency is the desperate, the damned, the disinherited, the disrespected, and the despised. They are restless and seek relief. The Democratic Party must send them a signal that we care,\" said Jackson during his 1984 Democratic convention speech. This history has shaped modern day liberal-to-left converts who have successfully channeled today's grassroots energy into the Democratic Party. A year before her stunning upset over establishment stalwart Joe Crowley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a former college intern for Ted Kennedy, cited her distaste for the influence of money in politics and her own economic hardships as reasons she decided to focus on left activism. After organizing for the Bernie Sanders campaign in the Bronx in 2016, she \"hopped in a car and began sitting down with everyday people across the country to explore pressing issues facing our communities: we went to Flint, MI; Standing Rock, South Dakota; and Puerto Rico,\" she said in an interview with National Hispanic Institute Magazine . Ocasio-Cortez is not alone; her experiences echo the growth of progressive politics since 2008. The Party Progressives Are an Asset for the Democratic Party. It Should Treat Them That Way. Katrina vanden Heuvel At the same time, leftist organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) offer space for liberal-left converts. With its more than 85,000 members, DSA has actively encouraged young people on the left to focus on local electoral politics and been instrumental in galvanizing the Democratic Party's base. The organization has experienced another surge in membership this year, as Covid-19 has led more people to question a market-based approach to a global pandemic. \"If the markets can't even produce hand sanitizer or toilet paper or masks during a plague-what good is this system?\" asked one DSA cochair in Detroit. But even as American inequality (which shows no signs of receding) has regularly pushed liberals leftward, contributing to the growth of a liberal-left constituency within the Democratic Party, it has yet to force the party to create a legislative agenda that addresses racial and economic justice for most Americans. A bloc of left-leaning progressives in Congress, many of them women of color (Ilhan Omar, Rashida Tlaib, and now Cori Bush), have shaped a new generation of social movements, often through their own grassroots activism . They regularly encounter intransigence from moderates and liberals who default to the party's powerlessness as the baseline for electoral strategies. Given this reality, the post-Trump challenge for the Democratic Party will be to support its constituents across the left-wing spectrum, particularly Democratic candidates who recognize that addressing the issue of inequality gets results at the ballot box , which will build enduring coalitions beyond it. If the Democratic Party is to significantly expand its political tent-even if that exposes it to charges of \"socialism\"-and roll back a revanchist right-wing movement, it must recognize its historical debt to those individuals who have personally moved left, shaping the collective possibilities for the Democratic Party and all of its members to enact meaningful social change.\n\nAnthony Flaccavento and Erica Etelson\n\nKatrina vanden Heuvel and Robert L. Borosage\n\nJeet Heer\n\nThis history of the left within the Democratic Party is presently obscured by moderates immobilized by visions of appealing to a well-defined bloc of center-leaning voters-dreaming that a cadre of virtue-minded crossover GOP voters will save the party on Election Day. This isn't a new fiction; Democrats have long sought to attract voters with bipartisan rhetoric that simultaneously distanced the party from the left while appealing to the \"center.\" In 1992, then-candidate Bill Clinton told voters , \"The choice we offer is not conservative or liberal; in many ways it's not even Republican or Democratic. It's different. It's new. And it will work.\" These moderates campaign and govern the way they do because they are haunted by the ghosts of George McGovern and Ronald Reagan . They implicitly accommodate and impart the conservative notion predominant since the 1960s that Americans dislike \" big government .\" The Democratic Party has resisted forming a meaningful alliance with politicians and activists on the left; and it has ceded ground to moderates reluctant to grant institutional space to leftists to build coalitions within their ranks.

For just as in the 1950s and '60s, prolonged periods of racial and economic inequality over the past 20 years have pushed liberals leftward, which has forced the party to reckon with America's inadequacies on issues of class and race, the limits of unfettered capitalism, and the party's inability to deliver economic rights and social justice to Black Americans, women, and immigrants. The Democratic Party will fail to produce meaningful change for its most vital constituents if it continues to reinforce rigid intraparty boundaries and static notions of the left that excludes figures willing to join and lead multiracial movements for social justice.

They regularly encounter intransigence from moderates and liberals who default to the party's powerlessness as the baseline for electoral strategies. Given this reality, the post-Trump challenge for the Democratic Party will be to support its constituents across the left-wing spectrum, particularly Democratic candidates who recognize that addressing the issue of inequality gets results at the ballot box , which will build enduring coalitions beyond it. If the Democratic Party is to significantly expand its political tent-even if that exposes it to charges of \"socialism\"-and roll back a revanchist right-wing movement, it must recognize its historical debt to those individuals who have personally moved left, shaping the collective possibilities for the Democratic Party and all of its members to enact meaningful social change.\n\nDu Bois's path led him to join the Communist Party in 1961, and made him a leading figure in the fight for racial justice in the 20th century. But his ideological trajectory reflects the challenges and decisions faced by other progressive leaders who were either kept outside of the party's big tent or attempted to redefine it. Eugene V. Debs, a former Democrat who served in Indiana's state Senate during the 1880s, became an avowed socialist after the Pullman Strike and formed the Socialist Party of America, running for president as the Socialist Party nominee four times-in 1904, 1908, 1912, and 1920. Believing that both political parties ultimately represented the capitalist class, Debs fought for socialism outside the Democratic Party for the rest of his life. Current Issue View our current issue Subsequent liberals were radicalized by the Great Depression and, inspired by FDR's New Deal, sought change within the party, not outside of it. Once a supporter of the progressive wing of the Republican Party, Henry Wallace moved left in response to rampant inequality in the 1920s and embraced FDR's efforts to \"save capitalism\" through the New Deal as his secretary of agriculture. Wallace initially resisted some of the New Deal's most ambitious economic reforms, but shifted to the left in the mid-1930s, combining an agrarian populism with a robust progressive internationalism. As a Democrat turned Progressive Party candidate for president in 1948, Wallace championed the end of Jim Crow segregation, outflanking Democrats on matters of racial inequality. This is turn encouraged liberal Democrat Hubert Humphrey to denounce racial segregation on behalf of his party at the Democratic National Convention that year. Indeed, activists like Du Bois supported Franklin D. Roosevelt's ability to give Black Americans \"a kind of recognition in political life which the Negro had never before received,\" all while maintaining fierce criticism of the New Deal's lack of interest in civil rights (and federal relief) for them. The shift in the party's positions on racial-and economic-equality opened avenues for liberals' engagement in the rights revolutions of the 1960s. Figures like Martin Luther King Jr. and Betty Friedan (a Wallace supporter who first worked within Democratic Party politics as a journalist in the labor movement) forced liberals to buckle to demands for an end to discrimination in employment, with figures like King actively working with Democrats and moderate liberals like Lyndon Johnson on civil rights legislation. As the United States experienced a golden age of capitalism-an \" age of compression \" caused by the postwar economic boom-forces on the left mobilized on behalf of distributive policies that achieved racial justice and gender equity. Biden and the Left Progressives, Get Ready to Push Biden and Harris Katrina vanden Heuvel The Democratic Party's confrontation with the rights revolutions continued into the 1970s, with liberals moving to the left wing of the party in response to the center's continued dependence on Southern Democrats and structural resistance to empowering women and Black people. In the wake of Kamala Harris's victory, Shirley Chisholm was cited as a pathbreaker ; her 1972 presidential candidacy was the first ever by a Black woman. But at the time, Chisholm's politics (\" Welfare Not Warfare ,\" support for LGBTQ rights) were eschewed by party leaders, and her candidacy and vision of a multiracial, working-class party viewed as too radical by many Democrats. Chisholm expressed frustration with the party's hesitance to embrace Black women leaders (and more progressive policies), leading her to abandon any liberal bona fides before her presidential run in 1972. \"I have already moved away from being a moderate, a liberal . My frustrations at trying to operate through channels and following the prescribed procedures, and failing to get any action, have radicalized me.\" As she took her campaign throughout the country in 1972, she encountered resistance from moderate Black Democrats who claimed that \" a vote for Shirley Chisholm is a vote for George Wallace .\" Yet Chisholm's candidacy, and her politics, laid the groundwork for liberal to left movements in the Democratic Party, including Jesse Jackson's presidential campaigns. Sixteen years after Martin Luther King Jr.'s Poor People's Campaign, Jesse Jackson sought to carry the multiracial progressive tradition into a new era with his 1984 and '88 presidential campaigns. Operating in the \" Age of Reagan ,\" Jackson pleaded with Democrats not to ignore the voters who made up his coalition. \"My constituency is the desperate, the damned, the disinherited, the disrespected, and the despised. They are restless and seek relief. The Democratic Party must send them a signal that we care,\" said Jackson during his 1984 Democratic convention speech. This history has shaped modern day liberal-to-left converts who have successfully channeled today's grassroots energy into the Democratic Party. A year before her stunning upset over establishment stalwart Joe Crowley, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a former college intern for Ted Kennedy, cited her distaste for the influence of money in politics and her own economic hardships as reasons she decided to focus on left activism. After organizing for the Bernie Sanders campaign in the Bronx in 2016, she \"hopped in a car and began sitting down with everyday people across the country to explore pressing issues facing our communities: we went to Flint, MI; Standing Rock, South Dakota; and Puerto Rico,\" she said in an interview with National Hispanic Institute Magazine . Ocasio-Cortez is not alone; her experiences echo the growth of progressive politics since 2008. The Party Progressives Are an Asset for the Democratic Party. It Should Treat Them That Way. Katrina vanden Heuvel At the same time, leftist organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) offer space for liberal-left converts. With its more than 85,000 members, DSA has actively encouraged young people on the left to focus on local electoral politics and been instrumental in galvanizing the Democratic Party's base.

Activate your online access\n\nWhat is the view of most of the organizations and activists in the Palestinian solidarity movement about Hamas? The answer remains unclear-and rarely talked about.\n\nOne of the things that mystifies me as an Israeli leftist (yes, Virginia, there are leftists in Israel), is the lack of an international leftist critique of Hamas.\n\nJudith Butler said in a panel in Paris on March 3 , \"We can have different views on Hamas as a political party, we can have different views on armed resistance, but I think it is more honest and historically correct to say that the uprising of October 7 was an act of armed resistance.\"\n\nBut what does Butler have to say about the nature of Hamas as a political party or movement? If we have \"different views\" about them, what is her view? It's not clear.\n\nAnd I will add, what is the view of most of the organizations and activists in the Palestinian solidarity movement about Hamas? Also not clear-and rarely talked about.\n\nI say this as an Israeli who believes that the occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem is evil and must end. And for that to happen, in addition to the need for a different Israeli government and serious pressure from the Biden administration and the international community, we also need a realistic Palestinian partner.\n\nHamas is not that partner. According to its own ideology, Hamas wants an Islamic Palestinian state, run according to Sharia (Muslim religious law), \"from the river to the sea.\" While Hamas defines itself as a national movement struggling for Palestinian rights, it also is clearly a fundamentalist Islamic movement, the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood that was founded in Egypt. Therefore, it is not simply a Palestinian liberation movement but also a fundamentalist Islamic movement. Is that what the primarily secular American and international left wants? Don't they believe in the importance of separation of church (religion) and state-a principle currently being challenged by the MAGA movement and evangelists in the United States? As it is by the settler movement here in Israel.\n\nFor those who are not familiar with it, the original Hamas charter when the movement was founded in 1988 was clearly antisemitic, fundamentalist, and totally opposed to compromise with the State of Israel. It stated \"that the land of Palestine is an Islamic Waqf consecrated for future Moslem generations until Judgment Day. It, or any part of it, should not be squandered: it, or any part of it, should not be given up.\" It also stated, \"The Prophet, Allah bless him and grant him salvation, has said: 'The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews, when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.'\" So it was clearly against the right of the State of Israel to exist alongside a Palestinian state, and it was also clearly antisemitic. The charter recognized the Palestine Liberation Organization as a brother organization in the struggle (Hamas is not a member) but rejected the PLO's secular character and support for a democratic secular state, since it asserted that \"we cannot give up the Islamic identity of Palestine.\"\n\nWinning the Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006, Hamas took over total control of government of Gaza after a vicious civil war with Fatah that included throwing Fatah activists off roofs of buildings and shooting them in their kneecaps so they couldn't walk again. In 2017, Hamas published a revised version of the charter that expressed support for \"a fully sovereign and independent Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital along the lines of the 4th of June 1967, with the return of the refugees and the displaced to their homes from which they were expelled, to be a formula of national consensus.\" However, it did not express a readiness to recognize the existence of the State of Israel. It also removed the clearly antisemitic elements in the first charter, saying that \"Hamas affirms that its conflict is with the Zionist project not with the Jews because of their religion.\"\n\nAt the time, Hamas proposed a hudna (long-term cease-fire) with the Israelis, even up to 50 years. In response, the Israeli government, perhaps understandably, said it would only agree to a full peace agreement with the Palestinians like the ones Israel has with Egypt and Jordan.\n\nWas that a mistake, a missed opportunity on the part of Israel? Perhaps. Then again, the fact that Palestinian President Yasir Arafat didn't accept Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's offer at Camp David in 2000 , and that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas didn't say yes to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's even more generous offer in 2007-08-weren't those mistakes as well?\n\nIsraelis and Palestinians share responsibility for missed opportunities.\n\nOn September 30, 2021, a few months after one of the periodic Israel-Gaza mini-wars, Hamas organized the \"Promise of the Hereafter\" conference at the Commodore Hotel in Gaza City, which dealt with the group's plans for the day after the conquest and destruction of the State of Israel and the establishment of a Palestinian state in its place. In April 2024, senior Fatah members based in Cairo told Haaretz journalist Shlomi Eldar that they thought the Hamas people were crazy when they came to them after the conference suggesting that they assume responsibility for professional roles in the new Palestinian state that would replace Israel.\n\nWe now know that Hamas was preparing the October 7 attack for more than a year. Was its goal to strike a blow at the Zionist enemy, to prevent a normalization agreement between Israel and Saudi Arabia, to demonstrate that violence, and not diplomacy, was the only way to successfully struggle for Palestinian rights? Possibly a combination of all of the above and more. And it also knew that the Israeli military response, with a vastly superior force, would be deadly for the Palestinians in Gaza. To my mind, one of the most astonishing comments about the situation came from senior Hamas official Mousa Abu-Marzook. When asked by a foreign reporter why Hamas didn't use its extensive tunnel infrastructure to protect the Palestinian civilians from the Israeli attack, he responded , \"Protecting Gaza civilians is the responsibility of the United Nations and Israel.... We have built the tunnels to protect ourselves from getting targeted and killed.\"\n\nWe also know-according to the polls by Dr. Khalil Shikaki , director of the highly respected Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah-that over 70 percent of Palestinians believe that the Hamas attack on October 7 was correct. However, that doesn't mean that 70 percent believe in Hamas's Islamic ideology. That support exists because the attack placed the Palestinian issue back on the agenda after it had been ignored for so long by the Israelis and the international community, and it delivered a blow to Israeli hubris. That same majority also denies that Hamas committed the clearly documented atrocities against Israeli civilians, men, women, and children on October 7. And yet, according to the latest March poll by PCPSR, support for Hamas as a political party has fallen to 34 percent among Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, a 12-point drop from December 2023. And courageous Haaretz journalist Amira Hass, the only Israeli journalist who has actually lived in Gaza for a period and who is constantly branded a traitor by Israeli rightists, wrote an April 1 article based on conversations with her contacts about how Gazans hate the local Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar for bringing all this death and destruction upon them.\n\nNone of what I have written above is meant to justify Israel's response to the October 7 attack, carried out by the most extreme government in the country's history.\n\nThere is no doubt that the messianic religious fundamentalists represented by Finance Minister Betzalel Smotrich and his National Religious Party, and the racist followers of Rabbi Meir Kahane-National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and his Jewish Power Party-are Jewish fundamentalist mirror images of the Palestinian religious fundamentalist Hamas in Israel. Smotrich's 2017 \" Decisive Plan \" is the Israeli version of the exclusivist Hamas approach to the future of Israel/Palestine. Many Knesset members of Netanyahu's Likud party also have the same approach.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nFeature / Jess McAllen\n\nAll Israelis went into a collective state of shock on October 7-the worst, most deadly day in Israeli history since the establishment of the state in 1948: over 1,200 people killed, over 2,500 wounded, 251 hostages, southern kibbutzim and towns overrun for a few days, and over 150,000 people displaced from their homes.\n\nIt was clear that Israel was going to respond militarily. The army had to make up for its intelligence and strategic failure on October 7. And the government, which had a total systems collapse in the first few days while all support for the families affected by the attack was provided by civil society, felt it had to order a retaliatory strike against Hamas to reassert Israel's deterrent capacity. Many Israelis were also feeling a primordial rage for revenge after the atrocities that were committed that day.\n\nHowever, as the campaign has entered its sixth month, it is clear that this is not just another typical Hamas-Israel round of fighting. The devastation in Gaza is immense, and by March at least 32,000 Gazans have been killed-the majority being civilians, men, women and children, with at least two-thirds of the 2.3 million population displaced from their homes. Much of international public opinion is understandably aghast at the level of death and destruction, while most Israelis haven't even seen it since-with the honorable exception of Haaretz -the mainstream electronic and print media in Israel have been focusing on our pain, stories about those who died on October 7, the 100-plus remaining hostages and their families, the Israelis displaced from their homes in the south and north, and young soldiers who are dying almost every day.\n\nAnd it is clear that both Hamas on October 7, and Israel since the beginning of its massive military response, have committed war crimes.\n\nNow, the challenge is to end the fighting as soon as possible, to find a way to release the remaining Israeli hostages who are still alive, and to begin the process of rebuilding Gaza. The Arab countries, the European Union, and the American government have all said that they are not ready to invest in rebuilding until there is path to an end to the conflict. That requires a clear path to an end to the occupation and the creation of a two-state solution, a Palestinian state based on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip with East Jerusalem as its capital, alongside the State of Israel. That is still possible, with the addition of a 4-5 percent land swap which would include 80 percent of the settlers within the sovereign state of Israel, neutralizing them as a problem.\n\nHowever, any notion of a possible Israeli readiness for a one-state solution is a pipe dream. Both Israeli and Palestinian society are living in a state of tremendous trauma, filled with anger at the other. If the Czechs and Slovaks, the Indians and Pakistanis, and all the components of former Yugoslavia couldn't stay together in one state, how can anyone seriously imagine a one-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians in any foreseeable future?\n\nPalestinians justifiably want an end to the occupation and an independent life of their own. The grass roots also aspire to Palestinian unity between Fatah and Hamas. This would require that Hamas join the PLO. The Fatah leaders say that their condition for that is that Hamas has to accept the 1993 Declarations of Principles (the Oslo Accords) between the PLO and the Israeli government, which is based on mutual recognition. Unless Hamas changes its ideology and accepts the idea of the existence of the State of Israel alongside the future Palestinian state, it cannot be a partner to a two-state solution-the only solution that can provide both Palestinians and Israelis with the possibility of a dignified and secure life.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

Activate your online access\n\nAn interview with political philosopher Susan Neiman, the author of Left Is Not \"Woke.\"\n\nSusan Neiman is a prominent American political philosopher living in Berlin, where she directs the Einstein Forum. She is the author of many books, including Evil in Modern Thought and Learning From the Germans . Her most recent book, Left Is Not \"Woke , \" from Polity Press, has sparked an international conversation, with translations, she told me, coming out in languages from Thai to Farsi. This interview has been lightly edited and condensed.\n\nKatha Pollitt: What do you mean by \"woke\"? When Lead Belly urged Black people to \"stay woke\" in a 1938 song about the Scottsboro Boys, he meant \"Watch out for racism.\" To be woke was good. Now it's somewhere between a joke and a pejorative: Ron DeSantis named his law against teaching about racism the Stop Woke Act .\n\nSusan Neiman: Many people urged me not to use this title, for fear that it would be seen as supporting the right. But I decided to use it because it's a phenomenon people recognize all over the world. The term is confusing because it is based on traditional left-wing emotions, like wanting to stand up for the oppressed, while relying on assumptions that are drawn from the right-like a commitment to tribalism rather than universalism and a focus on power rather than justice. Because many leftists are increasingly uneasy with those assumptions, they are uncertain about what it means to be left today. I wrote the book to set out simple philosophical principles that define what \"left\" is-because people recognize what \"woke\" is, even if they have trouble defining it.\n\nKP: What is \"left\"? You criticize \"progressives\" for what you see as an excessive focus on victimhood and identity politics, in which people are lumped together according to race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and so on, with massive assumptions made about what they want and need. You want universalist values. But isn't a major feature of today's left that people are demanding the right to speak up for themselves about their own issues and problems?\n\nSN: Traditionally, the left was concerned with universal justice, which included the right to speak up about each group's own problems but was never confined to it. Thanks to a combination of ideologies that took hold at the end of the 20th century, including neoliberalism and evolutionary psychology, we have come to normalize the idea that self-interest is the only thing that motivates us to action. That's actually a right-wing philosophical assumption.\n\nKP: You support universalism over what you call tribalism, but where does that leave women and minorities? Universal programs, such as national health insurance, are important and help everybody, but it takes a lot more to give disadvantaged people equal access to good care. Countries that have universal programs, like the United Kingdom , still have big problems with racism and sexism in medical care. Doesn't universalism use white men as the (unconscious) norm?\n\nSN: Like other good ideas, universalism can be abused, and politicians have indeed often preached universalism while-more or less unconsciously-practicing tribalism that serves the interests of white men. But the only real basis for arguing against racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination is the universalist question \"Is she not also a human being?\" Here I'm quoting the Ghanaian philosopher Ato Sekyi-Otu, whose book Left Universalism convincingly argues that universalism is not a European invention but an ideal found in his native Akan as much as anywhere else. The point is that we can only fight oppression by appeals to universal values. Otherwise the struggles have nothing to do with justice but are just a matter of tribes fighting for power.\n\nKP: How is tribalism different from people with common problems uniting as an interest group?\n\nSN: It isn't different. The question is whether the best thing we can do is to unite as interest groups or allies, as the US and the USSR did as long as they were fighting the Nazis-or can we return to the idea of international solidarity, which once defined the left? That distinguished it from the right, which recognized no deep connections and few obligations to those outside a particular tribe. We've become used to the idea that people only act upon their own self-interest, but it often is not the case. One of my heroes, Paul Robeson, was the son of an enslaved man . He was subject to racist abuse much of his life. Yet what sparked his own turn to political activism was an encounter with striking Welsh miners.\n\nKP: All over the world, reactionary forces are gaining strength in places as disparate as India, Texas, and France. In Germany, where you've lived for many years, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) is moving ahead despite scandals over its Nazi sympathies. Why is this happening?\n\nSN: Reactionary forces are indeed gaining strength, because tribalism is the easiest way of reacting to global neoliberalism. To focus on Germany for brevity: The AfD and a left-wing party with some similarities have argued that the current center-left government has substituted symbolism for policies that would increase genuine equality. Gender-­sensitive language does not change the fact that women earn 18 percent less than men, on average, or cannot pay their rent where housing is no longer considered a social right, as it was in East Germany. But it's always easier to blame immigration than to imagine creating systemic change.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

You Need One Another.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nIn the Democratic civil war, both sides are partly right.\n\nBy Michelle Goldberg\n\nOpinion Columnist\n\nIn 2004, I went to Ohio to cover John Kerry's campaign to unseat George W. Bush. For liberals, the race felt existential. The Bush administration had lied America into war in Iraq, where an entirely predictable insurgency was raging. His military and C.I.A. were torturing people; the Abu Ghraib scandal had broken open in April.\n\nA worshipful cult of personality surrounded the president, whose administration was nakedly disdainful of truth. Yet four years earlier Bush had lost the popular vote, in a race where progressives were divided and a decisive number voted third party. Surely, it seemed, with the right mobilization Democrats should be able to defeat him this time.\n\nLiberal groups launched what Matt Bai described in The New York Times Magazine as \"the largest get-out-the-vote effort ever undertaken to win a single presidential campaign.\" It wasn't enough. Democrats did increase their turnout, but Republicans increased theirs even more.\n\nReporting from Ohio megachurches and right-wing rallies, I could see that many conservatives were motivated by the specter of gay marriage, which had been recognized in Massachusetts a few months earlier. In the election, 11 states including Ohio - including Oregon - passed ballot initiatives against same-sex marriage. Postelection surveys showed that \"moral values\" beat out issues like Iraq and the economy as voters' chief concern.\n\nAs I look back from 2020, two things seem obvious to me. L.G.B.T.Q. activists had justice on their side, even if the campaign for marriage equality caused a terrifying backlash before it triumphed. At the same time, it's understandable why Democratic politicians like Barack Obama publicly opposed same-sex marriage in 2008, since to do otherwise risked producing permanent right-wing rule. Good policy and good politics are not the same thing.\n\nThe 2004 election illuminates some of the dilemmas faced by today's Democrats, who are currently locked in an internecine battle between progressives and moderates. It's a frustrating and destructive fight because both sides are partly right.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

But the region's new leaders face serious economic constraints and legislative opposition that could restrict their ambitions, and restive voters who have been willing to punish whoever fails to deliver.\n\nThe left's gains could buoy China and undermine the United States as they compete for regional influence, analysts say, with a new crop of Latin American leaders who are desperate for economic development and more open to Beijing's global strategy of offering loans and infrastructure investment . The change could also make it harder for the United States to continue isolating authoritarian leftist regimes in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba.\n\nWith rising inflation and stagnant economies, Latin America's new leaders will find it hard to deliver real change on profound problems, said Pedro Mendes Loureiro, a professor of Latin American studies at the University of Cambridge.

Building those alliances \"is relatively easy to achieve,\" said the party's president, Mario Delgado, in an interview.\n\n\"We are now a dominant force,\" Mr. Delgado added, \"by the decision of the people.\"\n\nThe final makeup of the legislature is still unclear because a share of seats in the Mexican Congress are appointed via a system of proportional representation in August. Legal challenges could also affect how seats are allocated.\n\nBut Morena has come close enough to total dominance to prompt a strong reaction from a sector that the party can't ignore: the financial markets.\n\nIn the volatile days following the election, investors' alarm has been on full display, with Mexican stocks battered and the peso suffering its worst week since the pandemic.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "What's Driving Former Progressives to the Right?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nMichelle Goldberg\n\nBy Michelle Goldberg\n\nOpinion Columnist\n\nIn a new essay in the progressive magazine In These Times, the writers Kathryn Joyce and Jeff Sharlet grapple with the contemporary version of an old phenomenon: erstwhile leftists decamping to the right. There have been plenty of high-profile defectors from the left in recent years, among them the comedian Russell Brand, the environmentalist-turned-conspiracy-theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and the journalist Matt Taibbi, a onetime scourge of Wall Street, who was recently one of the winners of a $100,000 prize from the ultraconservative Young America's Foundation.\n\nWhat gives this migration political significance, however, are the ordinary people following them, casting off what they view as a censorious liberalism for a movement that doesn't ask anyone to \" do the work \" or \"check your privilege.\" Joyce and Sharlet write, \"We, the authors of this article, each count such losses in our own lives, and maybe you do, too: friends you struggle to hold onto despite their growing allegiance to terrifying ideas, and friends you give up on, and friends who have given up on you and the hope you shared together.\"\n\nNaomi Klein described similar losses in her great book \"Doppelganger,\" which follows the exploits of one of the most infamous of recent progressive apostates, Naomi Wolf, a former liberal feminist who became an anti-vax influencer and a regular on Steve Bannon's podcast. \"Almost everyone I talk to tells me about people they have lost 'down the rabbit hole' - parents, siblings, best friends, as well as formerly trusted intellectuals and commentators,\" wrote Klein. \"People, once familiar, who have become unrecognizable.\"\n\nA key question for the left is why this is happening. For some celebrity defectors, the impetus seems clear enough: They lurched right after a cancellation or public humiliation. Klein writes that a turning point for Wolf was widespread mockery after she was confronted, live on the radio, with evidence that the thesis of the book she was promoting was based on her misreading of archival documents. Brand's right-wing turn, as Matt Flegenheimer wrote in The New York Times Magazine, coincided with the start of investigations into sexual-assault accusations against him. But that doesn't explain why there's such an eager audience for born-again reactionaries and why, in much of the Western world, the right has been so much better than the left at harnessing hatred of the status quo.\n\nPart of the answer is probably that the culture of the left is simply less welcoming, especially to the politically unsure, than the right. The conservative movement may revel in cruelty toward out-groups - see, for example, the ravening digital mobs that descended on the podcaster Julia Mazur for a TikTok she made about the pleasures of life without children - but the movement is often good at love-bombing potential recruits. \"People go where people accept them, or are nice to them, and away from people who are mean to them,\" the Marxist Edwin Aponte, one of the founders of the heterodox but socially conservative magazine Compact, told Joyce and Sharlet.\n\nBut I think there's a deeper problem, which stems from a crisis of faith in the possibility of progress. Liberals and leftists have lots of excellent policy ideas but rarely articulate a plausible vision of the future. I sometimes hear leftists talk about \"our collective liberation,\" but outside a few specific contexts - the ongoing subjugation of the Palestinians comes to mind - I mostly have no idea what they're talking about.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "THE AMERICAN LEFT STILL SEARCHES FOR A CLEAR POLITICAL DIRECTION\n\nTrump Administration\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nIS there a future for left-wing politics in this country? The old leftist parties of the first half of the century seem moribund, and the 1960's, for all their tumult, did not give birth to new ones. Among leftists now there is a growing debate about what to do. It is a debate confused by the decline of the liberal wings of the two major parties to which leftists in the past have looked for support.\n\nAll this comes at a time when six people, including members of the radical left splinter group, the Weather Underground, are awaiting trial in Rockland County on murder charges stemming from an October 1981 robbery of a Brink's truck in which two policemen and a guard were killed. Last week, in the second week of pretrial proceedings, the continuing political theater was reminiscent of trials of other left wing activists in the 1960's. Four of the defendants declared themselves ''prisoners of war'' and refused to participate in their defense. One defense lawyer said the trial was illegal, another argued for the defendants' right to wear tee shirts bearing political slogans and the judge barred several attorneys from leaving the courtroom as their clients shouted ''Long live Palestine.''\n\nFew students of politics would argue that there is any but a factitious connection between the holdup and killings and the tradition of the left in this country, but many worry about the popular impression the publicity surrounding the trial will leave.\n\nD.J.R.Bruckner, an editor of The New York Times Book Review, interviewed six people - writers, activists, teachers - four of them most often identified as leftist thinkers and two as conservative. They are Eugene Genovese, professor of history at the University of Rochester; Elinor Langer, author of ''Notes For Next Time: A Memoir of the 60's'' which appeared in Working Papers in 1973 and who is a columnist for Mother Jones, a member of the editorial board of The Nation and a fellow at the Bunting Institute of Radcliffe College; Nathan Glazer, professor of education and sociology at Harvard and co-editor of The Public Interest who this year is teaching in France; Sheldon S. Wolin, professor of political theory at Princeton University and editor of the journal ''democracy''; Heather Booth, president of the Midwest Academy, a center for training leaders of citizens groups and organizations centered on community issues, director of the State and Local Leadership Project, past director of the Citizens/Labor Energy Coalition; and Theodore J. Lowi, who is John L. Senior Professor of American Institutions at Cornell University. Excerpts from the interviews follow.\n\nQuestion. What message does the Brink's robbery give people about the left-wing movement of the 1960's?\n\nAnswer. There was a frustration within the youth movement which drove a very small number of people into almost nihilistic violence. And some of those people have resurfaced. This is nothing new in the world and we're talking about a very few people. I don't see any point in trying to understand the political phenomena of the 60's from that angle.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

But the region's new leaders face serious economic constraints and legislative opposition that could restrict their ambitions, and restive voters who have been willing to punish whoever fails to deliver.\n\nThe left's gains could buoy China and undermine the United States as they compete for regional influence, analysts say, with a new crop of Latin American leaders who are desperate for economic development and more open to Beijing's global strategy of offering loans and infrastructure investment . The change could also make it harder for the United States to continue isolating authoritarian leftist regimes in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba.\n\nWith rising inflation and stagnant economies, Latin America's new leaders will find it hard to deliver real change on profound problems, said Pedro Mendes Loureiro, a professor of Latin American studies at the University of Cambridge.

But it is increasingly evident that the governing party is ex periencing serious divisions.\n\nAn intense debate on infla tion, long discussed privately, came to the surface in Parlia ment two weeks ago when it was suggested that the Govern ment was collecting irrelevant figures to prove that Singapore experienced only a 1 per cent rise in the cost of living annual ly over the last decade. There also is mounting dissatisfaction over rising \"nominal charges\" for social welfare services.\n\nEssentially, some of the Prime Minister's critics say he has abandoned the social welfare aspects of his socialism and turned to the training of techno crats who will serve foreign industrial investors. Lower in come groups believe they are suffering from a cost‐of‐living squeeze.\n\nThe new party is critical of foreign investment, particularly American and British, which it says has become too dominant here.\n\nThe party already has picked up a rather important defector from Mr. Lee's party. Present at last week's news conference was Leong Mun Kwai, author of a Chinese‐language novel, \"Death and Protest,\" which presents a lightly veiled attack on the governing party. Mr. Leong resigned from the People's Action party last week, after seven years of member ship.\n\nMr. Lul, the People's Front secretary general, has a strong labor union background. He is described by David Marshall, former Chief Minister of Sing apore, as a tough, honest, self made man. Mr. Lui has pre sented a party manifesto calling for eventual reunification of Singapore with Malaya, which it Joined briefly in a fed eration.\n\nThe manifesto also calls for changing the Employment Act, which increased working hours without an increase in pay, and the Internal Security Act, which permits detention without trial of political prisoners considered a danger to the state.\n\nAdvertisement"

Markham Special to the New York Times\n\nVIENTIANE, Laos April 7-In the last few days, Laos, which has embarked on her third attempt at a coalition government in less than two decades, has been basking in a happy mood of homecoming and national reconciliation. Prince Souphanouvong, the tiitular Pathet Lao leader, returned to the capital after 11 years of sef‐imposed exile in the rugged hills of eastern Laos; he and his half‐brother, Prince Souvanna Phouma, emotionally reunited, traveled to Luang Prabang, the royal capital, where the King invested them as the pivotol figures of the new political arrangement; and then leftists, neutralists and rightists, attired in traditional sarongs and highbuttoned tunics, took their oaths of allegiance at Vientiane's most sacred pagoda.\n\nNews Analysis\n\nPrince Souvanna Phouma, the indispensable neutralist Premier has always argued that the Pathet Lao was more Laotian than Communist. Once weaned from the influence of their North Vietnamese patrons, he has contended, the leaders would drift back into their more natural position as true Laotian nationalists.\n\nSeeing the supposedly Communist Pathet Lao leaders going through the almost feudal royal and religious ceremonies of the last few days has tended to lend credence to the Premier's arguments.\n\nBut it can also be argued that the Pathet Lao leaders have nothing to lose, and much to gain, by performing reassuringly before Laos and the outside world.\n\nSteady Gains for Pathet Lao\n\nThey can afford to behave generously. Two decades of intermittent war have seen a steady gain in their influence throughout the country, and now they and their soldiers are legally installed in the heartland of their long‐standing foes.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the Cabinet members from the Vientiane side will be vigorous and resourceful enough to, insist on adherence to the provisions of the peace agreements giving them access to the territory controlled by the Pathet Lao, which amounts to four‐fifths of all Laos.\n\nBut in the, meantime, it is likely that working level Pathet Lao political officials will try to make inroads-as they al ready have in Luang Prabanginto the sympathies of the two‐thirds of Laos's population that was nominally under the control of the former Vientiane Government.\n\nIn the eyes of informed Laotians, the most telltale clue to future Pathet Lao behavior was the decision to place the energetic Prince Souphanouvong at the head of the National Political Council, a potentially powerful advisory body that Vientiane rightists long ago dubbed the \"politburo.\"\n\nThe 42‐member council, which is officially \"independent of\" and \"equal to\" the Cabinet, has rather extensive powers in the organization of the elections that are expected ultimately to provide the basis, fore a new, representative Cabinet. The Pathet Lao side, which has done well in past elections, is expected to put its long‐range hopes into winning over the people, which is also the professed intention of the less‐organized rightist and non‐Communist politicians.\n\nThe council, in which the Pathet. Lao has a slight organization edge, will provide the 62‐year‐old Prince Souphanouvong with a sounding board for his views-and an excuse to travel around the country.\n\nThe Prince, who in the last few days has displayed what for low‐keyed Laos is a charismatic streak, is expected to base himself at Luang Prabang, putting a distinct distance between himself rand the rest of the Government. Having no governmental responsibilities, he will be able to dissociate himself from the coalition Cabinet if it becomes politically paralyzed or unable to improve the lives of ordinary Laotians.\n\nWhile the Pathet Lao has not filled its allotted Cabinet positions with nonentities, it appears quite clear that key revolutionaries have remained out of the Cabinet-and out of the political council as well.\n\nThough by far the best known and in a position of great leverage, Prince Souphanouvong is not thought to be the most powerful leader of the Neo Lao Hak Xat or. Lao Patriotic Front, the name by which the Pathet Lao is properly known.\n\n\"Hard\" leaders of the Laotian revolutionary movement -men like Xaysone Phomvihan-are still in Sam Neua, the unofficial Pathet Lao capital in northeastern Laos, or in Hanoi, running the semisecret People's party of Laos, which in turn controls the Neo Lao Hak Xat. Whatever decisions these men make will not necessarily be tempered by the mood of harmony and goodwill that has been evident in Vientiane in the last few days.\n\nBoth Sides Face Problems\n\nIn the short run, both sides will have their hands full just trying to take control of their respective ministries as well as trying to turn the political council into a political reality.\n\nSome Laotians from the Vientiane side are pessimistic about the chances of making the clumsy coalition process work-all important decisions must be \"unanimous,\" for example-but others argue that Laos being Laos, the Government will muddle on through.\n\nAgain, in the short run, few people expect the new Government to make any dramatic policy, decisions. As one wellplaced diplomat put it, Laos is in a \"field of gravity\"-North Vietnam, the United States, Thailand, China and the Soviet Union all have claims on the little kingdom that should keep her from lurching in any particular geopolitical direction.\n\nOne interesting straw in the wind is that the Pathet Lao has reportedly indicated that it will welcome continued United States financial assistance to the Government, which would be broke without it.\n\nTwice in the last two decades Laotian, coalition governments foundered and Collapsed largely because of cold war tensions and the spillover of the Vietnam, war. Today the great powers, North Vietnam and perhaps even Thailand welcome this fresh start ?? tion.\n\nIn addition to a more salutary international climate, Laos still has the hardy 72‐year‐old Prince Souvanna Phounma, a veteran of the past coalitions and a vital mediating presence between the Pathet Lao and its rightist opponents.\n\nAccording to diplomats the bluff Premier remains in good health. If this is so it augurs well for the early months of the new Government. Without him, it is generally agreed, Laos would not have been able to come as far as she has-the only country in Indochina beginning to, be at peace with itself.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Turned Around\n\nThe biggest story of the past fifty years in American politics has been the ascendancy of the right, and it's a story of apostasy. At each stage of the conservative movement's long march to power, crucial aid was provided by heretics from the left. Progressives recoiled from the New Deal and turned reactionary; ex-Communists helped to launch National Review, in the nineteen-fifties; recovering socialists founded neoconservatism in the sixties and seventies; New Left radicals turned on their former comrades and former selves in the Reagan years. Ronald Reagan, whose Presidency brought the movement to its high-water mark, was himself once a New Deal liberal. In the course of a lifetime, the prevailing political winds are westerly-they blow from left to right. Try to think of public figures who made the opposite journey: Elizabeth Warren, Garry Wills, and Joan Didion come to mind, and Kevin Phillips, the disillusioned Nixon strategist; more recently, the writer Michael Lind and the Clinton-hater-turned-lover David Brock defected from the right to the left. That's about it.\n\nThe most common explanation is the one variously attributed to Churchill, Clemenceau, and Lloyd George: \"Any man who is not a socialist at age twenty has no heart. Any man who is still a socialist at age forty has no head.\" The move rightward is thus a sign of the hard wisdom that comes with age and experience-or, perhaps, the callousness and curdled dreams that accompany stability and success. Irving Kristol, the ex-Trotskyist who became the godfather of neoconservatism, quipped that a neoconservative was \"a liberal who has been mugged by reality.\" Most people are hardly aware of the shift until it's exposed by a crisis, like a major political realignment that forces us to cross party lines. Even then, they want to believe that it's the politics, not themselves, that changed. My maternal grandfather, George Huddleston, an Alabama congressman in the early decades of the twentieth century, began his career voting with the only Socialist in Congress and ended as a bitter opponent of what he saw as the federal overreach of the New Deal. In 1935, on the floor of the House, a Democratic colleague mocked him for reversing his position on public ownership of electric power. Fuming, Huddleston insisted, \"My principles and myself remain unchanged-it is the definition of 'liberalism' which has been changed.\" Or, as Reagan famously (and falsely) claimed, he didn't leave the Democratic Party-the Democratic Party left him.\n\nIt's like blaming your spouse for your own unfaithfulness. Political conversions are painful affairs, as hard to face up to as falling out of love or losing your religion. Or maybe harder. Religious faith, being beyond the reach of reason, doesn't have to answer gotcha questions about a previously held position. There's a special contempt reserved for the political apostate-an accusation of intellectual collapse, an odor of betrayal. When you switch sides, you have to find new friends. Political identities are shaped mainly by factors that have nothing to do with rational deliberation: family and tribal origins, character traits, historical currents. In \"Partisan Hearts and Minds,\" published in 2002, three political scientists made an empirical case that political affiliations form in early adulthood and seldom change. Few people can be reasoned into abandoning their politics.\n\nIn the twentieth century, the void left by the loss of religion was sometimes filled by totalizing political systems, and the result was a literary genre of confession that is as powerful and probing as the Augustinian kind. \"The God That Failed,\" published in 1950, compiled personal narratives by six former Communists and fellow-travellers, including André Gide, Arthur Koestler, Ignazio Silone, and Richard Wright. Each one told a tale of coming of age in a world riven with crisis, finding meaning in Marxism, identity in the Party, and inspiration in the Soviet Union, gradually growing disillusioned, and finally breaking with Communism. In some cases, it was an experience akin to watching a former self die. It was nearly impossible for these writers to discover a new faith, political or religious, to replace Communism and its power to erase the sense of insignificance that awaits any sentient person.\n\nTwo years later, in 1952, came \"Witness,\" by the century's most tormented ex-Communist, Whittaker Chambers. Daniel Oppenheimer's sequence of biographical essays about six left-wing defectors, \"Exit Right: The People Who Left the Left and Reshaped the American Century\" (Simon & Schuster), begins with Chambers. This is Oppenheimer's first book, but he writes with the assurance and historical command of someone who has been thinking about his topic for a long time. The colors of his own flag are hard to discern, which makes him a reliable guide. His sympathy goes to the candidly conflicted, the nakedly shattered. He wants to know why people come to hold the political beliefs they do. Stories of apostasy, he writes, \"are worth telling because it's during the period of political transition, when the bones of one's belief system are broken and poking out through the skin, that the contingency and complexity of belief become most visible.\" This quest is particularly relevant at a time when Americans are dug deep into two opposing trenches, and crossing no man's land is a great way to get picked off.\n\nOppenheimer never quite answers his central question: \"Exit Right\" is more history than political theory and psychology. Its mini-biographies provide the author with enough thread to weave the larger story of the American left in the twentieth century, from the Daily Worker to the Hitler-Stalin Pact, from the House Un-American Activities Committee to \"The Fire Next Time,\" from Partisan Review to Ramparts , from Vietnam to 9/11. In addition to Chambers, there's James Burnham, a Trotskyist philosopher of the nineteen-thirties who became a founding editor of National Review; Ronald Reagan, who started out closer to the mainstream than any of the others; Norman Podhoretz, who, in the sixties, took Commentary first leftward and then rightward with him; David Horowitz, the son of Communist Party members and a radical friend of the Black Panthers, until their violence sent him fleeing to Reaganism; and Christopher Hitchens, who belongs in another category, having never been an orthodox leftist and having never really fit with the new conservative friends of his final decade.\n\nAmong the six characters, there's no recurring type, only a hectic impulse toward self-revision that is captured in a line from Clifford Odets's play \"Paradise Lost\": \"We cancel our experience. This is an American habit.\" But each tale of defection reveals a personal temper that makes these men passionately hostile to the politics of pluralism. They embrace new truths with the convert's fervor and certitude-Oppenheimer's \"contingency and complexity of belief\" is not for them. What they loathe most is liberalism.\n\nChambers's tale is one of suffering and high drama out of Dostoyevsky. \"Life is pain,\" he wrote to his children in the letter that prefaces \"Witness,\" and \"each of us hangs always upon the cross of himself.\" For Chambers, politics was religious, a continual struggle between good and evil, and the only form of political commitment was absolute. His story has already been told extremely well twice-first in the morbid exaltations of \"Witness,\" then in Sam Tanenhaus's magisterial biography, from 1997, both essential sources for Oppenheimer. Chambers was born in 1901 and grew up on Long Island, in a middle-class family whose chaos and decay gave the boy intimations of a wider illness in the modern world. His father, a half-closeted homosexual, was cruel to Whittaker; his mother was a loving but deeply neurotic woman; his brother was a future suicide. The Chambers house fell into disrepair, along with Whittaker's teeth. Oppenheimer devotes a lot of space to Chambers's early years, because they explain his flight into the encompassing arms of the Communist Party, in 1925. \"It offered me what nothing else in the dying world had power to offer at the same intensity,\" he wrote in \"Witness\"-\"faith and a vision, something for which to live and something for which to die.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nIn 1932, Chambers became an agent of the Communist underground, and within a few years he was serving as a courier between a cell of officials in the Roosevelt Administration and their coarse, brutal Soviet handler, Boris Bykov, who could have come from Koestler's \"Darkness at Noon.\" While passing along microfilmed government secrets to the Soviets, Chambers, married and a father, was able to indulge his attraction to men. Cruising followed some of the same patterns as spying: \"A large part of his job was to move in the shadows, to exchange meaningful glances with strangers, to take midnight ambles punctuated with intervals of purposeful loitering.\"\n\nThere was no single reason that Chambers ceased to be a Communist. In \"Witness,\" he says the break began when his daughter was eating porridge in her high chair, and he came to the realization that she-and, more specifically, her ear-had been created by some design. But he stayed in the Party for years after feeling the finger of God on his forehead. Around 1936, news of the Moscow purge trials of leading Bolsheviks began to make its way to those in America willing to hear-and Chambers didn't close his mind to the terrible truth. (Millions of people perished in what came to be called the Great Terror.) There was also \"the accumulated tedium of years of underground work, and how little there was to show for it,\" Oppenheimer writes. \"There were the sappingly antisocial patterns of underground life, all the dislocations and secrecy and lying.\" In \"Witness,\" though, Chambers describes his reason in the simplest terms: \"This is evil, absolute evil. Of this evil I am a part.\"\n\nThe metaphysical strain is what makes Chambers different from most of the millions of other Communist believers who wasted their years and corrupted themselves before losing their faith, and what makes \"Witness\" a successor to Augustine's \"Confessions\" and Bunyan's \"Pilgrim's Progress.\" The autobiography has little to say about dialectical materialism, social fascism, or the Popular Front. After reading \"Witness,\" the critic Harold Rosenberg said, \"This man is not interested in politics.\" When Chambers let his friend Alger Hiss, a State Department official and fellow-spy, know that he was on his way out, he tried to persuade him to leave, too. But Hiss was a bureaucrat, not a soul in Hell, and he brushed Chambers off: \"What you have been saying is just mental masturbation.\"\n\nChambers's break with the Party put his and his family's life in jeopardy, and it plunged him into an inevitable spiritual crisis. He couldn't bear to live without a purpose. He began to pray to the Being who had created his daughter's ear; he became a Christian. \"In God,\" Oppenheimer writes, \"he'd found a replacement vision that seemed deep enough to sustain him emotionally and rich enough, in its explanatory power, to provide answers to the questions about modern life that still haunted him.\" Oppenheimer leaves the story there. He doesn't describe Chambers's subsequent career as Henry Luce's star writer at Time , or his sudden fame (and infamy) when, in 1948, Representative Richard Nixon put him under the lights and elicited his testimony against Hiss (who denied everything, then and for the rest of his long life). The Hiss-Chambers faceoff in Congress and the courts divided Americans; in a way, it was the opening battle in the culture wars of the past half century. Perhaps Oppenheimer felt that this dénouement was already familiar, or superfluous to his main concern.\n\nBut Chambers didn't become just an anti-Communist. In substituting God for Stalin, he pointed his sword at what he called \"man's second oldest faith.\" He went on, \"Its promise was whispered in the first days of the Creation under the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil: 'Ye shall be as gods.' It is the great alternative faith of mankind.\" Chambers was a Manichaean, and to him the Hiss case was a conflict between God and Man without God. The enemy wasn't merely Communism-it was \"those who believe in the primacy of secular Man.\" This is why, when he became a heretic, in 1938, Chambers didn't turn to New Deal liberalism. Disillusionment with the liberal values of skepticism, tolerance, and reason had driven him to Communism in 1925, and the same aversion made him a high priest of the religious right. The worst thing was to be muddled. An old friend told Chambers, near the end of his life, \"You never changed, Whit, you just changed sides.\"\n\nOppenheimer's heretics aren't conservatives at all, in the spirit of Edmund Burke or Russell Kirk. Incremental progress isn't a strong enough drink-they need a perpetual showdown, a binary apocalypse. Along with their disdain for liberalism, there's a tendency to admire history's hard men. You sense it in the story of James Burnham, who passed through the inferno of the thirties unscathed, because, unlike Chambers, he lived it intellectually, not spiritually. Chambers replaced one zealous faith with another; Burnham-a nearly forgotten figure who dominated the scene while he was alive-kept changing systems. He was a well-off native of Chicago, a brilliant student at Princeton and Oxford, and then a philosophy professor at New York University. He became a Marxist after the crash of 1929, when he made the acquaintance of his departmental colleague Sidney Hook and read Trotsky's \"History of the Russian Revolution.\" A driving tour in the summer of 1933 through the Depression-stricken cities of the Midwest sealed the deal.\n\nAmerican Trotskyists led a couple of industrial strikes, but their main action was on paper and in meetings-essays and ripostes in The New International , factional fights, disputes over the proper definition of the Soviet Union (degenerated workers' state? bureaucratic collectivism?). When, toward the end of the thirties, famous comrades like Hook and the writer Max Eastman began to turn away from revolutionary Marxism and toward \"good old-fashioned liberalism and bourgeois moralism,\" Burnham set about dismantling their efforts with the full force of his systematic intellect. His scorn was all the more withering because he, too, was starting to question the truth of Marxist dialectics. \"I stopped arguing about religion long ago,\" he remarked to a comrade, and when the line got back to Trotsky, in his Mexican exile, the two men exchanged a series of increasingly ferocious essays and letters that couldn't conceal personal hurt.\n\nIn April, 1940, Burnham helped to form a splinter party of disillusioned Trotskyists, then immediately quit. \"To the degree that he still shared any strong convictions with the new party, they were almost exclusively negative convictions,\" Oppenheimer writes. \"The Soviet Union wasn't a workers' state anymore. The world war was an imperialist war, fought by all sides in the pursuit of profits and territories. The era of bourgeois liberalism was over.\" But Burnham had never given up his bourgeois trappings-the Princeton friends, the comfortable family life, the position at N.Y.U. \"There was a visible, plausible life for Burnham on the other side,\" Oppenheimer writes.\n\nOppenheimer leaves Burnham too soon as well, at the end of his Marxist years-stopping short of Trotsky's murder, in August of 1940, by an ice-pick-wielding agent of Stalin. We don't learn about the books and ideas for which Burnham became best known: \"The Managerial Revolution,\" published in 1941, which announced the rise of new totalitarian superstates, neither capitalist nor socialist but collectivist, controlled by a caste of \"managers\"; \"The Struggle for the World,\" a postwar tract that predicted and implicitly called for a third world war; and \"Suicide of the West,\" published in 1964. \"Liberalism,\" Burnham stated-meaning belief in reason-\"is the ideology of Western suicide.\" His predictions, consistently wrong, were always in effect the same one: democracy was doomed, and deservingly so, because it was too soft.\n\nLink copied\n\nIn 1983, President Reagan awarded Burnham-by then ailing and in his last years-the Medal of Freedom. In 1984, Chambers received it posthumously. Reagan claimed both men as major influences-he read and reread \"Witness\" until, Oppenheimer notes, \"its cadences were native to him, memorizing entire passages, quoting and paraphrasing them at length in political speeches\"-but their pessimism sat uneasily next to his sunny faith in the providential American future. Oppenheimer tells the familiar story of Reagan's youthful ardor for Roosevelt; his career as a Hollywood labor leader; his growing hostility to Communist infiltration of the unions; and his turn to the right when he became a pitchman for General Electric, began to associate with anti-Communists, and married Nancy Davis. Reagan ascribed his defection to \"the newfangled 'liberals' who rejected\" Roosevelt's faith in the wisdom of the American people, and who instead entrusted power to government engineers. It's a sentimental and ahistorical view. Roosevelt allowed Communists like Hiss to go on working for him even after being presented with Chambers's account of their perfidy, and he was more statist than the \"newfangled\" Democrats of the Eisenhower era.\n\nReagan needed to believe himself incapable of disloyalty to his father and to the President they both revered. Those attachments were part of the narrative of patriotism and virtue that remained constant throughout his life. \"He'd been a liberal because it was his inheritance,\" Oppenheimer writes. \"But the fit had never been completely comfortable. And as the reasons to keep bargaining with the old liberalism fell away, one by one, he began to accept that there was another mantle that might drape more comfortably.\"\n\nWithout anti-communism to give it shape and meaning, the quality of apostasy goes into decline in the course of the book. Podhoretz, born in the generation after Chambers, Burnham, and Reagan, is a conundrum-an irascible, narcissistic, \"ravenously ambitious\" writer and editor of considerable talent, but with nothing overwhelmingly urgent to say. In his mildly leftist younger years, the political question was: \"What did it all mean for him?\" In the nineteen-fifties, he sensed the country's restlessness because he felt it in himself; in the sixties, as the editor of Commentary , he embraced the new spirit. The decade's star writer, his friend Norman Mailer, was more talented and more free, and filled Podhoretz with excitement and competitive envy.\n\nThen, in 1967, he published a memoir called \"Making It,\" a confession and a celebration of his hunger for success. Podhoretz saw himself as the one intellectual willing to tell the truth about the importance of money and fame and social status to supposedly high-minded people, and in telling it he imagined that all of these would accrue to him in greater amounts. Instead, the book was reviled, and by the writers he most admired. \" 'Making It' generated an almost physiological cringe in its critics,\" Oppenheimer writes. The coup de grâce was delivered by Mailer himself, who, in Partisan Review, the holy grail of the New York intellectuals, called it \"a blunder of self-assertion, self-exposure, and self-denigration.\" (Literary moves that were safe only in the skilled hands of Norman Mailer.)\n\nPodhoretz went into a depression so black that it lasted two years. It ended one day in 1970, when, outside his summer farmhouse, Martini in hand, he had a vision, Chambers-like. At the depth of his crisis in trying to leave the Party, Chambers had heard a voice saying, \"If you will fight for freedom, all will be well with you\"-an intimation of divinity, to which he surrendered. Three decades later, Podhoretz looked up at the sky and, he later recalled, beheld \"a kind of diagram that resembled a family tree. And it was instantly clear to me that this diagram contained the secret of life and existence and knowledge: that you start with this, and you follow to that.\"\n\nThe diagram pointed Podhoretz away from radical freedom, toward the binding identities of religion and family and nationality. He had always argued for the legitimate claims of self-interest, ethnic and otherwise, and he itched to pop the more fragile bubbles of liberal idealism, as in his 1963 essay \"My Negro Problem-And Ours.\" Now he turned bitterly against the shibboleths of the left and began to tell himself a comforting story: that the brutal response to \"Making It\" was political. It revealed the hypocrisy of liberal intellectuals who wouldn't acknowledge the good their country had done them. As Oppenheimer puts it, with fine irony, \"Podhoretz began to reorganize his very self around the fight to win the war he hadn't been aware he was launching when he wrote Making It -in defense of America against the barbarians of the Left.\"\n\nBy one standard, Podhoretz emerged victorious from the sixties: leftism rapidly burned out, while his neoconservatism fed magazines and think tanks and White Houses for the next generation. He kept insisting, though never convincingly, that he was glad to be rid of his old friends; he became a dogmatic sourpuss and ended up a fan of Sarah Palin. It's hard to imagine Chambers landing there, but then politics had a different meaning for him.\n\nDavid Horowitz was an editor of Ramparts in the late sixties and the seventies-just the kind of cocky New Left radical, thundering against criminal Amerika, who drove older lefties like Podhoretz to neoconservatism. For Horowitz, the Moscow trials came in the form of the Black Panther Party's descent into criminal gangsterism. In late 1974, he asked a woman from Ramparts named Betty Van Patter to be a bookkeeper for a school run by the Panthers in Oakland. When her bludgeoned corpse washed up from San Francisco Bay, Horowitz concluded that the Panthers, and he, were responsible. In the ensuing years of self-recrimination, his Marxism died, though, like Chambers, he felt that his life might be at risk if he declared his defection too openly or too soon. The existential vision came in a Berkeley bookstore, amid shelf after shelf of titles: suddenly the Marxist ones, including his own, meant no more than any others. \"For the first time in my conscious life I was looking at myself in my human nakedness,\" he later wrote, \"without the support of revolutionary hopes, without the faith in a revolutionary future-without the sense of self-importance conferred by the role I would play in remaking the world. . . . I was nothing. \"\n\nHorowitz followed a path similar to Chambers's: both were total creatures of Marxist belief, who confronted brutal revelations about their comrades, abandoned the revolutionary movement, and were driven to crippling despair. After a lukewarm stopover in liberalism (he voted for Jimmy Carter in 1980), Horowitz defected to the Reagan-era right and became a provocateur, choosing race and campus politics as his battleground. There he met enough intolerance to keep his anger at the left and his former self perpetually stoked. But identity politics doesn't offer as worthy an enemy as the global Communist conspiracy. Chambers, Burnham, and Reagan became conservatives in response to an ideology they believed to be evil. Podhoretz and Horowitz were reacting against something more like stupidity.\n\nThe lives in \"Exit Right\" belong decidedly to the past. The denunciations and warnings from today's ex-leftists seem wildly exaggerated: the less real power the left has in American life, the more dire its image on the right grows. An anthology called \"Why I Turned Right,\" published in 2007, collected the latest generation's tales of heresy. It's a long way from \"The God That Failed\": most of the authors never got over their first encounters with those ruthless juggernauts of history, critical theory and campus feminism. Chambers thought he was defecting to the losing side, and even now conservatives feel like a beleaguered minority; meanwhile, the right has secured power in just about every American institution except the academy. Political correctness is, in part, a reaction to the defeat of the left's egalitarian dreams, the kind of mutation that occurs in isolation from the larger gene pool. If you can't overturn Citizens United, you can at least rename a university building.\n\nWe're due for a new crop of writers to start recording their disillusionment-this time with the right. The downward slide from Chambers and Reagan to Coulter and Trump has surely swept along a few young idealists who thought they were joining the side of freedom and truth, then realized too late that they had signed on for junk science and white identity politics. Ted Cruz's vision would require the toppling of just about every pillar of the country's social and economic structure. You don't have to look elsewhere for the destructive utopianism that turns believers into apostates. In a few years' time, we'll be reading the chilling inside story, written by a campaign aide who barely got out alive. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "A New Group of Leftist Primary Challengers Campaign Through Protests and the Coronavirus\n\nLate on the night of June 2nd, I encountered something I hadn't seen in quite some time: good news. Scrolling through Twitter, I noticed that Nikil Saval , an old friend and collaborator (and a New Yorker contributor) looked to be the likely winner of a long-shot primary campaign against the Democratic incumbent, Larry Farnese, for a Pennsylvania State Senate seat, though absentee ballots were still being counted. Shortly after Saval declared victory, almost two weeks later, the tally was 35,709 to 27,001. Saval didn't just beat Farnese; he demolished him.\n\nBefore I came across the news about Saval, my searches for updates from Philadelphia had surfaced far more disturbing results: riot cops assaulting Black Lives Matter protesters with rubber bullets and tear gas; an angry white mob armed with baseball bats patrolling the Fishtown neighborhood. I read a distressing first-person account of how difficult it was to cast a ballot in the primary: seventy per cent of polling places were closed, and vehicle traffic was prohibited, forcing voters to travel by foot or bicycle past the National Guard. I gasped at a series of photos of a bloodied young man who ventured out despite a head injury. \"If Joe can vote after the cops beat him, you can too,\" the tweeter enjoined.\n\nSaval, who helped found Reclaim Philadelphia-a community group that has played a key role in supporting successful anti-establishment campaigns-is part of a national effort to transform the Democratic Party by pulling it to the left. Across the country, political novices, inspired by Bernie Sanders's Presidential bids and the rise of unapologetically left-wing candidates-most visibly, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez-have thrown their hats into the electoral ring. These campaigns tend to coalesce around a core set of policies: Medicare for All, cancelling student debt, free public college, criminal-justice reform, and a Green New Deal. It's not enough to win more power for Democrats, Jenifer Fernandez Ancona of Way to Win, a hub for progressive donors, told me. The goal is to win power within the Democratic Party.\n\nPrimary challengers face an uphill climb under normal circumstances. In 2016, only five incumbents in Congress-two Democrats and three Republicans-lost their seats, despite the fact that more than a third of Democrats and nearly half of Republicans faced challengers. But the insurgents campaigning this spring and summer have had the terrain shift dramatically under their feet. There is no map for running a primary campaign during a global pandemic, let alone a pandemic coupled with a historic wave of civil-rights protests. Connecting face-to-face is central to insurgent campaigns, but COVID -19 made door-knocking potentially lethal. Campaigns had to shift to phone calls and digital outreach, and they've had to educate potential supporters on not just whom to vote for but how to vote, after vote-by-mail rules changed almost overnight. Delayed primaries have caused additional confusion about when, exactly, elections are taking place and have also forced candidates to keep fund-raising beyond the expected finish line.\n\nSince March, experts have speculated that the pandemic would further tip the scales toward incumbents-that anxiety about the future might push voters toward familiar figures, and that incumbents' more abundant cash reserves would allow them to reach people sheltering at home with expensive advertising blitzes. The day after he formally declared victory, Saval told me he too initially assumed the worst. \"When we couldn't knock on doors, we had to be much more active and creative,\" Saval said. Meanwhile, his opponent failed to adapt. \"They just went on TV-they used mail. They didn't make phone calls or have people at the polls like we did.\" As a result, Saval's team mobilized a comparatively young, diverse group of voters. Something similar happened across Pennsylvania, where at least nine progressive candidates defeated more moderate Democratic opponents; Rick Krajewski, another Reclaim organizer, is likely heading to the state house with Saval after the general election in the fall. The same day, in New Mexico, five incumbent state senators were ousted by progressives in the Democratic primaries. Teresa Leger Fernandez, a local attorney and activist, won an outright victory in a seven-way primary for New Mexico's Third Congressional District, beating the former C.I.A. officer Valerie Plame and others.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., Janeese Lewis George, a thirty-two-year-old attorney and a democratic socialist, won a decisive upset against the incumbent D.C.-council member Brandon Todd, a former Republican. She secured critical union endorsements by talking directly to the rank and file, and strategically mobilized voters by having volunteers reach out to fellow Spanish speakers or neighbors contact people living nearby. As the weeks wore on and the coronavirus crisis deepened, her opponent's opposition to paid family leave, increasing wages for tipped workers, and demilitarizing the police seemed increasingly out of touch. In May, Democrats for Education Reform DC, which endorsed Todd, sent out a mailer attacking George's commitment to reallocating part of the police budget; little did it know that defunding the police would soon be a national rallying cry. \"Reality endorsed me at the right time,\" George reflected, clearly pleased.\n\nBy campaigning as Democrats, instead of running on a third-party ticket, candidates like George and Saval are reviving an old and largely forgotten tradition. A century ago, when primaries were introduced as a progressive reform to take power away from corrupt party bosses, insiders worried that radicals would use them to hijack the two main parties-and their fears were soon realized. In 1915, a former Socialist Party organizer named Arthur C. Townley founded the Nonpartisan League, in North Dakota, which connected poor rural farmers around economic grievances, overcoming differences in members' ethnicity and religion to build a powerful organization. Applying the group's experience with coöperative economics to the political realm, it demanded a state-owned bank and state-owned mill and elevator to stop exploitation by large agriculture firms. Using the primary system, the Nonpartisan League was able to capture the North Dakota Republican Party, and it briefly controlled the state government. The bank and mill it built are still in operation.\n\nA similar strategy is taking hold among some leftists today. Last year, the Chicago branch of the Democratic Socialists of America formally endorsed a group of five candidates for local government; they now control six of the city's fifty council seats. Inspired by that example, six primary candidates are now running as a D.S.A.-backed slate for a variety of state offices in New York. Their common platform includes support for single-payer health care, public housing and tenant protections, immigrant and worker rights, defunding the police, and a Green New Deal. They do joint fund-raisers and outreach to expand their collective influence. Jabari Brisport, a math teacher from Brooklyn who is running for an open State Senate seat as part of the slate, told me that the collaborative campaigning reflects socialist principles. \"It's about sharing resources,\" he said.\n\nBrisport told me that he knocked on seven hundred doors as part of Julia Salazar's successful campaign for the State Senate, in 2018, a tactic that is off the table during the pandemic. (In one of history's many strange echoes, the Nonpartisan League's success beyond North Dakota was hampered by the arrival of the 1918 Spanish flu, which led to a prohibition on public gatherings and made people reluctant to open their doors for campaigners.) In response, the D.S.A.-backed slate has shifted to a digital strategy, making calls and sending texts by the thousands and hosting events and fund-raisers. More significantly, all the candidates I spoke to have remade their campaigns to prioritize direct service and mutual aid. Samelys López, a longtime community activist whose organizing chops helped propel Ocasio-Cortez to Congress, is a slate candidate running for an open seat in New York's Fifteenth District, which is the poorest and most Democratic district in the country. \"In our wellness checks\"-calls that begin with asking how people are -\"what we are seeing is hunger,\" López told me. Sometimes López delivers food in the district, using meal delivery to connect neighbors so they can begin advocating for their rights. \"I feel like the people that live here in this community subsidize everyone's way of life in the city and outside of the city,\" López observed. They are the front-line workers keeping everyone else afloat and risking their lives just by doing their jobs. \"It seems to me that, especially during this time, we should compensate people for putting their lives on the line.\"\n\nLópez was homeless as a young person; she's lived in shelters and has had to depend on food banks. Her experiences, she believes, are part of what qualify her to hold office. Something similar could be said of Phara Souffrant Forrest, a thirty-one-year-old Haitian-American maternal-health field nurse, who is also running as part of D.S.A.'s slate. A lifelong resident of Crown Heights, in Brooklyn, and a longtime housing-justice activist, she is challenging the incumbent Walter Mosley for his seat in the State Assembly, running on a platform of tenants' rights, free universal health care, and police reform. Forrest's profession gives her an edge when it comes to making cold calls: these days, people are thrilled to learn that they have a nurse on the line. She's had people ask her about medications and what to expect when giving birth at the hospital during the pandemic. (Cori Bush, a nurse who is running a primary campaign for Congress in Missouri, also commented on the public's newfound respect for health-care workers: \"When I say I'm a nurse, it's like I said I was the Vice-President.\")\n\nNew York, which will hold its primary election on June 23rd, may well be the next state to see a wave of insurgents defeat Democratic incumbents. On Tuesday, June 2nd, at a community event focussed on police violence, the sixteen-term New York congressman Eliot Engel, of the Sixteenth District, was caught on a hot mike asking Bronx Borough President Rubén Díaz, Jr., for the chance to speak. \"If I didn't have a primary, I wouldn't care,\" Engel said, repeating himself to drive the point home.\n\nJamaal Bowman, a former middle-school principal, is Engel's most formidable opponent. Backed by Justice Democrats, the political action committee that helped elect Ocasio-Cortez, Bowman has collected endorsements from Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, and New York City's public advocate, Jumaane Williams. In a recent televised debate, Bowman, who grew up in New York City's Upper East Side, recounted first being racially profiled, when he was eleven. He was playing outside with friends and someone called the police, complaining of noise. \"The police didn't just approach us and ask us to be quiet-they handcuffed me, they threw me against the wall, they dragged my face on the ground,\" he said. \"I had to go upstairs and show my mother my face, which was all bruised up.\" Bowman went on to talk about bipartisan crime bills and restorative justice. Engel, by contrast, began his remarks by blaming Donald Trump for the unrest and boasting about being part of the impeachment hearings.\n\nThe protesters filling the nation's streets, many of whom may soon be heading to the polls, no doubt despise President Trump, but they also seem to understand that racism didn't begin with his election. As Bowman sees it, the problem lies with institutions, not individuals, whether they are bad Presidents or bad cops. \"Police brutality is a major component of institutional racism,\" he told me. \"But so are disparities in health care, housing, environmental justice, jobs, underfunded schools.\" These disparities are apparent in the Sixteenth District, which encompasses southern Westchester County and parts of the Bronx, and is one of the most unequal districts in the country.\n\nActivists have long been sounding the alarm about social inequities that go back decades and require deep structural changes, not superficial reforms. \"What the pandemic has done is put all of those on the accelerator,\" Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of Justice Democrats, said. \"There's only so much that the status quo can really say when it comes to fixing the fundamental problems that are so blatant and that everybody can see right now\"-from a mishandled public-health crisis to the shocking persistence of police misconduct. During the pandemic, tens of millions of people, who are disproportionately black and poor, have lost their jobs and their medical coverage and may soon face eviction. While elected officials of both parties granted corporations a multi-trillion-dollar bailout, George Floyd was killed for allegedly passing a counterfeit twenty-dollar bill. The fact that this month's protests kicked off in Democratic strongholds-including Minneapolis, New York, Los Angeles, and Atlanta-only underscores discontent with the Party's current leadership. Janeese George made this much plain, saying, \"Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner. Let's go all the way back. How many names can we name up until George Floyd where Democrats were in power?\"\n\nIt's incredibly hard to win a primary, and it's equally difficult for a challenger wave to maintain its momentum. Robert Boatright, a professor of political science at Clark University who studies primary elections, doesn't believe the contest for power within the Democratic Party is particularly remarkable. \"You always see a rise in challenges to incumbents when there is a surge toward one party or the other,\" he said. Most surges last a couple of election cycles, \"and then they go away.\" When Barack Obama was in the White House, the Tea Party targeted the Republicans, toppling incumbents or at least forcing them to watch their right flank. What we're seeing today is the left-wing counterpart of the same short-lived phenomena.\n\nThe candidates and activists I spoke to want to break that cycle; their goal is to build lasting infrastructure that can shift the balance of power in the Democratic Party toward a multiracial working class. To accomplish this, they'll need to invest in ways to identify, vet, and support potential candidates, training them in how to run for office and get out the vote. (Organized labor used to do this on a grander scale than it does now; first, you served as shop steward, then you aimed for City Hall.) The right has the Club for Growth and evangelical churches; the left has groups like Justice Democrats, Way to Win, and Brand New Congress, as well as nurses and teachers unions. George attended the Black Campaign School, an electoral boot camp, and was backed by the Working Families Party, the D.S.A., the local Black Lives Matter chapter, and multiple unions.\n\nAll the candidates I spoke to said that they are playing to win. But, for primary challengers, there can be victory in defeat. \"You can draw attention to your cause by running a primary campaign even if you're unsuccessful,\" Boatright said. It can also pay off to be dogged. That's why three of Justice Democrats' nine challenger candidates are running for a second time, including Marie Newman, in Illinois (the only victorious Democratic congressional primary challenger so far this cycle); Kara Eastman, in Nebraska; and Cori Bush, the nurse from St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nBush is attempting, once again, to unseat the ten-term incumbent Lacy Clay, whose father held the seat before him. A former teacher and pastor, and a single mother, Bush gained a national profile after being featured in the popular documentary \"Knock Down the House,\" which tracked her 2018 primary campaign along with those of three others, including Ocasio-Cortez. Bush helped organize the protests in Ferguson, in 2014, after Michael Brown was killed by police. When I spoke to her in early June, she had recovered from a two-month bout of what appeared to be COVID -19-related pneumonia, and had been out protesting once again, shouting the names of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd, and cheering on a new generation of demonstrators.\n\n\"I'm seeing some people have been traumatized, who are being retraumatized, but they decided to go back out there on that ground to fight in the face of death,\" Bush said. \"Because, you know, you can die on these streets. And they're standing out there making their voices heard.\" Change, Bush believes, is long overdue. \"People want to focus on all the property damage, and people want to call that violence,\" Bush said. \"But we wouldn't be here right now if the actual violence in our communities had been taken care of\"-that of poverty, hunger, lack of health care, and an absence of well-paid work, as well as police brutality. \"The people that are paid to take care of that, they haven't done it,\" she said.\n\nPointing to the uprising, Bush asked, \"What if that same tenacity, what if that same power and drive, was seated in Congress?\" If she wins the primary election, on August 4th, we may soon find out.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Post-Dirtbag Left\n\nOn the evening of January 6th, while National Guard troops were still trying to remove an insurrectionist mob from the Capitol, the right-wing activist L. Brent Bozell III appeared as a guest on Fox Business. \"They believe this election was stolen,\" he said, of the rioters. \"I agree with them. They are furious about the deep state. . . . I agree with them.\" He offered a limp concession or two-\"You cannot countenance our national Capitol being breached\"-but spent most of the segment zigzagging across the thin line between explanation and excuse. As many viewers would have known, Bozell's father, L. Brent Bozell, Jr., was a titanic figure in the history of modern American conservatism, his influence arguably second only to that of his co-author, brother-in-law, and former college-debate partner, William F. Buckley. What viewers would not have known-what even Brent III did not yet know, apparently-was that his son, also named L. Brent Bozell, was part of the insurrectionist mob. In fact, Brent IV, who goes by Zeek, was one of the few invaders to make it all the way to the Senate chamber.\n\nIn February, Zeek was charged with three federal crimes. A week and a half later, the two hosts of \" Know Your Enemy \"-a podcast, founded in 2019, that bills itself as \"a leftist's guide to the conservative movement\"-released a bonus episode called \"Keeping Up with the Bozells.\"\n\n\"It's a fastball right down the middle for us,\" Sam Adler-Bell, one of the hosts, said. The other host, Matthew Sitman, added, \"This is really a great opportunity for us to dive into some deep-cut conservative lore.\" It was less than two minutes into the episode, and already he had made a self-consciously erudite joke about Leo Strauss, and another about the Carlist movement in postwar Spain. \"Look, when there's Brent Bozells in the news,\" Adler-Bell continued, \"you want to hear 'Know Your Enemy' break it down for you.\"\n\nIf \"Know Your Enemy\" were like most podcasts, then an episode of this kind-pegged to the news, available only to subscribers-might have consisted of an hour or two of aimless riffing, a few apocryphal anecdotes, and some easy punch lines about how the mighty have fallen. Content production is a high-volume business, and professional talkers, especially political ones, almost always offer up old whines in new bottles. Sitman and Adler-Bell hawk a more artisanal product. To prepare for the episode, Adler-Bell had watched-\"for you, the listeners, and for my sins\"-hours of speeches by Brent III, including a histrionic 2015 appearance in which he compared the Obama Administration to the Stasi. Sitman drew on several articles and books by and about the Bozells, quoting most extensively from \" Living on Fire ,\" a biography of Brent, Jr., published by a small conservative press. (Listening to \"Know Your Enemy\" can feel like visiting a semi-reclusive friend whose apartment is crammed with out-of-print books, but who always keeps a stash of good bourbon on hand.) The hosts summarized the life of Brent, Sr., an adman in interwar Omaha, before devoting the bulk of the episode to Brent, Jr., who ghostwrote Barry Goldwater's 1960 best-seller, \" The Conscience of a Conservative \"; founded the Catholic magazine Triumph; and spent the end of his life advocating for an American brand of theocracy. The two living Brents were deemed less worthy adversaries. \"For us,\" Adler-Bell said, the figures worth scrutinizing \"are these weirdos who had a lot of idiosyncratic, terrible, dangerous, Fascist-sympathetic ideas, but nonetheless were interesting.\"\n\nSitman and Adler-Bell are serious, in other words, about the \"know\" part of their title. They seem more ambivalent about the \"enemy\" part. It's not that they're squishy about their politics: they have discussed at length what their socialist utopia would look like, and their only sustained disagreement during the 2020 primaries came in the form of Sitman, a die-hard Bernie Sanders fan, gently ribbing Adler-Bell for even entertaining the idea of supporting Elizabeth Warren. Their hesitancy has more to do with temperament. Last year, they interviewed the conservative Times columnist Ross Douthat, who has drawn leftists' ire for several of his pieces, including one called \" The Necessity of Stephen Miller .\" None of those columns came up. Even Douthat seemed to find the hosts' questions suspiciously magnanimous. (\"You're just softening me up, right?\") In an introduction recorded after the interview, the hosts warned listeners that what followed would be \"a conversation, not a debate.\" \"He's a nice guy,\" Sitman said, of Douthat. Adler-Bell agreed: \"It's annoying how nice he is.\"\n\nSitman grew up in a white working-class family in central Pennsylvania. His parents were self-described Christian fundamentalists and straight-ticket Republicans-\"God-and-guns voters,\" he called them, in a 2016 essay in Dissent -and, in college, he was, too. During his twenties, as a graduate student in political theory at Georgetown, he started to doubt the axioms of conservatism; by his mid-thirties, he was a Catholic, and a democratic socialist. (Adler-Bell, who was reared in Connecticut by secular leftists, didn't have to defect from much of anything.) Occasionally, Sitman speaks with the zeal of a convert. Once, while complaining about \"shitheads on the right\" who claim to be \"all Second Amendment\" but don't actually know how to shoot, he said, \"I was born with a King James Bible in one hand and a gun in the other, and I still know them both better than any of these guys.\" More often, though, he speaks with the guilt of a Catholic, the humility of a conflict-averse introvert, and the circumspection of someone who actually knows and loves working-class Republicans (and expects at least a few of them to tune in). In the \"Keeping Up with the Bozells\" episode, Sitman contrasted Brent III with his more illustrious father: \"What a letdown.\" Then, in the next breath, he apologized for the insult.\n\nAt times, this reflexive solicitousness can itself be a bit of a letdown. (Imagine Jesus, before squaring off with a Pharisee, promising \"a conversation, not a debate.\") Still, if forced to choose between not enough light and not enough heat, I'll take the latter every time. Sitman is a writer and an editor at Commonweal; Adler-Bell is a freelance writer whose work appears in The New Republic , Jewish Currents , and elsewhere. Like many coastal media types, they constantly mock themselves, often on Twitter, for spending too much time on Twitter. But they haven't allowed their personalities (or, at least, the personas they perform on the show) to be subsumed by the deadening collective affect of social media. \"What do you do if you're not a hot-take artist?\" Sitman asked, during an episode about Christopher Hitchens. (The episode, \"Sympathy for the Hitch,\" was another instance of the show treating its ideological opponents with grudging respect.) His answer, which he admitted was \"a little, maybe, self-serving\": \"I do find some of the complexity coming out in podcasts.\" If the currency of Twitter consists of eye-rolling quote-tweets, drive-by insults, and tortuously recursive in-jokes, then \"Know Your Enemy\" is, blessedly, in the online world but not of it.\n\nWhen the podcast \" Chapo Trap House \" began, in March of 2016, it served a real need. Millions of voters, disaffected and politically homeless, saw in Bernie Sanders an obvious solution to an array of systemic problems. \"Bernie won Michigan on Tuesday,\" Will Menaker, one of the co-hosts, said on the show's first episode. \"I'm not being facetious here . . . it has really kinda upset a lot of what I thought was gonna happen in this election.\" Later, when Sanders dropped out, the fact that he had come so close to eking out a victory made his defeat all the more painful. Many of his admirers-especially the young, angry, and very online ones-wanted to hear their outrage reflected back at them, not in temperate op-eds or both-sides TV punditry but through hyper-specific satire, historically literate left-wing analysis, and gleefully ad-hominem jokes about how John Podesta and Debbie Wasserman Schultz were neoliberal ghouls. \"I can't wait to watch the debates this fall, when Donald Trump is accusing Hillary Clinton of murder and of looking like a frump, which are equally horrible crimes in his mind, and she's gesturing to the moderator, being, like, 'This is just outrageous,' \" one of the hosts said, in the second episode. This was oddly prescient, but it wasn't a prediction you were likely to hear on MSNBC.\n\nAt the time, the co-hosts were Menaker and two other young(ish) bearded white guys, Felix Biederman and Matt Christman. (\"Chapo,\" like the mainstream media it critiques, has shown only belated and fitful interest in diversifying itself.) Christman, the one host with any red-state cred, was then living in Cincinnati. Biederman, originally from an affluent neighborhood in Chicago, and Menaker, whose parents met while working at this magazine, lived in Brooklyn and were trying to start careers in publishing. To this day, when people opine about \"Bernie bros,\" it's uncanny how often they seem to be talking, directly or indirectly, about these three individuals. Their banter could be stunted and sour, with an endless deployment of dick jokes and personal insults, but it was often undeniably trenchant, and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. (You won't find a better parody debate between Jordan Peterson and Slavoj Žižek, if you're into that sort of thing.) For a while, the show was doing something genuinely new.\n\n\"Chapo\" came to exemplify an online subculture that called itself the dirtbag left. Although its flagship products were podcasts (\"Chapo,\" \"Street Fight Radio,\" \"Cum Town\"), the dirtbag left derived its sensibility from niche Twitter, heightening the attributes that make social media both alluring (the specificity, the absurdity) and toxic (the nihilism, the narcissism, the casual sexism). Jon Stewart, who ended his \"Daily Show\" run in 2015, had adopted a pose of evenhanded populist anti-politics ( The system doesn't work because of the bozos in charge ); \"Chapo\" was more frankly anti-capitalist, and more terminally jaded ( This is how the system was designed to work). Years before the advent of audio-only apps like Clubhouse, dirtbag-left podcasts brought the infinite scroll to life, transforming the solitary habit of Twitter-lurking into a parasocial experience.\n\nSome listeners compared the \"Chapo\" hosts to earlier shock jocks like Don Imus and Rush Limbaugh. As a matter of substance, this was a false equivalence. On a purely affective level, though, there was something to it. \"Civility is destructive because it perpetuates falsehoods, while vulgarity can keep us honest,\" Amber A'Lee Frost, who later became a co-host, argued in a 2016 Current Affairs essay called \"The Necessity of Political Vulgarity.\" She gave some examples-\"Fuck tha Police,\" by N.W.A.; a series of \"pornographic little pamphlets\" distributed before the French Revolution-and concluded, \"Rudeness can be extremely politically useful.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nIt's also good business. \"Chapo\" is now the second most lucrative project on Patreon, grossing about two million dollars a year. With time, though, its style has hardened into shtick. During the 2020 primaries, the hosts were even more zealously Bernie-or-bust than they had been in 2016, and they now had a big enough audience to make a difference. (In the crucial weeks before Super Tuesday, the dirtbag left devoted much of its energy to strafing Elizabeth Warren's supporters, an approach that may have helped cost Sanders Warren's endorsement .) But, after Sanders's loss, \"Chapo\" seemed to have nothing left to say. Instead of progressing through the five stages of grief, the co-hosts wallowed in denial-\"It is still virtually tied,\" Menaker said, after Biden's decisive victory on Super Tuesday-before settling, apparently forever, in the second stage. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross called this stage anger, but in \"Chapo\" 's case it's closer to nihilistic despair.\n\nThe show's five-hundredth episode was recorded this February, on the anniversary of Sanders's victory in the 2020 Nevada caucus, which turned out to be the peak of his campaign. At the beginning of the episode, the co-hosts reminisced about that day, which they had spent in Las Vegas, canvassing for Sanders, then gathering to watch the returns come in. \"Bernie had just given his victory speech, and we were at a back-yard bar,\" Menaker recalled. \"Mingling, having drinks together, smoking cigarettes . . . that feeling was probably the last good thing that's ever gonna happen.\"\n\nThey tried to segue to the news of the day. Neera Tanden, a moderate Democrat and one of the dirtbag left's long-standing nemeses, had been nominated to be Biden's budget director, but her Senate confirmation hearing was being derailed by questions about controversial past tweets. (Her nomination was later withdrawn.) Menaker mentioned that he had been gloating about Tanden's demise, and that he'd received pushback from people arguing that Tanden's replacement would likely be more conservative than she was. \"Who cares?\" Menaker said, on the podcast. \"I don't give a shit who Biden appoints to his Cabinet.\"\n\n\"You think any of these people were gonna be good?\" Biederman said. \"No. They were all gonna fucking suck.\"\n\nOn a human level, some of this inspires actual pathos. As entertainment, or ideological analysis, it's not particularly revelatory. Many people-Bernie Sanders, for example-have argued that the Biden Administration is too conservative. It's certainly possible to rail against Biden's policies in Gaza, or at the Mexican border. But blanket fatalism is lazy and, perhaps more to the point, it's boring. Why keep tuning in if the angle is always the same?\n\nWhen the \"Chapo\" hosts are criticized for their rhetoric, they often resort to the same dodge that Jon Stewart used to trot out: Don't take us literally, we're just a comedy show . This didn't make sense when Stewart used it, and it makes even less sense in the case of \"Chapo,\" given that many of the jokes in question are not exactly professional-grade, and others, such as discouraging the audience from voting, don't seem like jokes at all. In \"The Necessity of Political Vulgarity,\" Frost wrote that Trump's \"vulgarity is appealing precisely because it exposes political truths.\" She and the other \"Chapo\" hosts didn't defend Trump's policies after he was elected, but they didn't pearl-clutch, either. Instead, they talked about how funny Trump was, or how weird his tweets were, or how hypocritical his most overwrought opponents sounded. This was politics as entertainment, politics as signifier-politics as anything but politics.\n\nThese days, the hosts often dispense with politics altogether, riffing about nineties films or quirky animal facts. \"Chapo\" is hardly the only podcast to indulge in frivolous tangents. Even the bookish \"Know Your Enemy\" has its prurient interests-speculating about the sexuality of William F. Buckley, say-and yet its obsessions seem organic, consistent with a sincere and sustained attempt to understand the right. On a recent episode, the hosts analyzed a \"truly awful conservative movie\" called \"Christmas Cars,\" mocking the film but also smuggling in salient observations about Lost Cause mythmaking and culture-war grift. I learn something each time I listen, which is more than I can say about nearly everything else I do with my phone.\n\nThe interests of \"Chapo,\" by contrast, seem increasingly arbitrary, the latest targets of the Twitter hive mind. The show's aesthetic has become indistinguishable from the extremely online aesthetic, which evinced at least a glimmer of potential in 2016 but has since only soured. At its worst, it derides any attempt at sincerity as try-hard, or cringe; better simply to shitpost and await our climate-induced collapse. Recently, the \"Chapo\" hosts spent the entirety of an eighty-one-minute episode making fun of \"Stars and Strife,\" a documentary directed by an investment banker named David Smick. They described various parts of the movie as \"unadulterated drivel\" and \"one of the most evil things I've ever seen\"; several times, they made jokes that involved likening Smick's head to a ham. I found the episode hard to finish-not because the humor was too vulgar, and not because the observations were unfounded, but because none of it seemed to matter. It was like watching the Harlem Globetrotters trounce the Washington Generals: the dunks were spectacular precisely because the stakes were so low.\n\nBack when \"Chapo\" had a near-monopoly on socialist podcasting, there was a common misconception that the only way to be a proper radical, at least online, was to mimic the temperament of the dirtbag left. Ideological preferences were conflated with affective ones; people who objected to \"Chapo\" on aesthetic grounds were sometimes suspected of being insufficiently committed to the cause. This presupposed that American politics consists of a single spectrum, on which Nazi-punching is to the left of civil disobedience and insults are to the left of arguments. But there isn't just one spectrum; at the very least, there's a quadrant grid, with policy goals on one axis and temperament on the other. The x -axis ranges from a fully planned economy to anarcho-capitalism; the y -axis ranges from solicitous Socratic dialogue to misanthropic bullying. They vary independently.\n\nIn April, on Twitter, a fan of \"Know Your Enemy\" wrote, \"I love this nerdy shit,\" referring to that show and to four broadly similar ones (\"Time to Say Goodbye,\" \"Left Anchor,\" \"Death Panel,\" and \"The Dig\"). If \"Chapo\" and its ilk make up the dirtbag left, the fan wondered, then what should this newer subgenre of podcasts be called? Adler-Bell tweeted two self-deprecating options: \"the 'not funny or cool' left\" and \"the 'your parents might like it' left.\" Others commented below, proposing alternatives: the dorkbag left, the Norton Critical Edition left, the \"joy to have in class\" left, the earnest left. Adler-Bell objected to the last of these, writing, \"You get a reputation for being earnest around here\"-Twitter, that is-\"you're in trouble.\" It was, appropriately enough, a glib way of making a sincere point. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "What It Was Like Being a Left-Wing Pundit on \"The O'Reilly Factor\"\n\nWhile strolling through the graceful town of Bellagio, Italy, on a bright summer morning in 2014, I stopped at an A.T.M. On a nearby restaurant patio, belonging to one of the grand lakeside hotels packed with tourists, I noticed an older man staring at me. Upon tendering my cash, I turned around to meet his glare. He pointed a finger at me and said, \"Hey. You. I recognize you.\" I was certain that he did not. He removed his sunglasses, and, with a bit of a grimace and a snort, he announced, \"You're the liberal-on 'O'Reilly' !\"\n\nI walked the few feet to his table and introduced myself. The fellow, from Michigan, was so tickled to have spotted someone from his beloved show at a cash point in Italy. I snickered at my own sad predicament. I've spent my life trying to be as deeply learned as I can-humanities research had brought me to this beautiful spot-and, lo and behold, my one nod of recognition that morning was as a left-wing mouthpiece on Fox. In subsequent years, when O'Reilly fans would stop me, almost always in nonpartisan tourist spaces (Times Square, airport lounges), I ceased being surprised: O'Reilly viewers were so fanatical that they could identify even his random, infrequent guests.\n\nI have always believed that coastal leftists need to step outside of our political and social comfort zones. In that spirit, I agreed to appear on \"The O'Reilly Factor\" five years ago with the strategic, if idealistic, calculation that roughly a quarter of O'Reilly's viewership had to be apolitical, moderate, and persuadable by fair-minded analysis. I typically appeared on the show to discuss heated economic and political topics: raising the minimum wage, the demands of Occupy Wall Street, police brutality, Stand Your Ground gun laws, and similar issues. Truth be told, early on, for left-wing mischief-makers, O'Reilly was like that beast you saw on safari-you wanted to shoot it and hang it as a trophy. Once, after I posted on Twitter about my imminent appearance, a longtime friend of mine texted, \"Jealous. My Mitty fantasy is to spar with that bastard. Good luck!\"\n\nI would appear on \"The O'Reilly Factor\" from its New York City studio, with O'Reilly sitting just feet from me, pancaked in makeup, stiff as a mummy. O'Reilly pioneered the gimmick now favored by other Fox hosts: pose a basic, neutral-sounding question and, as soon as an answer rolls from an opponent's tongue, immediately interrupt and ask a more hostile, complicated question. O'Reilly hoped that \"stepping on\" your answer right out of the gate would scramble your train of thought. As O'Reilly's opponent, you had to box with him aggressively to honor the viewpoint that you were defending yet be careful not to ridicule him too blatantly and risk alienating his viewers. Of course, the show was jerry-rigged to flatter its host and entertain its fans. But, despite my disgust with the format and with Fox in general, I felt that if I could get a sizable slice of O'Reilly's viewership to think fairly, for a few moments, about undocumented immigrants, corporate wage theft, or police brutality, my time would be well spent.\n\nO'Reilly pretended to hate \"identity politics,\" but his show was often a David-and-Goliath melodrama of identity politics, placing him and his right-wing viewers in the David role, as aggrieved victims of political correctness, as the industrious bootstrappers, and so on. In one of our encounters, we debated a strike among fast-food workers. O'Reilly boasted, \"My first job was at a Carvel ice-cream stand. I was paid minimum wage. . . . I understood that I was a rookie in the labor force and could get a recommendation from my future boss, so I didn't complain about the low pay. The next summer, before I went to college, I took a Red Cross course. I got my lifeguard certification and became a water-safety instructor. Immediately, I made five times more money than I made at Carvel.\"\n\nStruggling not to roll my eyes, I told Bill that he was living in the past. I informed him that most minimum-wage workers these days are not seventeen-year-old students on summer break. Two-thirds of the current minimum-wage work force consists of women, with a median age of thirty-two. \"I wish we could go back to that economy where the middle class wasn't hollowed out,\" I told his viewers. \"But, over the last couple of decades, we've seen workers work harder without being rewarded. These workers are wise to strike; I don't know anyone who can live on $7.25 an hour.\" Thanks to such a low minimum wage, many fast-food workers qualify for programs like Medicaid, energy assistance, and food assistance for children. Welfare is often a supplement to their hard work, not a substitute. In these and other matters, O'Reilly pretended to be a populist but he really favored corporate interests, especially big-box retailers and fast-food titans. That's why I find it especially delicious that a multi-billion-dollar corporation glanced at its bottom line and fired him .\n\nThe most caustic exchange I ever had with O'Reilly occurred when he invited me to discuss an Op-Ed that I had written for the Times . In that piece, I lamented that Trayvon Martin had been murdered by George Zimmerman \"in cold blood.\" O'Reilly had been a vehement apologist for the youth's killer. Our interview, ostensibly, was to center on Zimmerman's trial, but O'Reilly's hidden agenda was to shame me into taking my assertion back and to apologize to Zimmerman. I refused. I insisted that the black young man had in fact been murdered \"in cold blood.\" I reminded O'Reilly that Zimmerman was an unknown, suspicious-looking adult, and that Trayvon was just a teen-ager who deserved to be treated with dignity, especially as a minor. Outraged, Bill shouted, \"I don't care if he was four years old!\" There I sat, feet from O'Reilly and his world view: everyone should have a gun to defend himself, and the right to use it, even if a four-year-old is involved; and a vigilante's right to life supersedes that of an innocent black teen's.\n\nI could gauge the quality of my performance on \"The O'Reilly Factor\" by the response from viewers. When I received no response, I knew my efforts had fallen flat. In other instances, just minutes after wrapping up an appearance, my inbox would be flooded with choice feedback from his fans: \"Commie,\" \"Nigger,\" \"Buckwheat,\" \"Fag.\" These sorts of e-mails, combined with a series of hot, angry tweets, were an accurate measure of an effective appearance. In the thin-skinned ethos of O'Reilly's right-wing universe, the more you battered its poster boy with dead-on punches, the more ferocious the vitriol directed at you.\n\nThe intimate rapport O'Reilly developed with his followers sometimes transferred to his guests. Some fans pried into my life, asking personal questions. They opened up their lives to me by e-mail, sharing affecting accounts of their workplaces, homes, backgrounds, and challenges. Many e-mails from O'Reilly fans, whether I agreed with their conclusions or not, offered thoughtful, useful insights into this country's predicaments. They showed me the blind spots in my understanding of contemporary America-particularly how people's experiences, their class, and (usually) their whiteness shapes their public-policy perceptions. I credit O'Reilly's popularity to his fortunate timing. As legions of disaffected white Americans struggled with the economic, political, and demographic changes convulsing America, O'Reilly offered himself as a comrade and ringleader to shepherd them through.\n\nThere is a hopeful lesson from O'Reilly's comeuppance: the right mix of political and legal action, investigative journalism, and business scorn can deliver even the most powerful tyrant a stinging rebuke. O'Reilly and the former Fox C.E.O. Roger Ailes might be out the door because of the harassment charges levelled against them, but that leaves their angry network intact, still as comfortable as ever to crap on the environment, women, immigrants, black people, transgender people, scientific research, and anything smacking of progress. The fight is still on to persuade those members of Fox Nation who are willing to listen. Even though O'Reilly has been dislodged, his network, left unchanged, can always grow a new figurehead, hydra-like, in his place.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Turned Around\n\nThe biggest story of the past fifty years in American politics has been the ascendancy of the right, and it's a story of apostasy. At each stage of the conservative movement's long march to power, crucial aid was provided by heretics from the left. Progressives recoiled from the New Deal and turned reactionary; ex-Communists helped to launch National Review, in the nineteen-fifties; recovering socialists founded neoconservatism in the sixties and seventies; New Left radicals turned on their former comrades and former selves in the Reagan years. Ronald Reagan, whose Presidency brought the movement to its high-water mark, was himself once a New Deal liberal. In the course of a lifetime, the prevailing political winds are westerly-they blow from left to right. Try to think of public figures who made the opposite journey: Elizabeth Warren, Garry Wills, and Joan Didion come to mind, and Kevin Phillips, the disillusioned Nixon strategist; more recently, the writer Michael Lind and the Clinton-hater-turned-lover David Brock defected from the right to the left. That's about it.\n\nThe most common explanation is the one variously attributed to Churchill, Clemenceau, and Lloyd George: \"Any man who is not a socialist at age twenty has no heart. Any man who is still a socialist at age forty has no head.\" The move rightward is thus a sign of the hard wisdom that comes with age and experience-or, perhaps, the callousness and curdled dreams that accompany stability and success. Irving Kristol, the ex-Trotskyist who became the godfather of neoconservatism, quipped that a neoconservative was \"a liberal who has been mugged by reality.\" Most people are hardly aware of the shift until it's exposed by a crisis, like a major political realignment that forces us to cross party lines. Even then, they want to believe that it's the politics, not themselves, that changed. My maternal grandfather, George Huddleston, an Alabama congressman in the early decades of the twentieth century, began his career voting with the only Socialist in Congress and ended as a bitter opponent of what he saw as the federal overreach of the New Deal. In 1935, on the floor of the House, a Democratic colleague mocked him for reversing his position on public ownership of electric power. Fuming, Huddleston insisted, \"My principles and myself remain unchanged-it is the definition of 'liberalism' which has been changed.\" Or, as Reagan famously (and falsely) claimed, he didn't leave the Democratic Party-the Democratic Party left him.\n\nIt's like blaming your spouse for your own unfaithfulness. Political conversions are painful affairs, as hard to face up to as falling out of love or losing your religion. Or maybe harder. Religious faith, being beyond the reach of reason, doesn't have to answer gotcha questions about a previously held position. There's a special contempt reserved for the political apostate-an accusation of intellectual collapse, an odor of betrayal. When you switch sides, you have to find new friends. Political identities are shaped mainly by factors that have nothing to do with rational deliberation: family and tribal origins, character traits, historical currents. In \"Partisan Hearts and Minds,\" published in 2002, three political scientists made an empirical case that political affiliations form in early adulthood and seldom change. Few people can be reasoned into abandoning their politics.\n\nIn the twentieth century, the void left by the loss of religion was sometimes filled by totalizing political systems, and the result was a literary genre of confession that is as powerful and probing as the Augustinian kind. \"The God That Failed,\" published in 1950, compiled personal narratives by six former Communists and fellow-travellers, including André Gide, Arthur Koestler, Ignazio Silone, and Richard Wright. Each one told a tale of coming of age in a world riven with crisis, finding meaning in Marxism, identity in the Party, and inspiration in the Soviet Union, gradually growing disillusioned, and finally breaking with Communism. In some cases, it was an experience akin to watching a former self die. It was nearly impossible for these writers to discover a new faith, political or religious, to replace Communism and its power to erase the sense of insignificance that awaits any sentient person.\n\nTwo years later, in 1952, came \"Witness,\" by the century's most tormented ex-Communist, Whittaker Chambers. Daniel Oppenheimer's sequence of biographical essays about six left-wing defectors, \"Exit Right: The People Who Left the Left and Reshaped the American Century\" (Simon & Schuster), begins with Chambers. This is Oppenheimer's first book, but he writes with the assurance and historical command of someone who has been thinking about his topic for a long time. The colors of his own flag are hard to discern, which makes him a reliable guide. His sympathy goes to the candidly conflicted, the nakedly shattered. He wants to know why people come to hold the political beliefs they do. Stories of apostasy, he writes, \"are worth telling because it's during the period of political transition, when the bones of one's belief system are broken and poking out through the skin, that the contingency and complexity of belief become most visible.\" This quest is particularly relevant at a time when Americans are dug deep into two opposing trenches, and crossing no man's land is a great way to get picked off.\n\nOppenheimer never quite answers his central question: \"Exit Right\" is more history than political theory and psychology. Its mini-biographies provide the author with enough thread to weave the larger story of the American left in the twentieth century, from the Daily Worker to the Hitler-Stalin Pact, from the House Un-American Activities Committee to \"The Fire Next Time,\" from Partisan Review to Ramparts , from Vietnam to 9/11. In addition to Chambers, there's James Burnham, a Trotskyist philosopher of the nineteen-thirties who became a founding editor of National Review; Ronald Reagan, who started out closer to the mainstream than any of the others; Norman Podhoretz, who, in the sixties, took Commentary first leftward and then rightward with him; David Horowitz, the son of Communist Party members and a radical friend of the Black Panthers, until their violence sent him fleeing to Reaganism; and Christopher Hitchens, who belongs in another category, having never been an orthodox leftist and having never really fit with the new conservative friends of his final decade.\n\nAmong the six characters, there's no recurring type, only a hectic impulse toward self-revision that is captured in a line from Clifford Odets's play \"Paradise Lost\": \"We cancel our experience. This is an American habit.\" But each tale of defection reveals a personal temper that makes these men passionately hostile to the politics of pluralism. They embrace new truths with the convert's fervor and certitude-Oppenheimer's \"contingency and complexity of belief\" is not for them. What they loathe most is liberalism.\n\nChambers's tale is one of suffering and high drama out of Dostoyevsky. \"Life is pain,\" he wrote to his children in the letter that prefaces \"Witness,\" and \"each of us hangs always upon the cross of himself.\" For Chambers, politics was religious, a continual struggle between good and evil, and the only form of political commitment was absolute. His story has already been told extremely well twice-first in the morbid exaltations of \"Witness,\" then in Sam Tanenhaus's magisterial biography, from 1997, both essential sources for Oppenheimer. Chambers was born in 1901 and grew up on Long Island, in a middle-class family whose chaos and decay gave the boy intimations of a wider illness in the modern world. His father, a half-closeted homosexual, was cruel to Whittaker; his mother was a loving but deeply neurotic woman; his brother was a future suicide. The Chambers house fell into disrepair, along with Whittaker's teeth. Oppenheimer devotes a lot of space to Chambers's early years, because they explain his flight into the encompassing arms of the Communist Party, in 1925. \"It offered me what nothing else in the dying world had power to offer at the same intensity,\" he wrote in \"Witness\"-\"faith and a vision, something for which to live and something for which to die.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nIn 1932, Chambers became an agent of the Communist underground, and within a few years he was serving as a courier between a cell of officials in the Roosevelt Administration and their coarse, brutal Soviet handler, Boris Bykov, who could have come from Koestler's \"Darkness at Noon.\" While passing along microfilmed government secrets to the Soviets, Chambers, married and a father, was able to indulge his attraction to men. Cruising followed some of the same patterns as spying: \"A large part of his job was to move in the shadows, to exchange meaningful glances with strangers, to take midnight ambles punctuated with intervals of purposeful loitering.\"\n\nThere was no single reason that Chambers ceased to be a Communist. In \"Witness,\" he says the break began when his daughter was eating porridge in her high chair, and he came to the realization that she-and, more specifically, her ear-had been created by some design. But he stayed in the Party for years after feeling the finger of God on his forehead. Around 1936, news of the Moscow purge trials of leading Bolsheviks began to make its way to those in America willing to hear-and Chambers didn't close his mind to the terrible truth. (Millions of people perished in what came to be called the Great Terror.) There was also \"the accumulated tedium of years of underground work, and how little there was to show for it,\" Oppenheimer writes. \"There were the sappingly antisocial patterns of underground life, all the dislocations and secrecy and lying.\" In \"Witness,\" though, Chambers describes his reason in the simplest terms: \"This is evil, absolute evil. Of this evil I am a part.\"\n\nThe metaphysical strain is what makes Chambers different from most of the millions of other Communist believers who wasted their years and corrupted themselves before losing their faith, and what makes \"Witness\" a successor to Augustine's \"Confessions\" and Bunyan's \"Pilgrim's Progress.\" The autobiography has little to say about dialectical materialism, social fascism, or the Popular Front. After reading \"Witness,\" the critic Harold Rosenberg said, \"This man is not interested in politics.\" When Chambers let his friend Alger Hiss, a State Department official and fellow-spy, know that he was on his way out, he tried to persuade him to leave, too. But Hiss was a bureaucrat, not a soul in Hell, and he brushed Chambers off: \"What you have been saying is just mental masturbation.\"\n\nChambers's break with the Party put his and his family's life in jeopardy, and it plunged him into an inevitable spiritual crisis. He couldn't bear to live without a purpose. He began to pray to the Being who had created his daughter's ear; he became a Christian. \"In God,\" Oppenheimer writes, \"he'd found a replacement vision that seemed deep enough to sustain him emotionally and rich enough, in its explanatory power, to provide answers to the questions about modern life that still haunted him.\" Oppenheimer leaves the story there. He doesn't describe Chambers's subsequent career as Henry Luce's star writer at Time , or his sudden fame (and infamy) when, in 1948, Representative Richard Nixon put him under the lights and elicited his testimony against Hiss (who denied everything, then and for the rest of his long life). The Hiss-Chambers faceoff in Congress and the courts divided Americans; in a way, it was the opening battle in the culture wars of the past half century. Perhaps Oppenheimer felt that this dénouement was already familiar, or superfluous to his main concern.\n\nBut Chambers didn't become just an anti-Communist. In substituting God for Stalin, he pointed his sword at what he called \"man's second oldest faith.\" He went on, \"Its promise was whispered in the first days of the Creation under the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil: 'Ye shall be as gods.' It is the great alternative faith of mankind.\" Chambers was a Manichaean, and to him the Hiss case was a conflict between God and Man without God. The enemy wasn't merely Communism-it was \"those who believe in the primacy of secular Man.\" This is why, when he became a heretic, in 1938, Chambers didn't turn to New Deal liberalism. Disillusionment with the liberal values of skepticism, tolerance, and reason had driven him to Communism in 1925, and the same aversion made him a high priest of the religious right. The worst thing was to be muddled. An old friend told Chambers, near the end of his life, \"You never changed, Whit, you just changed sides.\"\n\nOppenheimer's heretics aren't conservatives at all, in the spirit of Edmund Burke or Russell Kirk. Incremental progress isn't a strong enough drink-they need a perpetual showdown, a binary apocalypse. Along with their disdain for liberalism, there's a tendency to admire history's hard men. You sense it in the story of James Burnham, who passed through the inferno of the thirties unscathed, because, unlike Chambers, he lived it intellectually, not spiritually. Chambers replaced one zealous faith with another; Burnham-a nearly forgotten figure who dominated the scene while he was alive-kept changing systems. He was a well-off native of Chicago, a brilliant student at Princeton and Oxford, and then a philosophy professor at New York University. He became a Marxist after the crash of 1929, when he made the acquaintance of his departmental colleague Sidney Hook and read Trotsky's \"History of the Russian Revolution.\" A driving tour in the summer of 1933 through the Depression-stricken cities of the Midwest sealed the deal.\n\nAmerican Trotskyists led a couple of industrial strikes, but their main action was on paper and in meetings-essays and ripostes in The New International , factional fights, disputes over the proper definition of the Soviet Union (degenerated workers' state? bureaucratic collectivism?). When, toward the end of the thirties, famous comrades like Hook and the writer Max Eastman began to turn away from revolutionary Marxism and toward \"good old-fashioned liberalism and bourgeois moralism,\" Burnham set about dismantling their efforts with the full force of his systematic intellect. His scorn was all the more withering because he, too, was starting to question the truth of Marxist dialectics. \"I stopped arguing about religion long ago,\" he remarked to a comrade, and when the line got back to Trotsky, in his Mexican exile, the two men exchanged a series of increasingly ferocious essays and letters that couldn't conceal personal hurt.\n\nIn April, 1940, Burnham helped to form a splinter party of disillusioned Trotskyists, then immediately quit. \"To the degree that he still shared any strong convictions with the new party, they were almost exclusively negative convictions,\" Oppenheimer writes. \"The Soviet Union wasn't a workers' state anymore. The world war was an imperialist war, fought by all sides in the pursuit of profits and territories. The era of bourgeois liberalism was over.\" But Burnham had never given up his bourgeois trappings-the Princeton friends, the comfortable family life, the position at N.Y.U. \"There was a visible, plausible life for Burnham on the other side,\" Oppenheimer writes.\n\nOppenheimer leaves Burnham too soon as well, at the end of his Marxist years-stopping short of Trotsky's murder, in August of 1940, by an ice-pick-wielding agent of Stalin. We don't learn about the books and ideas for which Burnham became best known: \"The Managerial Revolution,\" published in 1941, which announced the rise of new totalitarian superstates, neither capitalist nor socialist but collectivist, controlled by a caste of \"managers\"; \"The Struggle for the World,\" a postwar tract that predicted and implicitly called for a third world war; and \"Suicide of the West,\" published in 1964. \"Liberalism,\" Burnham stated-meaning belief in reason-\"is the ideology of Western suicide.\" His predictions, consistently wrong, were always in effect the same one: democracy was doomed, and deservingly so, because it was too soft.\n\nLink copied\n\nIn 1983, President Reagan awarded Burnham-by then ailing and in his last years-the Medal of Freedom. In 1984, Chambers received it posthumously. Reagan claimed both men as major influences-he read and reread \"Witness\" until, Oppenheimer notes, \"its cadences were native to him, memorizing entire passages, quoting and paraphrasing them at length in political speeches\"-but their pessimism sat uneasily next to his sunny faith in the providential American future. Oppenheimer tells the familiar story of Reagan's youthful ardor for Roosevelt; his career as a Hollywood labor leader; his growing hostility to Communist infiltration of the unions; and his turn to the right when he became a pitchman for General Electric, began to associate with anti-Communists, and married Nancy Davis. Reagan ascribed his defection to \"the newfangled 'liberals' who rejected\" Roosevelt's faith in the wisdom of the American people, and who instead entrusted power to government engineers. It's a sentimental and ahistorical view. Roosevelt allowed Communists like Hiss to go on working for him even after being presented with Chambers's account of their perfidy, and he was more statist than the \"newfangled\" Democrats of the Eisenhower era.\n\nReagan needed to believe himself incapable of disloyalty to his father and to the President they both revered. Those attachments were part of the narrative of patriotism and virtue that remained constant throughout his life. \"He'd been a liberal because it was his inheritance,\" Oppenheimer writes. \"But the fit had never been completely comfortable. And as the reasons to keep bargaining with the old liberalism fell away, one by one, he began to accept that there was another mantle that might drape more comfortably.\"\n\nWithout anti-communism to give it shape and meaning, the quality of apostasy goes into decline in the course of the book. Podhoretz, born in the generation after Chambers, Burnham, and Reagan, is a conundrum-an irascible, narcissistic, \"ravenously ambitious\" writer and editor of considerable talent, but with nothing overwhelmingly urgent to say. In his mildly leftist younger years, the political question was: \"What did it all mean for him?\" In the nineteen-fifties, he sensed the country's restlessness because he felt it in himself; in the sixties, as the editor of Commentary , he embraced the new spirit. The decade's star writer, his friend Norman Mailer, was more talented and more free, and filled Podhoretz with excitement and competitive envy.\n\nThen, in 1967, he published a memoir called \"Making It,\" a confession and a celebration of his hunger for success. Podhoretz saw himself as the one intellectual willing to tell the truth about the importance of money and fame and social status to supposedly high-minded people, and in telling it he imagined that all of these would accrue to him in greater amounts. Instead, the book was reviled, and by the writers he most admired. \" 'Making It' generated an almost physiological cringe in its critics,\" Oppenheimer writes. The coup de grâce was delivered by Mailer himself, who, in Partisan Review, the holy grail of the New York intellectuals, called it \"a blunder of self-assertion, self-exposure, and self-denigration.\" (Literary moves that were safe only in the skilled hands of Norman Mailer.)\n\nPodhoretz went into a depression so black that it lasted two years. It ended one day in 1970, when, outside his summer farmhouse, Martini in hand, he had a vision, Chambers-like. At the depth of his crisis in trying to leave the Party, Chambers had heard a voice saying, \"If you will fight for freedom, all will be well with you\"-an intimation of divinity, to which he surrendered. Three decades later, Podhoretz looked up at the sky and, he later recalled, beheld \"a kind of diagram that resembled a family tree. And it was instantly clear to me that this diagram contained the secret of life and existence and knowledge: that you start with this, and you follow to that.\"\n\nThe diagram pointed Podhoretz away from radical freedom, toward the binding identities of religion and family and nationality. He had always argued for the legitimate claims of self-interest, ethnic and otherwise, and he itched to pop the more fragile bubbles of liberal idealism, as in his 1963 essay \"My Negro Problem-And Ours.\" Now he turned bitterly against the shibboleths of the left and began to tell himself a comforting story: that the brutal response to \"Making It\" was political. It revealed the hypocrisy of liberal intellectuals who wouldn't acknowledge the good their country had done them. As Oppenheimer puts it, with fine irony, \"Podhoretz began to reorganize his very self around the fight to win the war he hadn't been aware he was launching when he wrote Making It -in defense of America against the barbarians of the Left.\"\n\nBy one standard, Podhoretz emerged victorious from the sixties: leftism rapidly burned out, while his neoconservatism fed magazines and think tanks and White Houses for the next generation. He kept insisting, though never convincingly, that he was glad to be rid of his old friends; he became a dogmatic sourpuss and ended up a fan of Sarah Palin. It's hard to imagine Chambers landing there, but then politics had a different meaning for him.\n\nDavid Horowitz was an editor of Ramparts in the late sixties and the seventies-just the kind of cocky New Left radical, thundering against criminal Amerika, who drove older lefties like Podhoretz to neoconservatism. For Horowitz, the Moscow trials came in the form of the Black Panther Party's descent into criminal gangsterism. In late 1974, he asked a woman from Ramparts named Betty Van Patter to be a bookkeeper for a school run by the Panthers in Oakland. When her bludgeoned corpse washed up from San Francisco Bay, Horowitz concluded that the Panthers, and he, were responsible. In the ensuing years of self-recrimination, his Marxism died, though, like Chambers, he felt that his life might be at risk if he declared his defection too openly or too soon. The existential vision came in a Berkeley bookstore, amid shelf after shelf of titles: suddenly the Marxist ones, including his own, meant no more than any others. \"For the first time in my conscious life I was looking at myself in my human nakedness,\" he later wrote, \"without the support of revolutionary hopes, without the faith in a revolutionary future-without the sense of self-importance conferred by the role I would play in remaking the world. . . . I was nothing. \"\n\nHorowitz followed a path similar to Chambers's: both were total creatures of Marxist belief, who confronted brutal revelations about their comrades, abandoned the revolutionary movement, and were driven to crippling despair. After a lukewarm stopover in liberalism (he voted for Jimmy Carter in 1980), Horowitz defected to the Reagan-era right and became a provocateur, choosing race and campus politics as his battleground. There he met enough intolerance to keep his anger at the left and his former self perpetually stoked. But identity politics doesn't offer as worthy an enemy as the global Communist conspiracy. Chambers, Burnham, and Reagan became conservatives in response to an ideology they believed to be evil. Podhoretz and Horowitz were reacting against something more like stupidity.\n\nThe lives in \"Exit Right\" belong decidedly to the past. The denunciations and warnings from today's ex-leftists seem wildly exaggerated: the less real power the left has in American life, the more dire its image on the right grows. An anthology called \"Why I Turned Right,\" published in 2007, collected the latest generation's tales of heresy. It's a long way from \"The God That Failed\": most of the authors never got over their first encounters with those ruthless juggernauts of history, critical theory and campus feminism. Chambers thought he was defecting to the losing side, and even now conservatives feel like a beleaguered minority; meanwhile, the right has secured power in just about every American institution except the academy. Political correctness is, in part, a reaction to the defeat of the left's egalitarian dreams, the kind of mutation that occurs in isolation from the larger gene pool. If you can't overturn Citizens United, you can at least rename a university building.\n\nWe're due for a new crop of writers to start recording their disillusionment-this time with the right. The downward slide from Chambers and Reagan to Coulter and Trump has surely swept along a few young idealists who thought they were joining the side of freedom and truth, then realized too late that they had signed on for junk science and white identity politics. Ted Cruz's vision would require the toppling of just about every pillar of the country's social and economic structure. You don't have to look elsewhere for the destructive utopianism that turns believers into apostates. In a few years' time, we'll be reading the chilling inside story, written by a campaign aide who barely got out alive. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Leftist Case for Voting-Yes, Even for Biden\n\nThere's a surplus of despair in the American far left these days.\n\nBetween Joe Biden's ongoing support for the mass slaughter in Gaza, the Supreme Court's abysmally craven decision to grant Donald Trump near-total legal immunity , and the chaotic fallout from the first presidential debate , those who once might have voted for Bernie Sanders are finding quite little to feel hopeful about. As a result, more than a few people on the left are thinking about not voting altogether . I see the grim, burn-it-all-down sentiments stream past my eyes on my social feeds all day, every day.\n\nFirst of all: I get it.\n\nLet's say Biden remains the Democratic candidate. If a leftist thinks of a vote as a moral endorsement of a politician, then the case for them abstaining is straightforward. They don't want to empower Biden, who has been tepid (at best) on core left priorities like restraining state violence , defending abortion , enshrining trans rights , and-perhaps most importantly - stopping the carnage in Palestine . This was all the case before he showed himself to be perhaps dangerously infirm .\n\nLeftists who don't like Biden don't want to see him in office again, so they don't want to vote for him, or they want to withhold their vote until he changes course. Seems simple enough.\n\nBut that's not how politics works.\n\nThe point of electoral politics, as it is lived, is not to vote for a friend; it's to vote for your preferred enemy. You will never find a morally pure candidate, or one whose positions perfectly align with your own preferences. So you must find one whom you can effectively bully.\n\nIt's often said that desiring to be president is a psychosis that should disqualify anyone who actually wants the job. I happen to agree. Never, in the history of this country, has there been a president who hasn't engaged in what the left would regard as unforgivable crimes. This is the nature of presidents, and politicians in general. If you, like me, are on the far left, you should never fully trust or have faith in any elected official.\n\nBut when I look at the Biden administration, I see a group of people who can be bullied in a leftist direction on some policy priorities. They have, at times, responded to pressure from their left wing in Congress ( the so-called Squad and others ), as well as pressure from unions and advocacy campaigns . They've already made huge strides on climate , they've brought forward anti-monopoly cases , and they pulled out of Afghanistan, among other actions.\n\nIt's far less than what is needed, to be sure-but it's far more than what we're going to get if the left withholds its vote in significant numbers.\n\nWhenever I get into arguments about voting with my more hardcore friends, the conversation always turns sour when we get to this question: What happens when Biden loses in November?\n\nThe answer, of course, is that Trump becomes president again. And Project 2025 flies into effect. And the country goes mask-off fascist. And trans people like me become illegal by our very existence. And Israel \" finishes the job \" in Gaza with vocal cheering from the White House. And Trump has his enemies imprisoned or worse with impunity. And the world teeters on the brink. And so on.\n\nUsually, when I get to this portion of my rant with these friends, they say they think all that stuff will happen whether or not they vote. There's a tendency to say Biden is just as bad as Trump, or that Trump will be able to take power even if Biden gets more votes. They've completely lost faith in the system.\n\nOnce again: Yes, this system is broken! It's always been broken! But are you really going to argue that elections don't have consequences?\n\nWhen I was 14 years old, I was a huge fan of Ralph Nader. As a teenage anti-sweatshop activist, I believed that he was the only candidate in the 2000 presidential election who was speaking the truth and advocating for my policy goals. I went to a Nader rally in my hometown of Chicago, where the great journalist Studs Terkel spoke. I'll never forget what he said in his nasal bark: \"Gore or Bush, what's your choice? Influenza or pneumonia, what's your choice?\"\n\nIt all sounds like nonsense to me now. Can anyone today truly argue that the world wasn't drastically changed by Gore's loss in 2000? Even if you don't accept the argument that Nader's candidacy is what lost Gore the election, how can you argue that the world wouldn't have been at least a little better if all of those Nader votes had gone to Gore and put the Dems over the top?\n\nIt's difficult to understand what the don't-vote leftists think they will accomplish as a result of Biden losing. Do they hope that the worsening conditions will bring about the Revolution? Be serious. Where is the radical left that could make such a thing happen? Where is the leftist infrastructure, unity, or discipline that would be necessary for a triumph at the national level from American communists, anarchists, or even socialists?\n\nIn Weimar Germany, where the German Communist Party was far more robust and ready to fight in the streets, the revolution-oriented strategy-allowing a fascist victory to raise urgency and bring about a more lasting leftist one-didn't work. Infamously, in the fateful early years of the 1930s, the German Communists viciously opposed the governing center-left Social Democratic Party. Calling the centrists \" Social Fascists ,\" they declared that there was no substantive difference between liberalism and Nazism. They refused to ally themselves with the center.\n\nAlthough the Communists did not originate the much-quoted phrase \"Nach Hitler, kommen wir\" (\"After Hitler, we're coming\"), it was very much their policy. The belief was that Hitler might come to power, but that Nazi misrule would only rally support to the Communists, leading to a glorious revolution.\n\nWell, it didn't go that way, did it?\n\nInstead of echoing the hardline leftists of 1931, the American left should look to their counterparts in France of 2024 . The world has breathed a sigh of relief over the shocking upset against Marine Le Pen's far-right party in the recent legislative elections there. The key to that victory was a last-minute alliance of the centrist liberals and the radical left. It worked.\n\nWith any luck, the French left will follow through by using their legislative plurality to bully their centrist president into being better. It won't be a revolution, but I'll certainly take it over Vichy 2.0. Let us follow their example.\n\nThere's still time to avoid the omnicatastrophe that would be a fascist takeover of the nuclear-armed United States. We don't have to play the organizing game on the highest difficulty level, which is what the left is looking at in the event of a Trump victory. The man all but wants to formally establish a Christian dictatorship, dismantle the very idea of federal regulations, outlaw contraception, and round up and deport millions of immigrants. And that's just a taste of the hellish chaos that looms.\n\nThe ballot box might not be enough, but we cannot abandon it out of depressive nihilism. We must build an alternative political structure and put pressure on politicians every day, not just once every four years. But we won't have the opportunity to do that if Trump is president and makes such organizing illegal.\n\nLeon Trotsky himself urged the German Communists to reconsider their foolish pride in 1931. \"Should fascism come to power, it will ride over your skulls and spines like a terrific tank,\" he declared , accurately. \"Your salvation lies in merciless struggle. And only a fighting unity with the Social Democratic workers can bring victory. Make haste, worker-Communists, you have very little time left!\"\n\nOnce again, the hour grows late. This November, leftist apathy can only bring disaster. Workers of the world, unite with your liberal foes; if you do not, you have everything to lose.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Leftists for Trump: What Is to Be Done About These Insufferable Nihilists?\n\nPeople who believe that it would be \"clarifying\" if the \"republic degenerates into tyranny,\" probably should pull the lever for Trump; they are his natural constituency.\n\nPhoto illustration by Sofya Levina. Images by David McNew/Getty Images and John Moore/Getty Images\n\nLast month, the left-wing writer Freddie de Boer tweeted his desire to see a \"liberal Democrat writer in the media ... write a piece making a good faith effort to consider liberal attacks on the left.\" The challenge stuck in my mind, because I'm aware of my own antipathy to many types of left-wing affect, and I often feel guilty about it and wonder if it's a rationalization for my own smug complacency. (Liberals, unlike leftists, are given to neurotic questioning of their own motives.) After all, I would like to see America move toward Scandinavian-style social democracy, and that's not going to happen without serious left-wing agitation. Why, then, does the left-that is, people who want revolution rather than reform-regularly infuriate me? I'm willing to stipulate that part of it is that leftists make me feel bad about my own bougie accommodation to the status quo. Another part, though, is that I recoil from a personality type-not uncommon in radical movements-that treats politics as a realm in which to enact revenge on society for its own alienation and to claim a starring role in history. That is, people like Christopher Ketcham.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ketcham published a piece in the Daily Beast titled \"Anarchists For Trump-Let the Empire Burn.\" Ketcham, who writes that he donated hundreds of dollars to Bernie Sanders, now plans to support Donald Trump in the general election. \"What's needed now in American politics is consternation, confusion, dissension, disorder, chaos-and crisis, with possible resolution-and a Trump presidency is the best chance for this true progress,\" he writes.  \"This is a politics of arson. I'd rather see the empire burn to the ground under Trump, opening up at least the possibility of radical change, than cruise on autopilot under Clinton.\"\n\nThis is a more forceful rendition of the argument that Susan Sarandon floated on MSNBC in March, when she said, \"Some people feel that Donald Trump will bring the revolution immediately if he gets in, things will really explode.\" It's a jejune version of the Bolshevik slogan \"The worse, the better,\" which meant that deteriorating social conditions would radicalize the populace and empower the left.\n\nA few seconds' reflection is enough to realize that this isn't how American politics work. When the right is in power, the political center of gravity moves right as well. Bill Clinton's hated style of triangulation was a reaction to eight years of Ronald Reagan followed by four of George H.W. Bush, a period in which liberalism came to be seen as a massive electoral liability. During George W. Bush's administration, the most visible left-wing counterweight was the Netroots, which was basically a movement of centrist Democrats. The left flourishes when Democrats are in power, raising people's political expectations. The Bernie Sanders movement is possible because, for young people, the notion of a liberal, urbane black president is a starting point rather than a miracle.\n\nKetcham is, naturally, blithely uninterested in reckoning with the human cost of the political apocalypse he fantasizes about. There's not a word in his piece about the immigrants who would be rounded up and put into detention camps under Trump's plan, or the people of color who would be terrorized by a total breakdown in the norms that make even an imperfect multiethnic democracy possible. This is not surprising. What is surprising is that Ketcham, as well as the likeminded people he quotes, are so forthright about seeing politics purely in terms of personal catharsis. He cites an \"editor of a major progressive website\" who is a covert Trump supporter, and who says, \"To the extent that voting for president matters at all, it is merely to give a certain secret pleasure to the voter in the privacy of the booth.\"\n\nYou get the sense, reading the piece, that Ketcham thinks he's shocking the bourgeoisie by opening a window into a nihilist demimonde. \"Travelling across the country, I keep meeting people who voted for Sanders in the primaries but mutter under cover of night and a few drinks that they'll vote for Trump in November,\" he writes. \"Friends out in the wildlands of the intermountain West, hard gun-toting anarchist redneck Amy Goodman progressives, say so. Big-city journalists, too. I suspect that the left-contrarian, anti-Hillary, pro-Trump arsonist crowd is larger and wider-spread than the cubicled creatures in the Clinton campaign have accounted for.\" I have no idea if this is true. But insofar as it is, it confirms every stereotype that supercilious liberals have about self-styled radicals. I suspect that is why the Daily Beast published Ketcham's piece in the first place. (Well, that and the clicks.)\n\nI'm not interested in berating people who feel this way into changing their votes. Clinton can win without mobilizing the armed anarchist listeners of Democracy Now! People who believe that it would be \"clarifying\" if the \"republic degenerates into tyranny,\" as Ketcham does, probably should pull the lever for Trump; they are his natural constituency. I know these cosplay revolutionaries, to paraphrase Dave Weigel , don't represent the real left. They're certainly not the heroic people organizing fast-food workers or agitating to head off climate cataclysm. But a softer version of Ketcham's sentiment is out there among the Bernie-or-Bust crowd ; in March, the Guardian heard from 500 Sanders supporters who were considering voting for Trump over Clinton. It's there, too, in the people on the left who are furious about the prospect of Elizabeth Warren joining Clinton's ticket . Increasingly, a vocal part of the left is marked by its contempt for liberalism. The feeling is often mutual.\n\nRead more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Bring Back the Sewer Socialists!\n\n\"There's no Republican or Democratic way to pick up the garbage,\" goes a famous quip usually attributed to New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia. The meaning is clear: Running a city government requires elected officials to be pragmatic, deliver services, and check their ideology at the door. It's a witty but misleading quote. Providing public services might technically be a nonpartisan matter, but it's hardly a nonideological one. How to distribute power between the public and private sectors, which services to cut first when budgets are tight, whether decisions should be made by civil servants or elected officials-these are values-based questions, not empirical ones.\n\nNew Yorkers have had more immediate reasons lately to think about garbage pickup: 1) It's summer and therefore Hot Trash Season ; and 2) the city's former sanitation commissioner, Kathryn Garcia, came within one percentage point during ranked choice voting of winning the Democratic primary for mayor. Garcia was a lifelong civil servant whose pitch to voters was almost entirely about her own competence and managerial skill; she promised to \"get shit done,\" a wry nod to her past in sanitation and sewage. Her policy positions were mostly moderate, but her message contained a kernel that the city's progressive left can adapt and make its own after a disappointing showing in the mayoral race. The most electorally successful leftists in U.S. history ran and governed on this very kernel-the belief that delivering basic services, building public works, and running a functional local government are inseparable from what it means to govern from the left in a major city.\n\nThat Garcia came so close to victory, despite no political experience and almost no name recognition before the race, means her message hit a nerve. There's a lesson there for candidates across the country. Maya Wiley, the left-most major candidate in the race, mostly campaigned on nonprofit-esque platitudes after serving as Mayor Bill de Blasio's counsel. Garcia offered New Yorkers a clear value proposition instead: improving the public services they rely on for daily life. The eventual primary winner and now presumptive next mayor Eric Adams was always going to be a formidable candidate, given his rock-solid support from some of the city's largest voting blocs and his close ties to labor, real estate, and the traditional Democratic machine. But Adams has vulnerabilities: He is openly tolerant of corruption , and said the party hacks at New York's patronage-riddled Board of Elections did a \"great job\" . ( Narrator: They did not. ) If Adams won't promote good governance, the city's progressive left should do it instead. Voters who lack strong ideological beliefs but simply want the city's many public services to work well might be willing to take a chance on something new in order to avoid dysfunction and stagnation.\n\nWhen I say \"the progressive left,\" it's shorthand for the forces ranging from loyal liberal Democrats to leftists who reject capitalism and are hostile to the Democratic Party. Most major U.S. cities have some version of this formation, which in New York is anchored respectively by the Working Families Party and the Democratic Socialists of America (who only endorse self-identified socialists, and thus didn't endorse for mayor). These groups hardly form a single, unified movement, but if they're a big tent, Garcia was still outside it. She was against reducing the New York Police Department's budget , supported raising the cap on charter schools, and rejected calls to raise taxes on the wealthy. Garcia's focus on her own managerial skill almost recalled Michael Bloomberg, the consummate neoliberal politician. But there's a key difference: While Bloomberg preferred business to government and expressed his desire to make New York a \"luxury product ,\" Garcia is a creature of the public sector. She was reportedly beloved by her staff - a rare feat, since rank-and-file bureaucrats are often surprisingly progressive and often resent agency managers and electeds who maintain a complacent culture of mediocrity. (I say this from personal experience as an ex-bureaucrat.) Some of her more progressive proposals, including free childcare for low- and middle-income families and an extensive climate platform with a Green New Deal for public housing, would have required a significant expansion of New York City's fiscal authority and governmental capacity.\n\nNot only can good governance and public services jibe with leftist ideology, the two have gone together before. For 38 of the 50 years between 1910 and 1960, and under three separate mayors, Milwaukee was run by a democratic-socialist political faction nicknamed the \"Sewer Socialists.\" The first mayor, a woodworker named Emil Seidel, was swept into office on the Socialist Party line as a response to the deep corruption of the incumbent Democrats, and immediately got to work raising the minimum wage, strengthening the power of the civil service against patronage appointees, and laying the groundwork for what would become a nationally famous network of parks centered on the city's lakefront. His successors opened the first municipal public housing project in America, built libraries, pioneered adult vocational education, and required the city's private streetcar company to pave streets and run frequent service in exchange for its city-granted monopoly. As racist urban renewal schemes took hold in the 1950s, socialist mayor Frank Zeidler refused to participate in slum clearance unless integrated public housing was built for displaced residents.\n\nAs their nickname indicates, the Sewer Socialists' achievements were most famous in the realm of public health. Daniel Hoan, the second of their three mayors, ran public vaccination campaigns and built water-treatment plants around the city to end the longstanding practice of mixing raw sewage with drinking water. They instead recycled sewage sludge into fertilizer using a city-operated plant that continues operating today (you can take tours). The \"sewer\" moniker actually began as a way for more theoretically minded leftists to mock the Milwaukeeans' obsession with clean government and direct services, but they refashioned the term as a badge of pride. Seidel memorably dismissed their critics as \"Eastern smarties\" and wrote, \"We wanted a chance for every human being to be strong and live a life of happiness. And, we wanted everything that was necessary to give them that: playgrounds, parks, lakes, beaches, clean creeks and rivers, swimming and wading pools, social centers, reading rooms, clean fun, music, dance, song and joy for all.\"\n\nIf bureaucratic excellence and \"honest, frugal government\" seem like small ball compared to global socialist revolution, it's partly because U.S. cities face serious limits to their legal and political power. As Richard Schragger writes in his book City Power , cities are creations of their state governments with few rights of their own. They rarely have permission to raise and spend revenue as they see fit, must balance their budget every year, and are hobbled by the U.S.' lack of serious regional government structures. Partly because of these difficulties, the original Sewer Socialists were almost fanatical about their commitment to fiscal discipline. In 2021 most Americans would associate this attitude with austerity-loving conservatives, but there's another way to look at it: Every dollar in the municipal budget that's saved by rooting out inefficiency and graft is another dollar to be spent on better public services.\n\nWhat would running on Sewer Socialism look like in 2021? Start with (obviously) sanitation. New York's residential garbage collection is under the purview of the city's Sanitation Department (formerly run by Garcia), but commercial collection is handled by unaccountable, dangerous private companies that overwork and underpay their drivers. We know a unionized public agency can do the job better than the unregulated private sector, so let them take it over. There's also New Yorkers' infamous habit of leaving trash bags on the sidewalk, since the city doesn't have alleys. The obvious solution-replace some parking spaces on every block with rat-proof garbage containers-is currently being implemented, but the pilot program to do this makes applicants go through neighborhood groups or business improvement districts . The Sewer Socialist rejoinder: You shouldn't need an intermediary to get usable trash cans.\n\nSpeaking of parking spaces: The streets are a mess. Increased car ownership during COVID has led to more congested roads , reckless and unaccountable drivers , and the highest number of road deaths since 2014 . Sewer Socialists could run on a platform of managing the streets with separated bus and bike bus lanes in every corner of the city, for rich and poor alike. They could replace curb parking with loading zones to prevent double-parked delivery trucks, and implement a parking-permit system to raise revenue and stop rampant car-registration fraud. The result would be safer streets for the city's nondriving majority and proof that our public realm does not have to be chaotic and dystopian.\n\nEventually, any Sewer Socialist movement in New York will have to contend with the political and financial might of the police. Last summer, Bill de Blasio's impotent response to the NYPD's brutal treatment of anti-racist protestors confirmed the agency is effectively outside civilian control. Even if the \"Defund\" slogan is a nonstarter with the incoming mayor, there's a more utilitarian argument: The police are doing too many jobs they simply aren't good at. A new city pilot program to replace police with social workers for mental-health-related 911 calls has shown promising early results. Several elected officials have proposed getting the NYPD out of routine traffic stops, which would be a win for both street safety and racial justice. (There's strong public support for doing this , especially since police are famous for breaking the city's traffic laws with impunity.) Public attitudes on defunding or reforming the police are complex, and usually hinge on how the question is framed . But the worldview that Sewer Socialists champion, rooted in competence, anti-corruption, and democratic public life, provides a useful framing to understand why power and money need to be taken from the NYPD.\n\nBecause New York is a large, wealthy city with a vibrant progressive movement, there are more resources to make Sewer Socialism work here. (Likewise, when Milwaukee was run by socialists it was the 12th largest U.S. city and frequently annexed its suburbs .) Elsewhere the task might be harder, but the tradition still inspires. In Somerville, Massachusetts, DSA-backed candidates are running for City Council this September as \"sidewalk socialists,\" promising to invest in municipal plows to clear the sidewalks and provide union jobs during snowy Boston winters. On the same day that Eric Adams won in New York City, Buffalo, N.Y., picked socialist India Walton in its Democratic mayoral primary. In addition to running a dogged field operation, Walton heavily criticized incumbent Mayor Byron Brown's investments in overpolicing and big-ticket economic-development schemes instead of basic public services. In Jackson, Mississippi, 38-year-old Mayor Chokwe Lumumba began his first term in 2017 promising to both deliver high-quality services and pursue racial justice. Jackson is a poor, majority-Black city in a state run by white conservatives, and Lumumba has had trouble summoning the tax base he needs to fulfill his promises, but he won re-election in a landslide this spring.\n\nAll these struggles fit within a long history of Americans stripping cities for parts, hoarding the wealth in the suburbs, and then claiming urbanites can't govern themselves. That process has accelerated since the 1970s, as U.S. cities have embraced \" private sector-driven solutions to what we might normally think of as being in the realm of the state or public resources,\" in the words of historian Kim Phillips-Fein. New York has been at the forefront of this trend starting with the city's 1975 fiscal crisis \"emergency\" financial controls that are still in effect. And while progressive candidates' recent primary victories are partly a backlash to this neoliberal turn, it's noteworthy that these candidates also defeated allies of the city's Democratic machine. Eric Adams will be a machine mayor, one with strong working-class support and deep roots in the city's governing institutions. Offering a better vision will mean electing progressives with their own community roots who care about urban policy, but will also mean stacking the city bureaucracy with committed leftists and progressives who are inspired by the promise of public life and unafraid to speak up and act when their values and expertise are aligned.\n\nThe progressive left will have a hard time getting every item on its urban-governance wish list, because the rules of our political system conspire to make cities weak and underrepresented. American public-benefit programs at all levels of government are also designed so they're aggravating for citizens to access and hard for civil servants to implement well. Changing all of this is a necessary long-term project for the left. In the meantime, take it from Cea Weaver, the lefty housing organizer behind the coalition to pass New York State's historic tenants-rights package in 2019, who tweeted in May, \" I need the left to get someone like Kathryn Garcia.\" Delivering safe streets, joyful parks, affordable housing, and a livable planet will take the organizers in the streets and the nerds with the spreadsheets, working together.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Federalist Society Gets a Few Things Right. Liberals Should Take Note.\n\nThe end of Roe v. Wade was not a spontaneous coup. The decision instead represents the culmination of decades of organized struggle on the right, both within the law and outside of it. And while many groups contributed to the right's victory, one organization in particular has been thrust into the national spotlight due to the pivotal nature of its role: The Federalist Society.\n\nIn left-leaning political and legal circles, FedSoc is generally understood with a mix of disgust and envy. For the most part, however, disgust overwhelms envy: Liberals and leftists denounce FedSoc as a shadowy cabal wielding illegitimate and malign influence over our political system without considering what it has done well, why it succeeded while liberals were stuck on the back foot, and whether any part of FedSoc's model should be replicated from the left.\n\nThe key to understanding FedSoc's successes is to recognize that the conservative legal movement is barely a legal movement at all. Rather, it's a political organizing project hiding behind a thin legal veneer. The organization formed as a response to the independence of Republican-appointed justices who voted to end de jure racial segregation , strengthen constitutional protections for criminal defendants , and define the federal right to an abortion in Roe . From the start, FedSoc was designed to build a reactionary world. Its purpose was not to promote a particular theory of law, but instead to fight for political priorities like limited taxes on the wealthy, corporate impunity, resistance to any form of racial justice, the cultural values of the Christian right, and libertarian interest in select civil liberties (like white people carrying guns and corporate free speech during elections).\n\nFedSoc made its politics a reality through careful organizing. It focused on recruiting new law students and building strong social relationships among its membership, using tactics ranging from paying for the best food at lunch talks, to teaching its members how to run campus chapters , to having its most prominent members host cookouts to mix \"students and interns with prominent judges, clerks, attorneys and public officials.\" As a result, FedSoc didn't just recruit hard-right ideologues, it created them. Similarly, it coordinated its members through conferences, panels, and nepotistic hiring to allow them to push with organized fervor the legal theories that serve as a smokescreen for the movement's true purpose.\n\nElite liberal lawyers, on the other hand, are not capable of this type of explicit and intentional political organizing within the law. That's not to say individual liberal lawyers don't have their own politics-individual liberals tend to support LGBTQ rights, abortion, gun control, and more-but for liberal lawyers, such preferences are relegated to the narrow realm of legislative politics; something to write your congressperson about, not a litmus test for supporting a Supreme Court justice or even a reason to boycott a FedSoc event .\n\nTwo values fundamental to the liberal legal worldview subvert these lawyers' ability to engage in effective political organization: Blind reverence for personal brilliance and a latent belief in individualism.\n\nTo liberal lawyers, these values are as omnipresent and taken for granted as the air we breathe. On law school campuses, students who score well on exams are lauded as \"brilliant\" (not studious, or better yet, willing to tell professors what they want to hear). Upon leaving the academy the highest praise with which professors recommend students for employment are celebrations of intellect, resulting in an eyebrow-raising number of applicants described as \"smart as a whip,\" among other synonyms for \"very intelligent.\"\n\nRecently we saw the consequences of a politics of intelligence and individualism put in stark relief, as the profession's most public faces repeatedly embarrassed themselves at the moment FedSoc's project culminated in a supermajority of reactionaries on the Supreme Court. From professors Noah Feldman , Akhil Amar , and Amy Chua , to practitioners Lisa Blatt and Neal Katyal , prominent liberals cheered the appointments of each FedSoc Supreme Court nominee-while for the most part claiming to disagree very seriously with FedSoc's politics.  Professor Feldman told us: \"I disagree with [Barrett] on almost everything. But I still think she's brilliant.\" Katyal applauded Gorsuch's \"independence.\" Blatt put it most succinctly, saying of Kavanaugh: \"Sometimes a superstar is just a superstar.\"\n\nAn ideology whose north star is the independent exercise of personal brilliance will never be capable of fighting the reactionary right. The fetishization of intellect displaces moral and political values, leading liberals to act as if both left and right are always legitimate-as long as each position is argued with pizazz and wit. To them, it does not matter whether left is universal healthcare, civil rights, or police abolition and whether right is transphobia, melting the planet, or child slavery .\n\nSimilarly, hyper-individuality hamstrings liberals because it is a way of seeing the world fundamentally at odds with political organizing. If you believe that the independence of judges to use their personal brilliance should be elevated over almost all else, you will naturally bristle at organizations demanding accountability from judges- as liberals bristled at calls for Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to retire during the Obama years. As a result, rather than acknowledge something conservatives have done well-organize within the law-liberals attack the concept as illegitimate.\n\nTo fight against conservative retrenchment, the prevailing approach to law and politics needs to change and a leftwing political movement needs to make inroads in liberal legal institutions. Who better to learn from than the conservatives who have successfully done the same over the past generation?\n\nFedSoc's success was built on two pillars, both of which can and should be replicated by leftists trying to reorient the law. For one, conservatives centralized their organizing efforts within FedSoc. For another, conservatives fought to make their fringe ideas predominate within existing liberal institutions through aggressive recruitment and a willingness to fight from within rather than solely from the outside.\n\nLeftists can appropriate this dual strategy by centralizing organizing efforts through a single group (or at least fewer groups!), let's call it \"LeftSoc,\" and then by using that group to mold liberal institutions from within, both politically and tactically.\n\nFirst, a LeftSoc must build around a political vision. Over the past generation, the conservative legal movement's primary advantage over liberals has been that it offers a substantive vision for society. Yes, it is a vision rooted in reaction and repression, but it is a vision nonetheless. Liberal lawyers, on the other hand, believe that if you're smart, then you're qualified-politics be damned. It should go without saying that an effective counterpunch needs a vision too. And a substantive vision from the left should be rooted in the territory where it is strongest-that is, in democratic control of the state and economy and therefore in building power for poor and working people.\n\nSecond, a LeftSoc must focus on the nuts and bolts of relational organizing. Beyond its political vision, FedSoc's most compelling attribute is not its jejune theory of constitutional interpretation, but rather its understanding that legal and policy interventions are downstream from good organizing. That's why FedSoc invested in recruiting new law students and building strong social relationships among its membership. The left must do the same. Leftwing ideas for reform, from court packing to Medicare for All, are important endpoints, but learning how to achieve them is another matter entirely. The \"how\" is through organizing-building healthy and supportive networks that both recruit effectively and demand some level of accountability from members.\n\nThird, the left should consider the career trajectories of FedSoc neophytes. As former Justice Felix Frankfurter observed almost a hundred years ago, \"the law is what the lawyers are.\" But not all lawyers-only those in certain positions of influence, particularly within the state apparatus. Anecdotally, a major difference between law students with liberal politics and law students with politics further to the left is that the former pursue government \"insider\" roles while the latter pursue nonprofit \"outsider\" roles. For a left legal movement to exercise power, some of its members will need to overcome a natural aversion to these insider jobs. A LeftSoc could play a critical role in supporting its members so that leftists can change the jobs they enter and not, as is too often the case, allow the jobs to change them.\n\nFedSoc has made a beeline for the federal judiciary, recognizing it as the institution best equipped to implement an agenda of reaction-of enjoining people, groups, and governments from taking action. Because the left's goals are not to roll society back to 1789 (and because the inherently right-leaning Senate controls judicial appointments), but rather to build something new, equitable, and democratic, leftist energy should instead emphasize key agencies within the administrative state that can resist the judiciary .\n\nFourth, the left needs to develop shared scholarship and theory, much in the way the right unified around the idea of originalism. In developing a shared theory, however, the legal left must be careful not to confuse the purpose behind the effort: Legal theory is not about the search for the correct answer, because no such answer exists. The law is not like climate change, where rigorous and well-intentioned scientists can get together and tell us objectively that we are warming the planet. Rather, the law is socially constructed. Creating shared theoretical scholarship shifts the movement from one perceived as outsider or fringe to one that appears legitimate and within the established bounds of the profession. And to the extent the effort is successful, it will then create more favorable political terrain on which the left can fight.\n\nFinally, lawyers on the left should consider carefully how the conservative legal movement navigated relationships with other rightwing organizations. Lawyers and legal movements, whether on the right or the left, are but one piece of a much larger political struggle ; if events break poorly for your movement outside the law, your influence within the law may diminish too. Thus, just as FedSoc worked with big business and the Christian right to establish its Supreme Court supermajority, a LeftSoc would need alliances with organized labor, social movements, and community groups to advance our goals; just as FedSoc worked with and within a more moderate GOP, the left needs to leverage the sleeping giant that is the Democratic Party.\n\nThe effort to build and organize a fighting left within the law is already underway. Organizations like People's Parity Project are trying to create a leftwing pipeline to the federal judiciary. The Law and Political Economy Project is building legal theory for the left. The National Lawyers' Guild is doing the hard work of recruiting new law students to a shared political project. But with so many different organizations, their various projects happen somewhat parallel, sometimes with overlap, and occasionally in tension or competition with each other. As a small minority within the liberal institutions we must change, and an even smaller minority within the law as a whole, we cannot afford our efforts to be divided and uncoordinated.\n\nConservatives have a death grip on the Supreme Court, and by extension, much of the law that governs our lives. Until lawyers to the left of the political center learn to fight collectively for a better world, that grip will only grow tighter. Because, at the end of the day, no \"superstar\" is coming to save us.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "American Leftists Need to Pay More Attention to Rojava\n\nPhoto by John Moore/Getty Images\n\nThere is an astonishing story in Sunday's New York Times about Rojava , a Kurdish region in Northern Syria that's ruled by militant feminist anarchists. Rojava's constitution enshrines gender equality and religious freedom. An official tells journalist Wes Enzina that every position at every level of government includes a female equivalent of equal power. Recruits to Rojava's 6,000-strong police force receive their weapons only after two weeks of feminist instruction. Reading Enzina's piece, it's hard to understand how this radical experiment in democracy in one of the bloodiest corners of the world isn't better known internationally, particularly on the left.\n\nAt the start of piece, Enzina himself isn't quite sure Rojava is real. It sounds too fantastical:\n\nThe regime of President Bashar al-Assad doesn't officially recognize Rojava's autonomous status, nor does the United Nations or NATO - it is, in this way, just as illicit as the Islamic State. But if the reports I heard from the region were to be believed, within its borders the rules of the neighboring ISIS caliphate had been inverted. In accordance with a philosophy laid out by a leftist revolutionary named Abdullah Ocalan, Rojavan women had been championed as leaders, defense of the environment enshrined in law and radical direct democracy enacted in the streets.\n\nThe reports, Enzina eventually finds, are largely true. In Rojava's three Kurdish cantons, together comprising an area about the size of Connecticut, society is being organized according to the principles of an American anarchist-ecologist philosopher named Murray Bookchin. (Bookchin's most famous work is The Ecology of Freedom .) This unlikely turn of events springs from the ideological conversion of Abdullah Ocalan, the founder of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or P.K.K., which was once a Marxist Leninist terrorist group in Turkey-and in fact, the P.K.K. is still designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., the E.U., and NATO.* With America's help, Turkey captured Ocalan in 1999, and he was imprisoned alone-surrounded by over 1,000 soldiers-on an island near Istanbul. There he discovered Bookchin, who inspired a manifesto he issued in 2005. Enzina writes:\n\nThe manifesto called on all P.K.K. supporters to implement a version of Bookchin's ideas; Ocalan urged all guerrilla fighters to read ''The Ecology of Freedom.'' He instructed his followers to stop attacking the government and instead create municipal assemblies, which he called ''democracy without the state.'' These assemblies would form a grand confederation that would extend across all Kurdish regions of Syria, Iraq, Turkey and Iran and would be united by a common set of values based on defending the environment; respecting religious, political and cultural pluralism; and self-defense. He insisted that women be made equal leaders at all levels of society.\n\nIn Rojava, the Kurds, under the government of a P.K.K. affiliate, are following Ocalan's directive. More amazing still, Rojava's militias, the Y.P.G., or People's Protection Units, and the all-female Y.P.J., or Female Protection Units, are successfully taking on ISIS . The New York Review of Books has just published a story by Jonathan Steele about their military successes, titled \"The Syrian Kurds Are Winning!\" In January, with the aid of U.S. airpower, the Y.P.G. drove ISIS out of Kobani, a town on the Turkish-Syrian border. In July, again with American help, the Kurds rousted ISIS from another border town, Tal Abyad. \"This meant ISIS had lost two of the three crossing points from Turkey through which it could bring foreign volunteers, finance, and weaponry to strengthen the jihad,\" Steele writes.\n\nGiven this, how has Rojava remained relatively obscure? Some have certainly tried to raise awareness: Over a year ago David Graeber, a major figure in Occupy Wall Street, published a piece in the Guardian titled \"Why is the world ignoring the revolutionary Kurds in Iraq?\" He compared the hellish conflict in Syria to the Spanish Civil War, where leftists from around the world went to fight fascism. \"If there is a parallel today to Franco's superficially devout, murderous Falangists, who would it be but Isis? If there is a parallel to the Mujeres Libres of Spain, who could it be but the courageous women defending the barricades in Kobane? Is the world-and this time most scandalously of all, the international left-really going to be complicit in letting history repeat itself?\"\n\nIf calls like this aren't resonating, I suspect it's because similar ones were made in the run-up to the Iraq war. Over the years, it has become hard to imagine why more than a few prominent progressives either supported that war or opposed it only ambivalently. But at the time, several Iraqi leftists- most notably Kanan Makiya -pleaded with their ideological allies in America not to oppose the overthrow of the fascist Saddam Hussein, however compromised George W. Bush's motives were. I remember appeals to the memory of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, the American leftists who fought Franco in Spain. The memory of Bosnia was still fresh, and at least some progressives believed that Western military force could be a force for good.\n\nVery few on the left believe that anymore. The Iraq war not only destroyed Iraq, destabilized the Middle East, and led to the rise of ISIS; it also destroyed Western faith that much can be done to help the people who are now struggling to stop ISIS's spread. Maybe part of the reason Americans haven't heard more about Rojava is because we don't want to. We're ashamed at having unleashed the horror that besieges them, and ashamed that we have no idea how to help them stop it without making things even worse. Writing in Dissent about international apathy towards Rojava, Meredith Tax asks , \"Are we in the United States too cynical or depressed to believe anything new can happen? Are we able to recognize revolutionary ideas when they come from Greece, Spain, or Latin America but not from the Middle East?\"\n\nYet aiding the revolutionaries of Rojava needn't be framed purely as a question of American intervention. Tax writes:\n\nI recently spoke to someone from the Kurdish women's movement in Rojava and asked what they need most. She said they need a massive international solidarity campaign, beginning with political education about the evolution of the PKK and its politics, including its emphasis on democratic governance, anti-sectarianism, secularism, ecology, and women's liberation. In practical terms, they need all possible international pressure to be put on Turkey and the KRG to end the embargo and let supplies through. They need the terrorist designation to be lifted so they can travel and raise money and do public speaking.\n\nThat doesn't seem like too much to ask for the feminists dying for America's foreign policy sins.\n\n*Update, Nov. 29, 2015, 9:20 p.m.: This post has been updated to clarify that the P.K.K. is still designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., the E.U., and NATO.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Why Is San Francisco So Liberal?\n\nPhotograph by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.\n\nPresident Obama rejected the Keystone XL pipeline application on Wednesday. It would have connected the Canadian oil sands to the Gulf coast in Texas. Newt Gingrich called the decision \"stupid\" and said it was made to please \" left-wing extremists sitting in San Francisco .\" Why is San Francisco so liberal?\n\nIt began with sailors and booze. As a former mining boomtown and a bustling port, San Francisco has always been slightly more permissive than the average American metropolis. Sailors loved to visit the city's bars and bawdy houses in the late 1800s and early 1900s. But San Francisco's national reputation for liberalism and libertinism really got going after Prohibition ended in 1933. California was one of the few states that did not establish an alcoholic beverage control board, which meant there was little regulation of bars and nightclubs. San Francisco, with its large population of Irish and German Catholics, tended to be more lax about drinking than cities farther south, where Protestants were more common and there was a strong, permanent military presence. The local government was also weak by comparison and largely controlled by labor unions with little interest in suppressing the burgeoning bar scene. The \"Bohemian clubs\" around the city's North Beach neighborhood became gathering places for marginalized groups-communists, anarchists, homosexuals, and African-Americans, among others-and word spread that the city was safe for freethinkers and other black sheep.\n\nWhen World War II broke out, San Francisco was the last stop for many sailors before shipping out to the Pacific theater, and these men, too, took advantage of the city's looser moral code. The city's reputation for permissiveness snowballed after the war. Returning soldiers who fondly recalled their wild days and nights by the Bay made it their permanent home, and others seeking a freer set of morals joined them. Population surged 22 percent during the 1940s. Influential San Franciscans began to trumpet the city's openness to all people and all lifestyles, and newspaper columnist Herb Caen labeled the exotic city \" Baghdad by the Bay .\"\n\nWhile San Francisco became known for its laissez-faire style, the influx of freethinkers eventually pushed the limits. The Catholic old guard began to resist public expressions of sexuality, tolerance of illicit drugs, and un-American political views. The conflict brought national attention to the city as a battleground for traditional values. Police arrested Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Shigeyoshi Murao for obscenity in 1957 after they sold Allen Ginsberg's Howl . (The two were exonerated at trial.) After mass student protests in favor of free speech , gubernatorial candidate Ronald Reagan campaigned on a promise to \"clean up the mess in Berkeley.\" The 1967 Summer of Love , with its \" free store \" and even freer morals, angered many longtime residents. San Francisco was the home base of gay rights advocates who halted Anita Bryant's anti-homosexuality campaign .\n\nWhile San Francisco has been considered socially liberal for the better part of a century, it didn't become political shorthand for extreme leftism until the mid-1980s. At the 1984 Republican National Convention, Ronald Reagan's ambassador to the United Nations, Democrat Jeane Kirkpatrick, accused \" San Francisco Democrats \" of weakening the country's foreign policy and constantly blaming the United States for the success of Central American leftists. Bill O'Reilly and others picked up on the theme, summing up left-wing ideology as \"San Francisco values.\"\n\nGot a question about today's news?

      "text": "Venezuela's Other Socialists\n\nVenezuelan \"socialism,\" for those outside the country, conjures up images of empty supermarkets, a starving population, and hyperinflation. And there's some truth to the image. Venezuela has fallen spectacularly from being the richest nation in Latin America into an unprecedented economic crisis that has seen millions flee the country. This collapse comes during the self-proclaimed \"socialist\" revolution spearheaded by Hugo Chávez two decades ago and continued by current President Nicolás Maduro. There is, however, more to the story.\n\nPerhaps no one knows this better than the country's other socialists-those on the left who are not part of the ruling party, the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), nor pro-government.\n\nThe left in Venezuela has many different movements and organizations, identifying as communist, Trotskyist, Marxist-Leninist, and various other related groups. A significant portion of them fiercely oppose the government. Some believe Chávez's revolution was a farce, \"socialism by name but capitalism in practice,\" as René Cedillo of the Marxist-Leninist organization Bandera Roja (Red Flag) puts it. And there are those willing to go to great lengths-including putting their ideology to one side-to see the regime fall. While foreign coverage of the country often reduces its political divide to a socialist government putting down a pro-capitalist opposition, the truth is that there are red flags on both sides of the barricades.\n\n\"Venezuela is an interesting case study in left-right politics,\" Geoff Ramsey, the Washington Office on Latin America's assistant director for Venezuela, told me. \"Even though [U.S. President Donald] Trump paints the crisis as a battle against socialism, most of the major opposition parties are Socialist International members, and espouse social democratic platforms.\"\n\nNevertheless, for political groups to declare themselves full-fledged socialists has become taboo as a result of the regime, according to Ramsey and other analysts, meaning these represent a smaller slice of the opposition. \"While they may support social democratic policies, Chavismo has made it difficult for any major opposition party to identify as socialist in Venezuela.\"\n\nOne that does is Bandera Roja, a political organization that began as a guerrilla movement in the 1970s. Bandera Roja never believed in Chávez-nor that he was a socialist.\n\n\"We said Chávez was going to be a fraud\" before he was first elected in 1998, says Cedillo. \"Unfortunately for the country, history proved us right.\"\n\nAt the time, Bandera Roja had accused Chávez of being too centrist in his politics and of potentially perpetuating old neoliberal policies, while rejecting a dialogue with their party.\n\nOther socialists were not as quick to disavow Chávez. Even before coming to power, Chávez began uniting left-wing parties and organizations on his revolutionary platform, and continued to do so once in office. Many were unified under the PSUV in 2007. But eventually, some of these groups grew disillusioned with the movement and peeled off.\n\nZuleika Matamoros is a teacher and a member of the Marea Socialista, a left-wing political organization that was part of the PSUV until 2014.\n\n\"Even though we supported [Chávez's government], we didn't consider it to be a socialist government,\" Matamoros says. She explains that even during his first presidential bid, Chávez was not campaigning on explicitly socialist policies.\n\nHer organization, like others, respected Chávez's popular revolution and hoped to eventually see it transform into a true socialist movement. But to the Marea Socialista's frustration this did not happen, and it saw the PSUV become increasingly totalitarian and begin to descend into bureaucratic infighting. Now, it is in staunch opposition to the government.\n\n\"We're the resistance to a process that was destroyed from within,\" Matamoros says.\n\nOthers on the left, like union and teachers' rights committee representative Dario Gómez, turned their backs on Chávez when his actions began contradicting his outward condemnation of \"imperialism\" (a socialist trope used frequently by Chavistas, or supporters of Chávez's movement). Gómez's breaking point was seeing Chávez let foreign multinationals continue to partake in the oil boom through a 2001 law. Chávez later expropriated large parts of the oil sector.\n\nMany accuse Chávez of simply switching one set of \"imperialist\" chains for others as he courted support from other U.S. rivals. \"We escaped our submission to the United States over 40 years [preceding Chávez], to submit ourselves to the imperialisms of China and Russia,\" Cedillo says.\n\nThose two nations have given Venezuela billions of dollars in unrepaid loans and have struck numerous business deals with the country.\n\nPerhaps the deepest critique of the government by opposition leftists is its failure to protect Venezuela's workforce-a cornerstone of socialist ideology-while violently suppressing public protests. The wages that state employees including teachers, police officers, and medics get per month can literally only buy a few items of food. At the time of writing, minimum wage had recently been increased-again-by nearly 300 percent, for a total of less than $5 a month.\n\nMany Venezuelan leftists place the blame for this squarely at Maduro's feet, especially after a 2018 memorandum that they claim reduced real salaries and violated workers' rights.\n\nSome have branded the government's economic policies as capitalist, even \"neoliberal,\" as Cedillo puts it.\n\n\"The social sector or class that has most benefited from these 20 years of the Chavista regime is the financial oligarchy, the banking and imports sectors,\" says Cedillo.\n\nRamsey believes there is some truth to this if corruption is taken into account. \"There's no question that Chavez was good for an unscrupulous few in the imports and financial sectors. The currency controls that began under Chavez contributed to widespread corruption,\" he wrote in an email.\n\nThis fiery backlash against the government's \"fraudulent\" socialism may come as a surprise. Especially given that many international observers-including Trump-have blamed Venezuela's collapse on socialist economic policies and used them to criticize leftists elsewhere.\n\n\"The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented,\" Trump announced at the 2017 U.N. General Assembly.\n\nIt's true that Chavismo put in place several socialist-style reforms, such as the nationalization of big industries and a huge rise in social spending. However, this was accompanied by catastrophic mismanagement , overspending, corruption, and risky economic policies. Merely blaming the country's current state on socialism doesn't give the full picture.\n\nConservatives aren't the only ones who oversimplify the situation. Oswaldo Pacheco, of the Trotskyist organization Socialism and Freedom Party (PSL), is unhappy about how the international left conflates socialism with Chavismo. \"To the world ... the left [in Venezuela] is Maduro and Chávez ... they can't put us all in the same basket,\" he says. Pacheco believes that some organizations on the left continue to support atrocities happening in Venezuela in the interest of protecting their cause.\n\n\"Their pretext is that if Maduro falls, the right will take power. ... It's perverse,\" he says. \"That is to say, don't resist [the regime] because there's no chance of offering a better option than Chavismo, than Madurismo.\"\n\nEven within Venezuela, the left cannot escape the stigma of Chávez's shadow.\n\n\"Chavismo practically ruined socialism,\" Gómez says.\n\nSo, what can Venezuela's other socialists do to turn the tide? The left, like much of Venezuela's opposition, is far from unified on the way forward. Many want to see Maduro out of office, even if it means putting their agenda on standby. \"We're not proposing socialism at this moment in time. We are proposing a national reconstruction,\" says Cedillo. Should Maduro fall, getting the country back on track would be their priority; and they would wait for new elections to put forward their ideology.\n\nGómez and others say some on the left have sided with the political opposition fronted by Juan Guaidó, a politician who declared himself (interim) president at the start of 2019. Other leftist movements are unwilling to trust Guaidó over Maduro-Venezuela's patchwork opposition parties are often labeled as right-wing (even though there are several left-leaning parties in the elected opposition and even Guaidó's party is a member of the organization Socialist International), and they're friendly with the United States. Better the devil you know.\n\nGómez is instead calling for milder changes, like a livable salary.\n\nMatamoros' movement, Marea Socialista, thinks neither Maduro nor Guaidó will ever be enough (\"They're all right-wing, regardless of what they say\"); it wants a government run by workers for the workers. \"It's not just a change of government [we need] ... there has to be a deep political change,\" Matamoros says. \"We have to form another revolution.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Are Out-of-Touch Twitter Leftists Controlling the Democratic Primary? (No.)\n\nA new idea has taken hold in certain parts of the Democratic Party and the political press. Here's an anonymous Joe Biden ally quoted approvingly in a Politico article by Ryan Lizza last week:\n\nThe well-known Democrat said of the Biden press corps, \"They view this party as dominated by woke millennials and through the lens of coastal issues. They are products, increasingly, of fairly elite schools and they don't talk to a lot of voters who don't look and talk like them.\" ... They are, this person argued, obsessed with a Democratic Party that exists only on Twitter. She pointedly noted that there are Democrats \"outside of those 18,000 voters in Queens,\" referring to the total vote share-it was actually closer to 17,000 -for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in her June 2018 primary victory.\n\nAnd here's New York magazine's Jonathan Chait on Friday :\n\nHere is a science-fiction scenario: Imagine a strange new virus that incapacitates everybody below the age of 75 ... The virus is Twitter ... The field was racing left, treating the consensus on progressive Twitter as though it were a simulacrum of the real Democratic Party ... [Kirsten Gillibrand's campaign] seemed to be positioning the candidate to be elected President of Twitter ... [Kamala Harris and Cory Booker] devoted most of the time between their launch and the Iowa caucuses trying to avoid getting dragged on Twitter ... Biden's lack of awareness of Twitter may be to his benefit.\n\nAnd here's the Atlantic's George Packer, quoting Colorado Sen. Michael Bennett approvingly on Monday :\n\n\"The Twitter universe has decided that Medicare for All is what we are about, and the Green New Deal,\" he said. \"The Twitter base of the Democratic Party decides what's important, not the actual base. The actual base of the Democratic Party are a bunch of people that have never, ever, ever engaged with a politician on Twitter. They are the people we met with today [at an Iowa preschool] who are teaching school. Those women are invisible to cable television. The children that are in that school are invisible to cable television, and invisible to the Twitter universe.\"\n\nTwitter leftism-what's its deal? How did it zombie-brainwash both Democratic primary candidates and the reporters covering them into thinking that Democratic voters have become full-on Che Guevara T-shirt radicals when in fact they're still humble, technologically illiterate peasants who believe in the modest middle-way politics espoused by salt-of-the-earth, finger-on-the-pulse average Joes like Rahm Emanuel ?\n\nThe truth, in fact, is that this did not happen. And to understand the extent to which it has not happened, you can start by looking at the polls in Iowa and New Hampshire, the states in which voters have the best opportunity to make judgments about whom to support based on familiarity rather than ambient national media buzz. Averaging together the RealClearPolitics aggregates from those states, here's what you get:\n\n• Joe Biden, 26 percent • Bernie Sanders, 20 percent • Elizabeth Warren, 19 percent • Pete Buttigieg, 8 percent • Kamala Harris, 8 percent\n\nSupport for the avowedly-more-centrist candidates, Biden and Buttigieg, totals 34 percent, while support for the more progressive candidates, Sanders and Warren, totals 39 percent. (Harris, it's true, embraces some positions that appeal to the activist left, like impeaching Justice Brett Kavanaugh , but those aren't exclusively ideological and also appeal to more moderate but highly partisan Dems. And for what it's worth, Buttigieg has been the subject of many more \"wow, this guy is an impressive candidate who's going places\" pieces written by fancy-pants big-city political journalists during this cycle than Sanders.) In Iowa and New Hampshire, states that are generally not thought of as being dominated by snobby elites, slightly more rank-and-file Democrats currently support Sanders and Warren than the major candidates who are not woke communists.\n\nMeanwhile, Gillibrand-the candidate who, as Chait says, seems to have pandered hardest to hardcore social media users-is polling at 0 in these states, because her campaign was a flop and she dropped out. He suggests that this demonstrates the folly of playing to the Twitter crowd. Maybe so! But then why are the other progressives, who are also supposedly captured by Twitter, still going strong? Perhaps there's something more substantive going on with the successful progressive candidates than their mere appeal to shouty online types.\n\nIf you break down Sanders' and Warren's support in national polls, it becomes clear that this is true and that their \"bases\" comprise normal humans in addition to internet humans. Sanders does very well with voters who have lower incomes, relatively little education, and relatively little interest in following political news on a day-to-day basis; he's also strong this time around with black voters as a whole and, at least at one point, led Biden among Latino voters. Warren, meanwhile, is disproportionately popular with women and older people-if you sort polling results by age and gender at the same time, you find that she's strongest with women 55 and older, confirming on-the-ground reporting that has suggested that many of her core supporters are women who also supported and identified with Hillary Clinton . If several of the female preschool staffers cited in the Atlantic/Packer article above don't end up voting for Warren, I will eat Green Eggs and Ham . (And contra Bennett/Packer's claim that the these women are tragically offline and invisible, one of the individuals named in the piece has a Twitter account that has \"liked\" Democratic politicians' tweets in the past, while another has testified at a congressional \"field hearing.\" )\n\nTo believe that young, affluent, well-educated, disproportionately white journalists and social media users are influencing the primary to a potentially catastrophic degree, you have to believe that they're doing so in large part by exerting that influence over the voters who are most different from them demographically-and, in the case of Clinton/Warren supporters, the voters who supported the candidate whom internet hipsters didn't like during the last cycle.\n\nThere's a simpler explanation, though, which is that Sanders and Warren are proposing, for the most part, ideas that have significant actual support among ordinary Democrats. Even the polling Chait himself cites to show that single-payer \"Medicare for All\" is an electoral liability says that 64 percent of Democrats support the idea; an even more recent survey , by the Kaiser Family Foundation, found that 76 percent of Democrats and 52 percent of Americans as a whole have a favorable view of single payer. The point, which is often elided by those making the case for centrism, is that while a \"public option\" approach is more popular than single payer because it wouldn't eliminate private insurance, the concept of single payer is also popular , especially among Democrats. (Barack Obama, who remains the most popular Democrat and pundits' walking definition of the party's mainstream, praised \"Medicare for All\" in a 2018 speech , during which he also made approving mention of \"debt-free college\" proposals, which several progressive-wing candidates-but not \"responsible\" centrists like Biden and Amy Klobuchar-have backed during this cycle.)\n\nThis broad willingness to consider progressive ideas also shows up when you consider voters' second-choice candidates : A plurality of Biden supporters likes Sanders next-best, and a plurality of Buttigieg supporters feels the same way about Warren. If anything, the evidence in the polls suggests that primary voters are punishing the kinds of candidates who get left-activist buzz: General-election \"electability\" continues to be the trait that Dems say they are looking for most in a candidate, and Biden-the anti-Twitter candidate, according to all three articles above-is the one they think is the most electable. When one group of pollsters conducted a survey in which they explicitly told respondents not to consider electability, Biden's advantage disappeared .\n\nWhatever the ultimate outcome of the primary, there is an verifiably large group of people in the \"real Democratic party\"-numbering in the tens of millions, and composed of many types of people besides grad school SJW twentysomethings-who are willing to support a strong progressive platform. So what explains Lizza, Chait, and Packer's belief that such views could only be held by sworn members of the Twitter PC police? Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that they all come from a centrist D.C./New York intellectual tradition-neoliberal on domestic policy, neoconservative on foreign policy, \"classically liberal\" on issues of speech and civics-that is , in fact, involved in an extended existential battle with hardcore socialists, who often target Lizza, Chait, and Packer in particular for derision. When you're persistently inundated online by people with rose DSA icons calling you names like \"binch\" and \"corncob,\" it's understandable that they might start to drive you crazy and take on disproportionate explanatory power in your imagination. But that's why you've just got to get out of your bubble sometimes.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Red and the Brown\n\nOn Aug. 23, 1939, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union and the Third Reich secretly met in Moscow to sign a treaty of non-aggression. The infamous \"red-brown pact\" paved the way for the Nazis' conquest of large swathes of central Europe. It also caused a deep crisis of conscience for activists, including my grandparents, who had been attracted to communism in part because of its promises to free the world from sectarianism and racial injustice.\n\nIn the end, most communists found some way of reconciling their conscience with the unconscionable. They invoked strategy or necessity, the evil of bourgeois capitalism or the wisdom of Joseph Stalin (or denied the existence of the pact altogether). In one way or the other, they contrived to recover the certitude that they were on the side of the angels-and that this could, at times, justify an alliance with the devil.\n\nInternational politics is always ripe for strange partnerships, of course. How else to explain that Iran is allied with North Korea, or indeed that the United States supports the governments of Egypt and Saudi Arabia? And yet, something about the seismic shifts now transforming the ideological spectrum of Western democracies goes beyond these partnerships of convenience. Both left-wing and right-wing enemies of liberal democracy are smelling blood in the water-and they are not too picky about the people with whom they are to share the feast.\n\nAll around the world, left-wing and right-wing populists are finding it surprisingly easy to make common cause: In Greece, far-left Syriza ascended to government power in a coalition with far-right ANEL. In many European countries, the Kremlin is simultaneously supporting populist insurgents on both sides of the political spectrum. In much of the West, both the radical right and the anti-imperialist left close their eyes to the war crimes of Syria's Bashar al-Assad. Meanwhile, in the United States, a growing number of leftists are disdainful of the idea that Donald Trump might represent a special danger; America, they say, is so deeply rotten that it's naïve to think of Trump as a departure from the past, or to fear that there's anything of value left to defend.\n\nBut nothing has brought today's bizarre, postmodern variation on the red-brown alliance into focus quite as sharply as the recent news that Italy's amorphous Five Star Movement is trying to build a coalition government with the deeply xenophobic League.\n\nThe mayors of the League have, for years, been in the ugly habit of ramping up deportations around the end of the year under the slogan of \"White Christmas.\" When a former member of the party went on a shooting rampage in the southern city of Macerata at the beginning of this year-seriously injuring six African immigrants-Matteo Salvini, the party's leader, pointedly refused to condemn him. In an age in which the term \"white supremacy\" is at times applied rather indiscriminately, there can be little doubt that it applies to Salvini's men.\n\nThe Five Star Movement, by contrast, clearly started on the political left. Though Beppe Grillo has at times pronounced the old ideological distinctions to be dead, he rose to political prominence by assailing Silvio Berlusconi (a right-wing populist who has cultivated as many dubious ties as Michael Cohen, yet was politically rather more moderate than Donald Trump). It derives its name from five early demands, all of which fit comfortably on the left side of the political spectrum: Control over local water supply should stay in public hands; the government should do much more to protect the environment; every town should provide its citizens with free access to the internet; Italy should favor bikes, buses, and trains over cars; and it should embark on a sustainable model of economic development inspired by the concept of \"de-growth.\"\n\nAnd yet, this populist movement with its justified anger at a corrupt political leader and its hodgepodge list of idealistic demands has, with breathtaking rapidity, gone sour. Over the years, its representatives started to insinuate that 9/11 might have been an inside job, built ever-closer ties with the Kremlin, and took increasingly noxious stances on immigration.\n\nThat transformation is now nearing its completion: Faced with a choice between new elections, a joint government with the center-left Democratic Party, or a pact with the racists of Salvini's League, the leaders of the Five Star Movement have opted for a left-right populist alliance. Early media reports make clear what the new government's first order of business is likely to be if it really does come together: a crackdown on immigrants. Political logic also dictates a second undertaking: Unable to agree on much of a positive program, they will likely use their shared hostility to the European Union as a glue that can help keep their fractious coalition together.\n\nThis should serve as a timely warning to all those who believe that only right-wing populism is truly dangerous, and therefore regard the rise of left-wing populism as a benign correction to the failings of liberal democracy. In The Populist Explosion, for example, John Judis argued that right-wing populism is likely to lead to violence and injustice because it is \"triadic\": Populist leaders like Donald Trump claim to channel the voice of ordinary people in the fight against both elites and vulnerable minorities, from Muslims to black Americans. Left-wing populism, by contrast, is unlikely to instigate the same devastation because it is \"dyadic\": Fully focused on the conflict between ordinary people and political elites, it does not scapegoat outsiders. Therefore, it isn't likely to compound existing injustices.\n\nBut this overlooks that ideology is not the most defining characteristic of the populists. As I argue in The People vs. Democracy , what truly defines them is a political style that combines a fixation on odious villains and simple solutions with a deep disdain for the existing institutions of representative democracy. That helps to explain why left-wing populists might sound very different from right-wing populists in the early stages, when they are far from power, but are likely to resemble them more and more as they mature.\n\nSince a noble attraction to assailing the baddies can easily turn into a reckless addiction to casting everybody as an enemy, their hatred of politicians and corporations can easily transfer to migrants and minorities. And since they believe their enemy's enemy to be their friend, they will always be tempted to cheer the rise of right-wing populists-and even to make common cause with them when they can't govern on their own. In the language of Judis, the Five Star Movement may, like Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and other leftist dictatorships, have started as a dyadic movement-but the ease and speed with which it acquired a third, and deeply xenophobic, axis makes that distinction feel rather arcane.\n\nHistorical comparisons nearly always contain fewer analogies than disanalogies. This is doubly true for those, like the red-brown pact, that reach back to the most bitter episodes of human history. Thankfully, neither Grillo nor Salvini are likely to attain the historical importance of Molotov and Ribbentrop. And yet, we should not take too much comfort in Karl Marx's famous quip that when history repeats itself, what was once tragedy is miraculously transmuted into farce.\n\nFor all the many differences between the present moment and the past, the 20 th century has given us plenty of bitter opportunities that showcase what happens when parts of the left grow so hostile to liberal democracy that they become willing to make common cause with the far right. And even if the results should turn out a little more farcical and a tad less tragic this time around, they would still be likely to visit unspeakable cruelty and suffering upon the world.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe long, forgotten history of pro-gun left-wing groups.\n\nby Kim Kelly\n\nRight-wingers have held an unearned monopoly on gun culture for too long. Whether it's in the halls of legislative power or in the comments under \"gun bunny\" photos on Instagram , there is a prevailing narrative that pegs guns and armed self-defense exclusively to Republicans, racist libertarians, and other generally Constitution-obsessed weirdos. It maintains that those on the left want to take away everyone's guns and swathe the entire country in bubble wrap. But I'm an anarchist , and I call bullshit.\n\nI'm of the firm opinion that it's time to not only arm the left but challenge the narrative that all leftists are anti-gun. Many are, and that's a position I can understand and respect. But there is also a long history of armed community self-defense among the radical left that is often glossed over or forgotten entirely in favor of the Fox News-friendly narrative that all liberals hate guns. That's simply not the case - though as history has proven, the only thing that scares the reactionary right more than the idea of losing their guns is the thought of us having them.\n\nI grew up with guns , and my familiarity with them is a big part of why l view things the way I do. My family hunts for sustenance, and gun safety was taught to me before I was tall enough to see over my dad's workbench. I can understand why people who weren't raised around them would view firearms with fear and loathing, but for me, a gun in the hands of someone I trust is a comforting sight, because I know the power it holds.\n\nWhen I was in Charlottesville, Virginia, protesting the Unite the Right rally in 2017, the only time I truly felt safe was when members of Redneck Revolt - a working-class, anti-fascist, anti-racist armed community defense group - showed up open-carrying and secured the park where a number of us were gathered. The police may have stood by and done nothing as a neo-Nazi murdered one of us, but Redneck Revolt was there to offer protection - and the fascists steered clear of that park because of it.\n\nIn Stone Mountain, Georgia, when a group of us marched through the streets to celebrate the cancellation of a Klan rally on February 2 , we were accompanied by local activists with rifles and ARs slung over their shoulders; the police kept their distance, which was an extraordinary sight for someone used to New York City's ultra-aggressive, hyper-militarized NYPD. As the black militant liberation group the Black Panthers showed back in the 1960s, as the Zapatistas showed in the '90s, and as anarchists in New Orleans showed during the aftermath of Katrina , when cops and other fascists see that they're not the only ones packing, the balance of power shifts, and they tend to reconsider their tactics.\n\nTo be honest, the thought of a world in which the state and their running dogs are the only entities with access to firearms sends a shudder down my spine.\n\nNot everyone should have access to guns - domestic abusers, for example, have proven by their actions that they cannot be trusted with that kind of responsibility - and not everyone needs it. No one without a significant amount of training should be handling a firearm at all, which is why I think designated community patrols made up of well-trained, highly trusted individuals who are chosen by and held accountable to said community (and who do not hold any or less power than anyone else due to their position) is a far better and more equitable defense model than messy \"everyone gets a gun!\" rhetoric.\n\nI'm also not interested in creating a parallel cultural universe wherein balaclava-clad \"gun bunnies\" pose for the 'gram (I'd much rather shore up support for Rojava's all-women YPG Women's Defense Unit ). I'm interested in reclaiming the notion of armed self-defense from those who have long used it as a cudgel to repress dissent and terrorize marginalized communities, and emphasizing its potential as a transformative tool toward collective liberation.\n\nThere is a long history of leftist gun ownership, and a concurrent theme of state repression against it. As author and anarchist scott crow notes , \"our current gun control laws disproportionately hobble poor communities and communities of color.\" As far as the state is concerned, black people were never meant to own guns at all; the Second Amendment was intended in part as a means of controlling the enslaved black population and suppressing possible uprisings.\n\nThat sentiment has proven to have quite a bit of staying power. In 1967 , the Black Panthers staged an armed demonstration on the steps of the California state courthouse and launched an occupation in protest of the Mulford Act, which banned open carry in the state. Said law was written by a Republican Assembly member in response to the Panthers' cop-watching \" police patrols\" ; shortly after the protest, state legislators rushed to enact tougher gun control laws, with the full support of Republican President Ronald Reagan and the National Rifle Association.\n\nIn a stark contrast to its current bloodthirsty propagandizing, the NRA was once a firm proponent of gun control, and was a key component of the passage of 1934's National Firearms Act , which imposed restrictions on machine guns. That began to change in the 1960s; the NRA continued to support gun control, but its members - who had begun buying guns more for protection than for hunting - started to protest. The shift crystallized in 1977 with the ascent of Harlon Carter, a former immigration agent who'd killed a Mexican teenager in his youth and went on to shape what still fraudulently insists on referring to itself as \"the oldest civil rights organization in the country\" in his racist image.\n\nNow the NRA's insistence that it fights for the civil rights of legal gun owners rings hollow. Lest we forget, Philando Castile - a legal gun owner - was still killed by cops, inches from his partner and child. He'd informed them that he was carrying, and it proved to be a death sentence.\n\nWith that, as well as the endless extrajudicial killings of black people by cops in this country in mind, some may wonder how anyone can responsibly suggest that more guns are the answer. I defer to the work of groups like the Huey P. Newton Gun Club , the now-defunct Black Women's Defense League (who approached the issue through a black feminist lens), and Denver's Brothas Against Racist Cops (BARC) , who frame gun ownership as a civil rights issue and emphasize the need to protect their communities from those who wish them harm. As BWDL organizer Niecee X told Vice in 2017, \"At the end of the day, we have a common goal, and that common goal is ultimately liberation, but at the very least the well-being and safety of our sisters.\"\n\nMarginalized communities know best how to keep themselves safe; depending on law enforcement to protect them from racist and fascist attacks is a losing strategy (especially considering how often that particular call is coming from inside the house ). \"The problem is guns, bullets come from guns,\" BARC founder Eric Randall told the Guardian in 2016. \"But the main problem is who is holding the damn gun. No one had a problem with people killing us until we started arming ourselves.\"\n\nI don't have all the answers, but the bare fact of the matter here is that violent right-wing extremism is a continuing threat that has been allowed to spread unabated in this country - a country that is itself rooted in the oppression of people of color. The police will not protect us; neither will the military, or well-meaning liberals, or your favorite oh-so-progressive politicians . It is not in their interest to do so, and recognizing that is imperative to the survival of those who reject this vile status quo.\n\nThe way that leftists engage with the subject of firearms, conflict, and power within our own communities needs to shift toward a place where guns are considered just another tool in our struggle for collective liberation, not the sole focus. Until we live in a world with no police, no military, and no state, we're at the mercy of all three - and I, at least, don't think it's fair to expect us to confront them empty-handed.\n\nKim Kelly is a freelance writer and labor organizer whose writing on labor, politics, and culture has appeared in the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Guardian, the New Republic, Teen Vogue, the Pacific Standard, and many other publications.\n\nFirst Person is Vox's home for compelling, provocative narrative essays.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIt's not just a weird libertarian obsession. Corporate AI is already warping our lives and our governments.\n\nby Dylan Matthews\n\nI spend a disproportionate amount of time reading and talking to two somewhat niche groups of people in American politics: democratic socialists of the Sen. Bernie Sanders variety (or maybe a bit to the left of that), and left-libertarians from the Bay Area who are interested in effective altruism .\n\nThese are both small groups, but they have social and intellectual influence bigger than their numbers. And while from a distance they look similar (I'm sure they both vote for Democrats in general elections, say), there's a big issue on which they part ways where collaboration could be productive: artificial intelligence safety.\n\nEffective altruists have, for complex sociological reasons I explored in a podcast episode , become very interested in AI as a potential \"existential risk\" : a force that could, in extreme circumstances, wipe out humanity, just as nuclear war or asteroid strikes could.\n\nKelsey Piper has a comprehensive Vox explainer of these arguments, and I take them seriously, but most friends to my left do not. A typical reaction is that of Elmo Keep , who dismisses AI doomsday arguments as \"the stuff of stoned freshmen who've read too much Neal Stephenson.\"\n\nIt doesn't help that alt-right funder extraordinaire Peter Thiel has long supported research into AI safety, especially at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, whose founder Eliezer Yudkowsky is nearly as polarizing as Thiel is.\n\nBut you don't have to go full Silicon Valley libertarian to become convinced that the rising power of AI is a pressing social problem. There are distinctively leftist reasons to be worried.\n\nThe most obvious is that the best-funded developers of AI, at least in the US and the UK, are private companies. Insofar as the government's involved in R&D, it's largely through the Defense Department .\n\nSo: do we want DeepMind, a Google sister company, to be developing sophisticated wargaming technology with minimal regulation? Or do we want to democratically weigh how DeepMind should proceed and make regulations as a society?\n\nBut the leftist case for worry is broader than this. AI safety experts often characterize the problem as one of \"alignment\": Is the goal for which AI is optimizing aligned with the goals of humanity as a whole? To use an oft-repeated thought experiment , would a sufficiently powerful AI, told to produce (say) paperclips, end up hoarding resources until it destroys the world and uses all the Earth's resources to build paperclips?\n\nThat's a ridiculous example and one that I find turns off a lot of the not-already-converted, including some eminent AI researchers who find talk of apocalypse overblown. But here's a less ridiculous one.\n\nLet's say that Pittsburgh wants to more effectively respond to cases of child neglect, and better triage its case workers so they investigate the worst cases. So the city builds a predictive model based on thousands of previous cases that can assign a score to each case that comes through that helps prioritize it.\n\nBut using previous cases to train the AI means it winds up baking in a lot of prejudices from previous generations of case workers, who may have been biased against poor and black parents.\n\nThis method is not very precise and produces a lot of false positives, but its air of precision and science means that case workers have started to defer to the algorithm. It has gained power in spite of its weak empirical underpinnings.\n\nThis is not a hypothetical example. This is the story of the Allegheny Family Screening Tool (AFST), an algorithm used by the county encompassing Pittsburgh to triage child abuse cases. Virginia Eubanks , a political scientist at the University of Albany, chronicles this system and its many limitations in Automating Inequality (2018), the best single book on technology and government I've read.\n\nOften cases like this are conceptualized through the prism of rights to privacy, or rights to oversight over algorithms; my colleague Sigal Samuel has done incredible work on this front. But fundamentally it's an AI alignment problem of exactly the same kind, if not the same scale, that MIRI and effective altruists worry about.\n\nSome in the artificial intelligence research community having been urging researchers and advocates to make these connections. \"Some critics have argued that long-term concerns about artificial general intelligence (AGI), or superintelligence, are too hypothetical and (in theory) too far removed from current technology for meaningful progress to be made researching them now,\" Cambridge's Stephen Cave and Seán S. ÓhÉigeartaigh wrote in Nature: Machine Intelligence earlier this year. \"However, a number of recent papers have illustrated not only that there is much fruitful work to be done on the fundamental behaviors and limits of today's machine learning systems, but also that these insights could have analogues to concerns raised about future AGI systems.\"\n\nThere is a left/libertarian alliance to be made in translating Bay Area worries about the long-run capabilities of AI into worries about the way it's being deployed right this minute. We could be using these more primitive technologies to build a precedent for how to handle alignment problems that will become vastly more complex with time.\n\nAs the Silicon Valley libertarians set their sights to more specific cases, leftists should set them a bit wider. The automation of governance will not stop with Pittsburgh's family services system. It will be vastly more dramatic in 10, 20, 30 years.\n\nAnd the only way to ensure alignment is to stop treating this as a silly issue, and actively engage with AI safety.\n\nSign up for the Future Perfect newsletter.

      "text": "Leftists, liberals, and neoliberals share a problem: Congress\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nCongress, not neoliberalism, hamstrung Obama's presidency.\n\nby Ezra Klein\n\nWhat are we talking about when we talk about neoliberalism?\n\nIn its simplest form, neoliberalism refers to a general preference for market mechanisms over state interventions. But since almost everyone sometimes prefers market mechanisms to state interventions, and sometimes prefer state interventions to market mechanisms, the conversation quickly gets confusing. Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were neoliberals . Bill Clinton is often seen as a neoliberal. Barack Obama is sometimes considered a neoliberal. Elizabeth Warren is occasionally called a neoliberal.\n\nA label that can describe everyone doesn't usefully describe anyone. In recent years, neoliberal has reemerged as political slander, meaning something like \"corporatist sellout Democrat.\" Kean Birch, author of an intellectual history of neoliberalism, argues that the term has collapsed into incoherence, with too many people using it to describe too many things for the conversation to remain constructive. Jon Chait argues that the word neoliberal has become an all-purpose insult, \"an attempt to win an argument with an epithet.\"\n\nI think we need the term neoliberalism. At its most useful, neoliberalism describes what happens when capitalism mutates from an economic system to a governing and even moral philosophy. That's a more pervasive and destructive phenomenon than we tend to realize, and the idea of neoliberalism is the closest we have for a word that describes it.\n\nBut for that reason, I've become more frustrated with the lazy ways the term is tossed around - and, particularly, how it becomes an all-purpose explanation for any political outcome someone doesn't like.\n\nFarhad Manjoo's latest column in the New York Times is an example. Manjoo argues that \"Barack Obama's biggest mistake rhymes with 'schneo-liberalism.'\" But his examples, for the most part, have less to do with Obama administration ideology than congressional vote counting.\n\nThis is confusion with an agenda. If, say, the stimulus was too small because Obama was a market-fetishizing neoliberal rather than a far-sighted leftist, simply replacing him with a leftist will solve the problem.\n\nBut that wasn't the problem.\n\nObama and his administration were market-oriented progressives. They were, and are, well to the right of Bernie Sanders. But they were well to the left of what Congress was willing to pass on literally any day of the Obama presidency.\n\nTake Manjoo's first example: the stimulus. He writes:\n\nBy the time Obama took office, job losses had accelerated so quickly that his advisers calculated the country would need $1.7 trillion in additional spending to get back to full employment. A handful of advisers favored a very large government stimulus of $1.2 trillion ; some outside economists - Paul Krugman , Joseph Stiglitz , James Galbraith - also favored going to a trillion.\n\nBut Obama's closest advisers declined to push Congress for anything more than $800 billion, which they projected would reduce unemployment to below 8 percent by the 2010 midterms.\n\nThe argument here took place between Christina Romer, who led Obama's Council of Economic Advisors, and Larry Summers, who directed the National Economic Council. In an early memo presenting various goals for the stimulus, Romer listed, as her shock-and-awe option, a stimulus that would \"eliminate the output gap by 2011-Q1,\" which she estimated would require a \"package costing about $1.8 trillion over two years.\"\n\nObama never saw that option. In the final memo Summers crafted, it was deleted as politically impossible. But here's the thing: Summers and Romer are both, in the popular definition of the term, neoliberals. They're both economists who believe strongly in markets. Krugman and Stiglitz are also lumped in as neoliberals. Correctly calculating the size of the output gap wasn't a question that divided neoliberals from leftists. The disagreement was political. Congressional leaders had told the Obama administration that the price tag had to fall under $1 trillion if the package was to have any hope of passing, and the administration listened.\n\nYou can argue, as a political judgment, that they shouldn't have listened. But the Obama administration didn't want a repeat of the TARP experience, where Congress voted down the bill and sent markets reeling. The economy was far weaker by the time Obama took office, and the fear was that another shock would prove catastrophic. They believed, wrongly, that if the downturn deepened and more stimulus was needed, Congress would approve it.\n\n\"If you're at the barber and they don't cut your hair short enough, you can always ask them to go a little further,\" Jared Bernstein, a left-leaning economist who served in the Obama administration, told me in 2011 . \"That's sort of how I thought about stimulus policy. I don't think we could have done more in February of 2009 based on political and implementation constraints. But I probably didn't recognize how hard it would be to go back to the barbershop.\"\n\nIt's worth remembering that even the $787 billion stimulus barely passed, and the three Republicans who provided the crucial votes insisted on $30 billion in cuts and a substantial shift from direct spending to tax breaks. In 2011, with the recession grinding on, the Obama administration proposed another $447 billion in stimulus but Congress ignored the request.\n\nThe idea that a $1.8 trillion stimulus was possible is fantasy, and the reason for that was Congress, not neoliberalism.\n\nThe stimulus isn't Manjoo's only example. Take this passage:\n\nIt is true that Obama succeeded in passing a groundbreaking universal health care law. It's also true that over the course of his presidency, inequality grew, and Obama did little to stop it . While much of the rest of the country struggled to get by, the wealthy got wealthier and multimillionaires and billionaires achieved greater political and cultural power.\n\nIn 2013, Obama called inequality \"the defining challenge of our time\" and proposed a raft of policies for curbing it. Remember the Buffett tax? Or closing the carried-interest loophole? Obama's 2015 budget included $1.3 trillion in tax increases on the wealthy and corporations, and it intended to spend those funds, in part, on universal pre-k. That budget went nowhere in Congress. The blockage wasn't a neoliberal ideology that considered soaring inequality just or beneficial. It was Republicans.\n\nYou can argue, fairly, that the Obama administration's proposed solutions would not have driven America toward anything even approaching economic equality. I'd agree with that critique, but it doesn't explain how a yet larger package would've had more success in John Boehner's House.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is a more interesting example. Manjoo writes:\n\nObama's biggest ideas were neoliberal: The Affordable Care Act, his greatest domestic policy achievement, improved access to health care by altering private health-insurance markets.\n\nI think it's correct to see the ACA as a neoliberal approach to expanding health insurance coverage. But the particular reason that Democrats embraced it wasn't because most of them preferred it to all possible alternatives. I covered that process extensively, and literally no Democrats I spoke to framed the ACA as their ideal policy. But, after decades of watching health reform fail in Congress, Democrats saw Mitt Romney's reforms succeed in Massachusetts and decided to copy them at the national level in a bid for Republican support.\n\nIt's worth remembering that this was the strategy favored by, among others, Sen. Ted Kennedy, who brought John McDonough, who'd worked on the Massachusetts plan, to the Senate as his top health care adviser. The idea that a Romney-style approach would garner Republican votes proved wrong, though the idea that it could pass proved right. Even here, though, the plan was pushed far to the right during congressional negotiations, with Sen. Ben Nelson, among others, killing the public option, and Sen. Joe Lieberman knifing the proposal to expand Medicare to age 55.\n\nThe Obama administration made plenty of mistakes, some of them purely ideological. They bought into the deficit-hysteria of 2010-2011 in a genuinely damaging way. Their housing policy was weak , and while the politics of housing were much harder than is now remembered - it was the administration's tepid HARP proposal that led to the Tea Party revolt - the administration should've put their back into passing \" cramdown \" and used more TARP money directly on homeowners.\n\nThere are places where a left president would've differed dramatically from Obama, starting with personnel. A leftist wouldn't have nominated Timothy Geithner as treasury secretary, kept Ben Bernanke on at the Federal Reserve, or been as personally conciliatory toward Wall Street. Manjoo also mentions deploying antitrust laws to break up Google and Facebook and Amazon, though he admits that he, like virtually everyone else during the Obama era, loudly opposed anything of the kind.\n\nBut you can't blame everything on neoliberalism. If the Obama administration had been able to get what it wanted, there would have been far more stimulus, a public option in Obamacare, larger subsidies for health insurance, higher taxes on the rich and corporations, hundreds of billions more in infrastructure investment and social spending, universal pre-k, a cap-and-trade plan to curb climate change, comprehensive immigration reform, and much more.\n\nThe agenda the Obama administration passed isn't the agenda it wanted. The agenda the Obama administration passed is the agenda they could pass. It was congressional Republicans (and, sometimes, Democrats), not neoliberalism, that curbed their ambitions. It'd be interesting to compare an idealized neoliberal agenda to an idealized left agenda, but you can't do that by looking at the few policies that survived the filibuster.\n\nManjoo waves this away. \"If he'd been in the mood to press the case, Obama might have found widespread public appetite for the sort of aggressive, interventionist restructuring of the American economy that Franklin D. Roosevelt conjured with the New Deal,\" he writes.\n\nEven ignoring the actual evidence we have on public opinion, the fact is that FDR entered office years into the Great Depression, and the agony of the suffering swept him in alongside a massive Democratic wave. Unemployment was above 20 percent when Roosevelt took office, rather than 7.8 percent, as was true for Obama. That misery didn't just hand Roosevelt the White House in 1932, it gave Democrats 313 House seats to the GOP's 113, and 59 Senate seats to the GOP's 36. It was those huge congressional majorities, operating in a time of less polarization and far more economic suffering, that made Roosevelt's agenda possible.\n\nThat's not to argue that Obama shared Roosevelt's outlook or would have mimicked his administration even if he could have. I genuinely have no idea what Obama would've done if he took office in the midst of 23 percent unemployment and nearly total control of Congress, just as I don't know what Roosevelt would've done if he took office with 7.8 percent unemployment and slimmer majorities. But the case that the two men's records were separated primarily by ideology and ambition is thin.\n\nToward the end of his column, Manjoo poses a question. \"What's the point of returning to this history now, a decade later?\" he asks. His answer:\n\nThink of it as a cautionary tale - a story that ought to rank at the top of mind for a Democratic electorate that is now choosing between Obama's vice president and progressives like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, who had pushed Obama, during the recovery, to adopt policies with more egalitarian economic effects ... not only did Obama's policy ideas produce lackluster economic results (at least in that they failed to hit their stated goals), they failed politically, too. The sluggish recovery in Obama's first years led to a huge loss for Democrats in the 2010 midterms.\n\nManjoo has the right idea here and the wrong conclusion. This is a cautionary tale. The results of the Obama administration's legislative failures were catastrophic in both human and political terms. But replace the Obama administration with a further left administration in Manjoo's story. What changes, exactly? How would President Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren have changed Sen. Joe Lieberman and Ben Nelson's minds on the public option? How would they have gotten the Republican votes they needed in the Senate to support more stimulus spending?\n\nThese are questions not of neoliberalism versus leftism but of political strategy and institutional constraint. Many on the left are, like Manjoo, loading neoliberalism with a weight it cannot bear. Condemning neoliberalism becomes a way of hiding from the harsh strictures of America's polarized, paralyzed political process, in which geography and gerrymandering gives Republicans a constant congressional advantage and Fox News spins an alternative reality on the daily.\n\nThe truth is that Obama-style liberals and Sanders-style leftists face a similar problem: both are well to the left of the median member of Congress, and both want to pass agendas far more ambitious than anything Congress has done in decades. How do they do it?\n\nThe hard choices here were underscored by another piece the New York Times published on Wednesday, profiling Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's efforts to modulate her approach to better fit the constraints of the institution in which she serves:\n\nAfter nearly nine months, with her eyes now wide open to the downsides of her revolutionary reputation and social media fame, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has tempered her brash, institution-be-damned style with something different: a careful political calculus that adheres more closely to the unwritten rules of Washington she once disdained.\n\n\"I think I have more of a context of what it takes to do this job and survive on a day-to-day basis in a culture that is inherently hostile to people like me,\" Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview.\n\nOcasio-Cortez isn't losing her ideological fire. She's adapting to the institution that surrounds her. She'd like a policy and political approach well to the left of what exists now. But if she's going to get anything done, she needs to find ways to work with the members who are already there, members who are to her right ideologically but whose votes are necessary if she's going to pass anything.\n\nThere are real differences between neoliberals and leftists, and those debates are healthy to have. But the fundamental constraint on Democratic administrations is not how far left they are, but how far left Congress is. If Bernie Sanders is elected president in 2020 but he's facing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, he's going to end up passing a more compromised policy agenda than if, say, Michael Bennet wins the presidency and Democrats take back the Senate. That's not because Bennet is to Sanders's left, but because it's Congress, not the president, that writes and passes laws.\n\n\"Only now, in the age of Sanders and Warren and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, are we beginning to relearn the lessons of the past,\" writes Manjoo.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not sure we are learning them. If you look back on the Obama administration's shortcomings and see a purely ideological story, then you've missed the political institutions that not only constrained him, but will act with as much or more force against Sanders, Warren, or AOC.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nOne of the theories is beloved by centrists. The other is believed by leftists. Neither is looking good.\n\nby Ezra Klein\n\nIt's still early days, but Bernie Sanders's 2020 presidential campaign is throwing two cherished theories of presidential electability into question.\n\nOne of those theories is beloved by self-styled centrists, and has served as a way to gate-keep against more liberal candidates. It argues that Americans are ideological moderates who punish political parties for nominating candidates too far to the left or right.\n\nThe other is beloved by leftists, and has served as a cudgel against more centrist candidates. It holds that there's a vast working-class majority out there for any candidate willing to slough off the Democratic Party's turn to corporatism, free trade, and identity politics and recapture the economic populism that made the New Deal Democrats dominant for a generation.\n\nNeither theory, right now, is looking particularly strong.\n\nTo begin, let's look at a few recent polls. A Fox News poll matched up leading Democrats against Donald Trump. Vice President Joe Biden led by 11 points, the largest margin of any Democrat. Bernie Sanders was in second place, with a 5-point lead. An Emerson poll tested a similar question and found both Biden and Sanders beating Trump by 8 points. Quinnipiac ran a head-to-head in all-important Pennsylvania and found , again, that Biden and Sanders led the pack, with 11- and 7-point leads over Trump, respectively.\n\nBusiness Insider, meanwhile, decided to poll something else. It asked Americans to rank the Democrats by how liberal they were. Here, Sanders leaped far ahead of the pack. \"Americans believe Sanders is the most liberal candidate in the Democratic field - by a wide margin,\" wrote Insider. Sanders isn't just viewed as far more liberal than Biden; he's viewed as far more liberal than Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, and Beto O'Rourke.\n\nSo what we can say about the head-to-head polling, right now, is that Biden and Sanders lead Trump by the largest margins, with Biden typically holding a slightly larger lead than Sanders. And that's true even though Sanders is viewed as far more liberal than any other Democrat in the race.\n\nThis presents a challenge to two traditional theories of electability.\n\nCentrists have long held that the electorate is ideologically moderate and temperamentally cautious and will penalize political parties for nominating ideologically extreme candidates. There's been some evidence for this. Barry Goldwater and George McGovern were wiped out in their respective races, and political scientists have long believed that voters penalize candidates who seem too far to the left or right.\n\nBut that wisdom, which has been so deliciously conventional for so long, has come under recent attack. A 2016 paper by Marty Cohen, Mary McGrath, Peter Aronow, and John Zaller carefully analyzed the data for every presidential election between 1948 and 2012. \"We find scant evidence of extremism penalties,\" they concluded.\n\nA 2019 paper by Stephen Utych looked at congressional races and concluded that \"while moderates have historically enjoyed an advantage over ideologically extreme candidates,\" that \"gap has disappeared in recent years.\" Today, Utych found, \"moderates and ideologically extreme candidates are equally likely to be elected.\"\n\nThis matches what we're seeing in the early 2020 polling. Sanders is considered the most liberal Democrat in the race. But he's right there with Biden in leading Trump by the widest margins. The centrist belief that voters will be turned off by a liberal nominee isn't holding up well.\n\nLeftists have long had a counter to the centrist theory of electability. In their telling, Democrats lost their post-New Deal dominance by embracing corporations, free trade, and neoliberalism. Medicare-for-all polls great. Minimum wage increases and Medicaid expansions pass easily even in the reddest states. There's an overwhelming popular majority lying latent for a leftist candidate willing to recapture the old faith. No one has believed this theory as long or as fervently as Sanders himself; it serves as the foundation of his belief in the possibility of \" political revolution .\"\n\nSanders, however, is also the best test this theory has had in modern times. And it, too, is coming up short. Sanders has spent the past four years as one of the country's most prominent political voices. He isn't another milquetoast Democrat. He's a democratic socialist who wants to take on the corporations, the millionaires, the billionaires. He wants Medicare-for-all and stronger unions and higher taxes. If you know of him, that's what you know about him.\n\nYet Sanders is polling like any other Democrat. He's a bit behind Biden and ahead of Warren in head-to-head matchups with Trump, but fundamentally, he polls like both of them and draws his support from the same voters as them. His national approval rating is in the mid-40s , and his net favorability \"is at about the same level as the other people who have declared their candidacy for the Democratic nomination,\" writes CNN's Harry Enten.\n\nIf the leftist theory of electability was correct, we should, by this point, be seeing some evidence of it. But instead, Sanders looks like any reasonably electable Democrat, not a candidate whose coalition dwarfs that of other Democrats.\n\nWe're early in the 2020 election, of course. Perhaps, as voters tune in, they'll penalize or reward Sanders for his politics in ways that will make a hash of this analysis. But I think it's more likely that 2020 will confirm what we saw in 2016, and 2012, and 2008. The electorate is largely frozen. Swing voters are endangered. The differences between the parties are clear enough that most people know which side they're on.\n\nThat's not to say that marginal differences don't matter. In 2016, the world turned on 75,000 votes in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. In a country that closely divided, everything matters. But the reason the election was so close in the first place is that Donald Trump, for all his antics and heterodoxies, managed to consolidate the Republican vote as efficiently as Mitt Romney did before him. What's always been remarkable about the 2016 election isn't its abnormality but its normality .\n\nThe same is likely to be true in 2020. This is a winnable election for Democrats, but it's also a losable one. That Fox News poll I mentioned earlier had another result worth pulling out. By a 54-38 margin, Americans want to elect someone who isn't Trump in 2020. But rewind the clock to June 2011, and by a 49-44 margin, Americans wanted to elect someone who wasn't Barack Obama.\n\nObama, of course, went on to win in 2012. The good news for Democrats is that Trump is now, and always has been, less popular than Obama. The bad news for Democrats is that there's no simple rule of electability they can follow in trying to beat Trump. It's not as easy as simply nominating a safe moderate, or a left-populist.

Early news coverage, social media algorithms, and politicians and commentators from both major parties zeroed in on protests celebrating Hamas, social media posts by far-left groups, and open letters and rallies organized on college campuses as the true face of the American left. But many of these activists and organizers have spent the last week rebutting that image, refocusing the political and media narrative about the consequences of the Israel-Hamas war and American complicity, and building up support for American diplomacy from the grassroots and in Washington.\n\nThis wasn't the first major demonstration in the capital - a weekend protest organized by the pro-Palestinian advocacy group American Muslims for Palestine also drew thousands - but these anti-war protestors marched to the White House as their calls picked up institutional recognition and support in the halls of Congress . On Monday, 13 progressive members of Congress - not just the Squad - signed on to a resolution calling on the Biden administration to broker an immediate ceasefire in Israel and Palestine and urge de-escalation in order to bring humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"That resolution represents what most of us actually want to see,\" Beth Miller, the political director of Jewish Voice for Peace Action, one of the groups that organized the Monday protest, told Vox. \"The most important thing for our members of Congress to understand and for the general American public to understand is that there is no military solution to what is happening right now. Israel is dropping bombs on entire families and neighborhoods of people, and it will not solve anything. It will only lead to more violence in the long run.\"\n\nThe protest, which continued into the evening as demonstrators blocked roads and entrances to the White House and adjoining government buildings, came on a day when activists said they felt winds changing. Yes, there was early splintering in the left's response and domination by fringe and radical elements during the days following Hamas's mass infiltration of southern Israel. But progressive groups are better organized now, feel more emboldened to make demands of American leaders, and feel like they're gaining support in Congress. They say the images from Gaza, the rhetoric of politicians in Israel and the US, the devastation caused by the Israeli military, and the \"blank check\" issued by American leaders to Israel are all fueling their movement and reinforcing the message they want the public to hear. On Wednesday, these same organizers would take protestors directly to Congress, marching to the Capitol, sitting-in at a congressional office building, and, like at the White House, some would get arrested.\n\nThe hearts, minds, and policies they're trying to change won't be easily altered. Though most Americans were sympathetic to both Palestinians and Israelis and open to more nuanced solutions to the Israel-Palestine conflict, public polling from last week following Hamas's attack shows Americans, including more Democrats and independents , warming to the Israeli military's response . This shift is likely driven by a desire to support a nation that has just suffered a massive, graphic, and morally reprehensible attack.\n\n\"Over the last week, what we have seen come out of Washington, DC, is overwhelming vitriol - vitriolic hostility toward Palestinians. I worked in this movement for about 13 years, and I have been blown back by some of what I've seen and heard from our own elected officials,\" Miller said. \"Our own government is currently working to support mass atrocities being committed by the Israeli government. That's essentially the state of affairs right now in DC.\"\n\nThat perspective is what makes progressive activists feel like their efforts are all the more urgent: If more war crimes and atrocities are imminent, they need to act now.\n\nWashington's official consensus has long been strong support for Israel; that stretches across the overwhelming majority of both elected Republicans and Democrats. Criticism of Israel, its occupation of parts of the West Bank and Gaza, and its treatment of Palestinians in general, has long been taboo - and usually limited to the most progressive wing of the Democratic Party.\n\nFor progressive activists, the first congressional resolution circulated in the wake of the Hamas attack and Israel's military response is evidence of this institutional bias. The four-page statement, introduced by the Republican and Democratic leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee three days after the attack, has massive bipartisan support - over 400 members of Congress have signed onto it. It condemns Hamas, is a statement of resolute support for and solidarity with the state of Israel, and mourns American and Israeli lives lost - all of which made sense in the immediate aftermath of the attack. Yet the statement makes no mention of Palestinian lives lost since Israel started its campaign of airstrikes in Gaza, and it hasn't been updated to include the civilian deaths Israel's military response has caused in the region.\n\n\"That resolution is going to go down as one of the most shameful resolutions in terms of its timing and its content,\" said Miller. \"That resolution essentially says that the United States will stand with Israel pretty much no matter what it does, and it only talks about or mourns the loss of Israeli life without even paying lip service to or even acknowledging the fact that the Israeli military has killed Palestinians.\"\n\nThe growing number of civilian deaths in Gaza, coupled with reports of worsening humanitarian conditions and the escalating tactics used by Israel - like cutting off electricity and water to the Gaza Strip and ordering the evacuation of 1 million people to southern Gaza in anticipation of a ground invasion - have all made it easier, and increasingly urgent, for more rank-and-file Democrats to step up their criticism of Israel in the past few days. Earlier this month, a contingent of 17 House Democrats urged the State Department to step up information and resources for Palestinian Americans and American citizens currently stuck in the Gaza Strip.\n\nCongressional reactions to media reports of the northern Gaza evacuation order seemed to mark a turning point: Suddenly , more House Democrats felt more comfortable voicing concerns about Israel's response. That shift contributed to a second House effort on October 13. Led by progressive Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) and Mark Pocan (D-WI), 55 House Democrats signed a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to remind Israel and neighboring countries that its actions \"must be carried out according to international law and take all due measures to limit harm to innocent civilians.\" They called for the establishment of a humanitarian corridor to bring aid into Gaza and allow Palestinians and other civilians out of the Strip, and asked that humanitarian aid be ensured for \"both Palestinians in Gaza and Israelis,\" among other requests.\n\nBut that statement came short of calling for a ceasefire, which left-leaning activists are now demanding, in part over fears that such a call would drive down the number of Democrats who eventually signed on to the letter, according to a report from the Intercept . Ultimately, 13 of the most progressive Democrats would introduce their own resolution centered on a ceasefire and recognition of the civilian lives lost in both Gaza and Israel.\n\nThis marks a major change from the way Congress was operating in the days after the Hamas attack, when a Fox News reporter chased Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib - the only Palestinian American member of Congress - around the basement tunnels of the US Capitol asking her to condemn Hamas, and when other members of Congress were criticizing progressives for raising concerns about Israel's response. Few Democrats chose to defend their colleagues; some angrily confronted them or criticized them in the press. Some took the time to cut ties with leftist organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), which had immediately expressed solidarity with Palestinians after the Hamas attack and whose New York City chapter had been linked to an at-times antisemitic protest in Times Square that weekend.\n\nDSA-backed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned that protest, and allies of Rep. Jamaal Bowman told the New York Times that the congressman was no longer a DSA member. Rep. Shri Thanedar, another DSA-backed progressive, similarly condemned the demonstration and disassociated himself with the group.\n\nThanedar, a self-described progressive, also told Vox last week that calls for de-escalation and a ceasefire were premature: \"Now is not the time to talk about restraint; this is the time to go after the terrorists and Israel is justified in sending the message that such terroristic acts will not be tolerated.\"\n\nThe same sentiment was echoed by the White House last Tuesday. When Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked about congressional progressives' statements calling for a ceasefire, she said the White House believed they are \"wrong,\" \"repugnant,\" and \"disgraceful.\"\n\n\"Our condemnation belongs squarely with terrorists who have brutally murdered, raped, kidnapped hundreds - hundreds of Israelis,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"There can be no equivocation about that. There are not two sides here. There are not two sides.\"\n\nNo progressive groups or activists who spoke with Vox were claiming there were two sides to the killing of civilians by Hamas in Israel - but they all agree that there should be no equivocation about the thousands of civilian deaths and injuries in Gaza since Israel launched its air campaign in response.\n\nThey all condemned Hamas's atrocities against civilians. They say that at this point in the conflict their fears of a potential \"genocide\" in the Gaza Strip should be the most immediate concern. They point to the hawkish and violent rhetoric coming from political leaders in both Israel and the US as signs that military restraint is off the table, that concern for civilian lives is not a factor, and that few Democratic and essentially no Republican leaders care about the rising civilian death toll in Gaza since Israel began its military operations.\n\n\"Most mainstream, responsible, progressive, humane voices are doing everything they can to raise the alarm about the possibility of mass, indiscriminate violence in Gaza,\" Simone Zimmerman, a co-founder of the progressive American Jewish organization IfNotNow and an organizer with the Diaspora Alliance, an organization working to fight antisemitism, told Vox. \"Most of us are just really trying to call on anyone who will listen to try to help move the situation towards de-escalation and to stop the Israeli government from perpetuating mass atrocities on 2 million people who do not deserve to die.\"\n\nIn the immediate term, Zimmerman and other organizers said that they want more American leaders to forcefully condemn the killing of civilians, emergency response workers, journalists, and United Nations personnel by Israeli strikes in Gaza. They are shocked that more Democrats have not spoken out about Israel cutting off water and power to the Strip, about the fate of American citizens in Gaza, or the long-expected Israeli military ground incursion. They'd like some acknowledgement of Palestinian lives lost in addition to Israeli lives. They demand an end to \" collective punishment .\" And they urge Western leaders to be careful with just how much of a blank check they are willing to give the Israeli government.\n\nIn the long run, progressive activists and organizers say they still stand by a more nuanced position for the US to be critical of Israel's unequal treatment of Palestinian people, of the occupation of Palestinian territory in Gaza and the West Bank, and of American military support that ignores human rights violations. And they hope more progressive lawmakers amplify that message in Washington.\n\n\"This situation is also clear evidence of why the US needs to do more to prioritize and address resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and that means securing self-determination and safety and freedom for both the Israeli and Palestinian people,\" said Logan Bayroff, the communications director for the liberal Israeli American group J Street. \"Those sentiments can coexist with full-throated, unequivocal condemnation of Hamas slaughtering civilians and support for Israel trying to counter Hamas.\"\n\nThese activist groups are now working to make their section of the American left the one best heard in DC and around the country; the Monday protest at the White House and Wednesday's protest on Capitol Hill were a way of doing this. But they weren't the voices picked up by news outlets, politicians, commentators, and social media in the immediate aftermath of the attack. In the days after October 7, a combination of right-wing broadsides and the radical responses from a swath of self-described leftists made it harder for them to get their message to the public and to government leaders. It's hard to quantify just how big the contingent of war-crime apologists in the American left is, but the fact that it was even a topic of conversation is evidence of the problem other left-leaning activists have to overcome.\n\nThose extreme reactions - the ones that called the massacre of civilians a legitimate and \" desperate \" form of resistance, the ones that appeared to stand with Hamas , the ones that celebrated the deaths of concertgoers - have already gotten plenty of coverage.\n\nMany right-wing media commentators , conservative politicians, and pro-Israel hardliners seized on the more provocative left-wing reactions to conflate apologists for Hamas's war crimes with critics of the Israeli status quo more broadly. In attacking the White House response, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), for example, has spent much of the last week promoting statements from these leftist groups and referencing \" Israel-hating leftist activists \" and \" rampant, unchecked antisemitism \" when criticizing the White House's response, highlighting a since-deleted State Department statement urging \" restraint \" and attacking progressive Congress members' calls for a ceasefire. Fox News host Sean Hannity spent the top of his Wednesday night show using those radical reactions to attack the Democratic Party as a whole . And thought piece after thought piece has meditated on what the future of the activist left could be after the flawed and splintered response.\n\n\"There is a desire from some to use these moments of tragedy as an excuse to try to cut off any serious policy debate or discussion ... to try to use this as an excuse to label anybody who expresses any support whatsoever for Palestinian rights, for Palestinian statehood, any opposition to ongoing occupation, as somehow you being a hater of Israel, a supporter of Hamas, an antisemite,\" said Bayroff.\n\nMeanwhile, the nuanced, unequivocal statements by progressive groups like Win Without War , Indivisible , J Street , IfNotNow , the Adalah Justice Project , and the Center for International Policy did not get picked up in the same way as those more radical voices promoted on social media - something progressive leaders wanted to contrast with the statements by more fringe groups.\n\nAs Israel's response continues, as horrific stories of death and destruction trickle out, and as the pro-Israel majority in Washington carries on, progressive politicians and activists face an asymetric challenge: holding their left-wing coalitions together, winning over more on the center-left of elected power, beating back attacks from the political right, and doing it all with a political and media environment that is stacked against them.\n\nRepublicans are united in support of whatever Israel does. Amid the fixation on leftist campus activists and social media posts, lawmakers are openly calling for war crimes: Republican senators like Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida have used extreme rhetoric. Graham urged Israel to \" level \" Gaza while Rubio said Israel should destroy Hamas by whatever means necessary (\"This tragically necessary effort will come at a horrifying price,\" he said on X, formerly known as Twitter ). Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) has said Israel shouldn't be held responsible for civilian deaths: \"As far as I'm concerned, Israel can bounce the rubble in Gaza. Anything that happens in Gaza is the responsibility of Hamas,\" he said on Sunday . So far, they seem to have escaped official opprobrium.\n\nThough more House Democrats have spoken up, few in the Senate, with notable exceptions like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Ed Markey (D-MA), have spoken up to urge restraint.\n\nThat status quo \"is a much bigger problem because, while there may be some fringe elements on campuses or at rallies who are saying horrific things about Hamas, we have people saying horrific things about Palestinians at the highest levels of our government in both parties, or they're turning a blind eye toward it,\" Waleed Shahid, the former spokesperson for the progressive political organization Justice Democrats, told Vox. \"Jamaal Bowman, AOC, other progressive leaders, have condemned what happened at this rally in New York and what happened with this group in Chicago, [but] I haven't heard Joe Biden or Hakeem Jeffries, or anyone condemn what Lindsey Graham said or what Netanyahu has said repeatedly about the Palestinian people.\"\n\nAnd that asymmetry, some activists said, extends to whose stories get told in national news coverage. \"There's this obsessive one-sided fixation on Israeli victimhood and lengthy interviews with Israeli parents, while Palestinian families are entirely ignored, even though they're being decimated,\" said Omar Baddar, the former communications director for the Institute for Middle East Understanding. \"To ignore that, I think ... is a travesty. And right-wing media should be called out for their absolutely racist coverage and their selective outrage for some victims and not others.\"\n\nThese calls for restraint, for de-escalation, for humanitarian aid and forceful condemnation of the killing of civilians \"aren't a very radical position,\" said Sandra Tamari, a Palestinian American organizer in St. Louis, Missouri, who leads the Adalah Justice Project. \"Right now, the demands are very simple: stop the bombs and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza so that more people don't die.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThis liberal philosopher predicted Trump's rise in 1998 - and he has another warning for the left.\n\nby Sean Illing\n\nA prescient passage from a forgotten book made the rounds after Donald Trump's election. It was plucked from a 1998 book titled Achieving our Country . The author is Richard Rorty, a liberal philosopher who died in 2007. The book consists of a series of lectures Rorty gave in 1997 about the history of leftist thought in 20th-century America.\n\nTo read the viral passage is to recognize immediately why it caught fire after Trump's election:\n\nMembers of labor unions, and unorganized unskilled workers, will sooner or later realize that their government is not even trying to prevent wages from sinking or to prevent jobs from being exported. Around the same time, they will realize that suburban white-collar workers - themselves desperately afraid of being downsized - are not going to let themselves be taxed to provide social benefits for anyone else.\n\nAt that point, something will crack. The nonsuburban electorate will decide that the system has failed and start looking for a strongman to vote for - someone willing to assure them that, once he is elected, the smug bureaucrats, tricky lawyers, overpaid bond salesmen, and postmodernist professors will no longer be calling the shots.\n\nToday, Rorty's words read like prophecy. Something has cracked. People have lost faith in the system. A strongman is upon us. So what happened? Over the course of three lectures, Rorty proffers a theory. He traces the history of the modern American left to show where, in his view, it lost its way, and how that digression prepared the way for the populist right. The story he tells is compelling, detached, and often oddly romantic. But it's supremely instructive, even when it sputters.\n\nThe best way to make sense of Rorty's argument is to follow it chronologically. He sees the American left as split into two camps: the reformist left and the cultural left. The reformist left dominates from 1900 until it is supplanted by the cultural left in the mid-1960s. The division has more to do with tactics than it does principles, but those tactical differences, for Rorty at least, carried enormous consequences.\n\nHere's the case he made twenty years ago.\n\n\"I propose to use the term reformist Left,\" Rorty wrote, \"to cover all those Americans who, between 1900 and 1964, struggled within the framework of constitutional democracy to protect the weak from the strong.\" The emphasis on constitutional democracy is paramount here. Reformists believed in the system, and wanted to improve it from within.\n\nBefore the 1960s, the American left was largely reformist in its orientation to politics. Think of the people who engineered the New Deal or the Ivy-educated technocrats that joined Kennedy in the White House. John Kenneth Galbraith, the liberal economist and public official who served in the administrations of FDR, Truman, Kennedy, and Johnson, is a favorite of Rorty's. These were the liberals who weren't socialist radicals but nevertheless worked to promote the same causes within and through the system. They were liberal reformers, not revolutionary leftists, and they got things done.\n\nThe reformist left was a big tent. It included people who thought of themselves as communists and socialist as well as moderate left-of-center Democrats. What united them was a devotion to pragmatic reform; there were no purity tests, no totalizing calls for revolution, as was common among Marxists at the time. But they were \"feared and hated by the Right\" because they gave us the fundaments of the modern welfare state.\n\nThe reformers had their flaws. FDR, a classic reformist liberal, delivered the New Deal and encouraged the growth of labor unions, but he also shamefully ignored the interests of African Americans and interned Japanese Americans during WWII. Lyndon Johnson did as much as any president to improve the lives of poor children, but he also doubled down on the unjust and illegal war in Vietnam. The Harvard technocrats in the Kennedy administration were complicit in countless horrors in Vietnam. But they also created lasting domestic policies that advanced the cause of social justice.\n\nRorty admired the reformist left both because they were effective and because they understood that the key dividing line between the left the right in this country was about whether the state has a responsibility to ensure a moral and socially desirable distribution of wealth. The right rejected this proposition, the left embraced it.\n\nThe reformist left \"helped substitute a rhetoric of fraternity and national solidarity for a rhetoric of individual rights.\" They proposed a counter-narrative to the libertarian right, which fetishized the individual and made a virtue of selfishness. The idea was to convince Americans that America was best - and closest to its moral identity - when it turned left, when it sacrificed, when citizens imagined themselves as participants in an intergenerational movement.\n\nSuch an orientation didn't entail a blind spot for America's sins. \"America is not a morally pure country. No country ever has been or ever will be,\" Rorty wrote, but \"in democratic countries you get things done by compromising your principles in order to form alliances with groups about whom you have grave doubts.\" The left made tremendous progress in this way.\n\nIt accepted, as Rorty put it, that the inequities of American society had to be \"corrected by using the institutions of constitutional democracy.\" And that meant acquiring power, taking control of institutions, and persuading people with whom you disagree. It was not enough to speak truth to power; elections had to be won and coalitions forged if you wanted to get things done.\n\nThis spirit of pragmatism held the American left together until the 1960s. The focus was on improving the material conditions of Americans by winning elections and appealing to national pride. Economic justice was considered a precursor to social justice. If the system could be made to work for everyone, if you could lift more people out of poverty, socio-cultural progress would naturally follow.\n\nOr at least that was the idea.\n\nThe focus of leftist politics changed in the 1960s. For Rorty, the left ceased to be political and instead became a cultural movement. The prevailing view was that it was no longer possible to promote equality and social justice within the system.\n\nThe Vietnam War, more than anything else, set the left on its new trajectory. The war was seen as an indictment of the whole system, of America as such. Thus the broader anti-communist Cold War become a central fault line for left-wing activists. Led largely by students, the new left regarded anyone opposed to communism - including Democrats, union workers, and technocrats - as hostile.\n\nAmerica was viewed, increasingly, as a failed promise, a malevolent empire beyond redemption. Of what use is reformist politics in such a context? Rorty elaborates:\n\nFor if you turn out to be living in an evil empire (rather than, as you had been told, a democracy fighting an evil empire), then you have no responsibility to your country; you are accountable only to humanity. If what your government and your teachers are saying is all part of the same Orwellian monologue - if the differences between the Harvard faculty and the military-industrial complex, or between Lyndon Johnson and Barry Goldwater, are negligible - then you have a responsibility to make a revolution.\n\nIt's not that these sentiments were wrong; America was, for much of the country, a failed promise. The racial divide was real and socially engineered. The war in Vietnam was an inhuman sham. There was something deeply troubling about the structure of American society. Rorty disputed none of this.\n\nFrom his perspective, the problem was the total rejection of pragmatic reform. The belief that there was nothing in America that could be salvaged, no institutions that could be corrected, no laws worth passing, led to the complete abandonment of conventional politics. Persuasion was replaced by self-expression; policy reform by recrimination.\n\nThere was a shift away from economics towards a \"politics of difference\" or \"identity\" or \"recognition.\" If the intellectual locus of pre-'60s leftism was social science departments, it was now literature and philosophy departments. And the focus was no longer on advancing alternatives to a market economy or on the proper balance between political freedom and economic liberalism. Now the focus was on the cultural status of traditionally marginalized groups.\n\nIn many ways, this was a good thing. The economic determinism of the pre-'60s left was embarrassingly myopic. Most of the gains made by the left in the early and mid-20th century went to white males. \"The situation of African-Americans was deplored,\" as Rorty notes, \"but not changed by this predominantly white Left.\" The plight of minorities and gay Americans and other oppressed groups was an afterthought. This was a moral failure the cultural left sought to correct.\n\nAnd it did this by \"teaching Americans to recognize otherness,\" as Rorty put it. Multiculturalism, as it's now called, was about preserving otherness, preserving our differences; it doesn't oblige us to cease to notice those differences. There's nothing morally objectionable about that. As a political strategy, however, it's problematic. It reinforces sectarian impulses and detracts from coalition-building.\n\nThe pivot away from politics toward culture spawned academic fields like women and gender studies, African-American studies, Hispanic-American studies, LGBTQ studies, and so on. These disciplines do serious academic work, but they don't minister to concrete political ends. Their goal has been to make people aware of the humiliation and hate endured by these groups, and to alienate anyone invested in that hate.\n\nRorty doesn't object to these aims; indeed, he (rightly) celebrated them. The cultural left succeeded in making America a better, more civilized country. The problem, though, is that that progress came at a price. \"There is a dark side to the success story I have been telling about the post-sixties cultural Left,\" Rorty writes. \"During the same period in which socially accepted sadism diminished, economic inequality and economic insecurity have steadily increased. It's as if the American Left could not handle more than one initiative at a time - as if it either had to ignore stigma in order to concentrate on money, or vice versa.\"\n\nThe left's focus on cultural issues created an opening for the populist right, for people like Pat Buchanan and Donald Trump, who galvanize support among the white working class by exploiting racial resentment and economic anxiety. Rorty explains:\n\nWhile the Left's back was turned, the bourgeoisification of the white proletariat which began in WWII and continued up through the Vietnam War has been halted, and the process has gone into reverse. America is now proletarianizing its bourgeoisie, and this process is likely to culminate in bottom-up revolt, of the sort [Pat] Buchanan hopes to foment.\n\nRacial animus is baked into the founding of America; it exists regardless of what the left does. But Rorty's point holds: By divorcing itself from class and labor issues, the left lost sight of its economic agenda and waged a culture war that empowers the right and has done little to improve the lives of the very people it seeks to defend. Rorty's advice to the left was to pay attention to who benefits from such a strategy:\n\nThe super-rich will have to keep up the pretense that national politics might someday make a difference. Since economic decisions are their prerogative, they will encourage politicians of both the Left and the Right, to specialize in cultural issues. The aim will be to keep the minds of the proles elsewhere - to keep the bottom 75 percent of Americans and the bottom 95 percent of the world's population busy with ethnic and religious hostilities, and with debates about sexual mores. If the proles can be distracted from their own despair by media-created pseudo-events...the super-rich will have little to fear.\n\nBig business benefits most from the culture wars. If the left and the right are quarreling over religion or race or same-sex marriage, nothing much changes, or nothing that impacts wealth concentration changes. Rorty is particularly hard on Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, both of whom he accuses of retreating \"from any mention of redistribution\" and of \"moving into a sterile vacuum called the center.\" The Democratic Party, under this model, has grown terrified of redistributionist economics, believing such talk would drive away the suburbanite vote. The result, he concludes, is that \"the choice between the major parties has come down to a choice between cynical lies and terrified silence.\"\n\nRorty's concern was not that the left cared too much about race relations or discrimination (it should care about these things); rather, he warned that it stopped doing the hard work of liberal democratic politics. He worried that it's retreat into academia, into theory and away from the concrete, would prove politically disastrous.\n\nImmediately after the now-famous passage about a future \"strongman,\" Rorty offered yet another disturbing prophecy:\n\nOne thing that is very likely to happen is that the gains made in the past forty years by black and brown Americans, and by homosexuals, will be wiped out. Jocular contempt for women will come back into fashion. The words 'nigger' and 'kike' will once again be heard in the workplace. All the sadism which the academic Left has tried to make unacceptable to its students will come flooding back. All the resentment which badly educated Americans feel about having their manners dictated to them by college graduates will find an outlet.\n\nIf this were to happen, Rorty added, it would be a calamity for the country and the world. People would wonder how it happened, and why the left was unable to stop it. They wouldn't understand why the left couldn't \"channel the mounting rage of the newly dispossessed\" and speak more directly to the \"consequences of globalization.\" They would conclude that the left had died, or that it existed but was \"no longer able to engage in national politics.\"\n\nAnd they would be right in at least one sense: On a purely political level, the left would have failed.\n\n\"Democracy is a great word, whose history, I suppose, remains unwritten, because that history has yet to be enacted.\" --Walt Whitman\n\nThere's much to dispute in Rorty's endogenous critique of the left. To begin with, his distinction between the reformist left and the cultural left is overly simplistic, as is his discussion of the compatibility of these projects. It's also unclear how neatly the left, as it's constructed today, fits into Rorty's binary distinction. Much of his argument stands, but the political landscape has changed dramatically.\n\nRorty is also strangely sanguine about the race question. There's a causal connection between the injustices of the past and the injustices of the present that makes history impossible to avoid. And one could argue that Rorty fails to appreciate just how entrenched racism is in this country.\n\nAt times, moreover, he seems to imply that the cultural strides made by the post-'60s left could have come about another way, and yet it's never clear how. And if, as he admits, the gains of the pre-'60s left fell mostly to white males, was a revolt not justified?\n\nThere is, finally, Rorty's praise of the reformist preference for working within the system. His point that this is how things get done in a constitutional democracy is well-taken, but the strategic value of such an approach has to be reexamined in light of the public's weakened faith in that system. Confidence in the institutions of government has fallen precipitously in recent decades. Trump, after all, was elected precisely because he threatened to explode the system. As a matter of strategy, then, it's not clear that Rorty's argument holds. At the very least, it was more compelling in 1998 than it is today.\n\nNevertheless, Rorty's vision of an \"inspirational liberalism\" is worth revisiting. He liked the idea of reform because it signaled a process. The first of his three lectures is devoted to John Dewey and Walt Whitman, both of whom, on his view, personified American liberalism at its best. These were pragmatists who understood the role of national pride in motivating political change. They understood that politics is a game of competing stories \"about a nation's self-identity, and between differing symbols of its greatness.\"\n\nThe strength of Dewey and Whitman was that they could look at America's past with clear eyes, at the slaughter of Native Americans and the importation of slaves, and go beyond the disgust it invoked, beyond the cultural pessimism. They articulated a civic religion that challenged the country to do better, to forge a future that lived up to the promise of America. In Rorty's words, they recognized that \"stories about what a nation has been and should try to be are not attempts at accurate representation, but rather attempts to forge a moral identity.\"\n\nBoth the Right and the left have a story to tell, and the difference is enormous:\n\nFor the Right never thinks that anything much needs to be changed: it thinks the country is basically in good shape, and may well have been in better shape in the past. It sees the Left's struggle for social justice as mere troublemaking, as utopian foolishness. The Left, by definition, is the party of hope. It insists that our nation remains unachieved.\n\nIn this dynamic, the right is \"spectatorial and retrospective,\" and the left seeks to mobilize Americans as agents of change. The right exalts and papers over America's past, the left acknowledges that past but enjoins Americans to take pride in what the country might become.\n\nA candidate like Trump upends this dynamic: He's both a nostalgia candidate (\"Make America Great Again \") and someone who describes America as a carnage-filled hellscape . But Trump is an outlier; his victory represents a negation of the entire system, not a fundamental shift in how the right talks about America. It's possible that Trump's rise does signal such a shift, but it's too soon to make that determination.\n\nIn any case, Rorty's pitch to liberals stands, and it starts with the symbolism of the phrase \"Achieving our Country.\" The words are borrowed from James Baldwin, the great novelist and activist, but Rorty read them through a distinctly Nietzschean prism. Much of Rorty's scholarship was influenced by Nietzsche, and his political philosophy was no different.\n\nNietzsche conceived of life as literature. A human life is necessarily an act of self-creation, and if it's a good life, it's also one of constant self-improvement. This is how Dewey and Whitman imagined America. It was a story being written in real-time by citizen-activists. Here's Rorty on Whitman one last time:\n\nWhitman thought that we Americans have the most poetical nature because we are the first thoroughgoing experiment in national self-creation: the first nation-state with nobody but itself to please - not even God. We are the greatest poem because we put ourselves in the place of God: our essence is our existence, and our existence is in the future. Other nations thought of themselves as hymns to the glory of God. We redefine God as our future selves.\n\nRorty's discussion of Dewey and Whitman verges on the quixotic. Politics is an ugly business, and the soaring rhetoric of Whitman only takes you so far. But the broader point about national pride and projecting a vision of the future that can build a consensus for specific reforms remains as relevant as ever.\n\nRecent history seems to support Rorty's contention. Obama's implacable optimism inspired the country. Bernie Sanders's economic populism resonated with far more people than anyone supposed a year or two ago. This is a winning combination for the left. It's also the formula that Rorty endorses in Achieving our Country .\n\nPerhaps the left would do well to embrace it.\n\nThis article was originally published on January 11, 2017,\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "Listen to what socialist women are saying about misogyny on the left\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA controversy involving the podcast Chapo Trap House shines a light on bigger issues.\n\nby Anna North and Jeff Stein\n\nLike many women, Margaret McLaughlin is used to dealing with sexism and harassment, whether it's on the street or in the workplace. And the Democratic Socialists of America, where she is the Washington, DC, chair, isn't always a refuge.\n\n\"At steering committee meetings, I'm interrupted by men who feel they can talk over me,\" she said of her organization, which is 65 percent male. She's not alone. Other socialist women have told her they're \"tired of men not paying attention to the world outside of them,\" she said. \"It comes out through harassment, abuse, mansplaining, or ignoring women.\"\n\nAllegations of sexism against the socialist left aren't new. During the 2016 primary, some Hillary Clinton supporters argued that misogynist \"Bernie Bros\" were unfairly criticizing their candidate. To many leftists, these criticisms felt like a smokescreen to distract from centrists' unwillingness to confront more fundamental class divides.\n\nBut now similar criticisms are coming from within. A series of controversies over the past two weeks - many of which have stemmed indirectly from sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein - has reinvigorated a debate over whether the socialist left has done enough to condemn the misogyny in the ranks of a movement explicitly devoted to gender equality. Socialist women are becoming increasingly vocal in decrying what they call socialist men's encouragement of misogyny, while also stressing that leftist attacks on the Democratic Party cannot be reduced to sexism and that sexism is not confined to the left.\n\nFor McLaughlin and other socialist women, the fate of a renewed American socialism may hinge on this fight. Though the DSA quadrupled in size in the past year alone, it's still a blip in the larger left-wing universe . Whether the new socialist left can transcend its peripheral status will depend on if it can incorporate - and listen to - the women in the movement demanding a firmer stance against sexism.\n\n\"I don't think the men of the left are any more or less misogynistic than any other group of men,\" McLaughlin said. \"But leftist men just think with the equality of classes and races will come the equality of genders, but that's not necessarily true. If men aren't willing to do the work, it's not going to happen.\"\n\nBefore we get to the recent controversies that have brought the issue of sexism on the left to the fore, here's a quick rundown of the main players involved:\n\nThe hosts of Chapo have actively promoted the DSA, while Cum Town is less political. But both have vocal, overlapping fan bases who are active online, and both have gained an outsize visibility on the left - Chapo and its fans don't represent the full spectrum of American socialism, but few socialists, other than Sanders himself, have as big an audience or as large a platform from which to broadcast their views.\n\nEarlier this month, Josh Androsky, an officer with the DSA in Los Angeles, tweeted a photo of himself and two of the hosts of Chapo Trap House - Menaker and Christman - posing with Bill Cosby's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame (the tweet has since been deleted). The caption, \"Hey libs try taking THIS statue down,\" was a reference to conservative responses to calls to dismantle Confederate statues.\n\nThe tweet, Androsky later explained, was meant to be a criticism of Hollywood in the wake of revelations about Weinstein :\n\nBut as DSA-LA acknowledged, many saw it as an inappropriate joke at the expense of harassment and assault victims. \"The use of glib and ironic language around such a serious issue minimized the experience of survivors,\" the steering committee of DSA-LA said in a statement . \"Our city is littered with monuments to men who have abused the women in their lives and confronting that cannot happen if the conversation is one that is too hostile or glib for women and survivors to want to participate in.\"\n\nAndrosky apologized for the tweet, resigned from the Los Angeles steering committee, and pledged to undergo sensitivity training. Chapo Trap House has donated $10,000 to the Victim Rights Law Center, which helps victims of sexual abuse and assault, and the podcast hosts apologized for the Androsky joke immediately.\n\nBut around the same time, another tweet touched off further controversy. This one came from a Cum Town fan account, and accurately quoted the show's episode 73:\n\nNick in the tweet is Nick Mullen, one of the hosts of Cum Town . The tweet, like Androsky's, seemed to make light of the allegations against Weinstein, and contributed to the feeling among many that the left needs to address misogyny within its ranks.\n\nFor its part, Chapo tends to argue that it is primarily a comedy show - and that neither it nor Cum Town should be held to the standard applied to political leaders, when their main goal is to make their listeners laugh. (On its most recent episode, Frost said she had vetoed the idea of doing a full Chapo episode about sexual assault, saying a conversation about rape between four men and one woman would be \"counterproductive to the discussion\" and that other activists were better resources.) And, of course, comedians well outside the left have a long history of defending jokes deemed offensive or inappropriate by the broader culture - some don't think it makes sense to hold Chapo to a higher standard. Cum Town has similarly denied that it is about politics:\n\nAll of the above might seem a bit confusing to those not glued to the internecine debates of the online left. But the controversies have broader implications on the national political stage - particularly for the female supporters of Bernie Sanders, who deeply resent the notion that all socialists are sexists.\n\n\"For the past two years, I've been trying to defend myself and my male comrades from charges of sexism and misogyny. But we keep giving them ammunition,\" one female socialist told Vox. \"I'm worried this will be added to the litany of Bernie Bro accusations.\"\n\nChapo and other voices on the left have long criticized Hillary Clinton's approach to gender politics, arguing that Clinton only wanted to promote diversity within the richest class of Americans, rather than taking on the much more important goal of achieving economic justice for all. \"The focus shouldn't be on getting the 1 percent to be exactly the right percentage of blacks and women. The problem is America's savage gap in inequality,\" Menaker told Vox in an interview last summer.\n\nMeanwhile, liberal critics have long seen sexism in the left's attacks on Clinton; they doubted , for instance, that Chapo 's audience only enjoyed attacks against Clinton out of devotion to the class struggle.\n\nSuch criticisms have long come from the center, and many leftists have seen blanket allegations of sexism against the left as being made in bad faith, as efforts to discredit socialism without engaging with its ideas. But now some within the socialist left see a need for change - partially to remove one weapon from the centrists' arsenal, but also because they believe elevating women is crucial for the movement's survival.\n\n\"You can't promote socialism while at the same time maintaining political, and social relationships with those who see women as property and punchlines,\" the leftist Roqayah Chamseddine wrote on her blog . \"Combatting the reinforcement of patriarchy in our communities means challenging the way in which exploitation is reproduced amongst ourselves - how trauma is used as fodder for jokes, how silence is encouraged in order to spare our organizations from media attention, how victims are manipulated into questioning their memories, and feelings.\"\n\nThe tweets were just the latest evidence of a problem some women on the left say has been brewing for a while. It's not just about offensive jokes - women have reported online harassment from Chapo fans and other self-identified leftist men. (There's no reason to believe leftists are more likely to harass women online than any other political group.)\n\n\"I'm a socialist, but I've definitely been the victim of sexist Chapo fans getting mad at me on Twitter, and it makes your life fucking hell,\" another female leftist writer said. \"My unfortunate tactic is don't say anything negative about Chapo people or Cum Town people because it's not worth the shit you get.\"\n\nBoth Chapo and Cum Town revel in vulgar humor - it's part of the ethos of the \"dirtbag left,\" a term coined by Amber A'Lee Frost, one of Chapo 's hosts. As Jia Tolentino notes in her New Yorker profile of Chapo , Frost has written in detail on the politics of vulgarity, arguing that \"reclaiming vulgarity from the Trumps of the world is imperative because if we do not embrace the profane now and again, we will find ourselves handicapped by our own civility.\"\n\nBut many on the left say there's a difference between making dirty jokes and mocking assault survivors. \"I have defended the dirtbag left, and as a movement I'm interested in it and interested in vulgarity,\" said Eve Peyser, a writer at Vice and self-described leftist. But, she said, \"saying 'rape is funny' is offensive and really disrespectful to every woman I know who has been sexually assaulted.\"\n\n\"Jokes matter,\" said Tim Faust, a DSA organizer and Jacobin writer who has appeared on Chapo Trap House several times as its health care correspondent. \"The answer isn't, 'Don't make jokes.' The answer is, 'Get better at making jokes.'\"\n\n\"When we articulate what we are on the left, we must be crystal clear we are building a house or a fortress in which those who sexually assault women or harass women - or those who otherwise perpetuate or reenact any kind of oppression - aren't welcome,\" Faust said. \"End of sentence.\"\n\nMisogyny isn't \"specific to the left,\" Peyser said. \"It's pervasive.\" She takes issue with the idea that Sanders supporters are unusually sexist. \"They're no more sexist than Hillary supporters, and that talking point is a way to undermine his leftist policies,\" she said.\n\nBut, Faust points out, a failure to deal with misogyny on the left has come with a cost. Some women \"feel the culture is an impediment to their getting involved in socialist organizations.\"\n\nDemocratic socialism in America has made big strides since Sanders announced his candidacy. Left-of-center candidates are succeeding in local elections , and the DSA is growing in size and visibility. But challenges remain. Ever since Sanders's primary campaign, the socialist left has struggled with the perception - exemplified by the Bernie Bro stereotype - that it's overwhelmingly white and male.\n\nThe DSA now has many female and nonwhite leaders, and half of its national steering committee is composed of women. The group believes that the reforms it calls for, like a $15 minimum wage and single-payer health care, will help address not just economic inequality but racial and gender injustice as well. And the DSA explicitly supports programs like \"universal daycare, eldercare, and paid family leave\" as a way to help working-class and migrant women. But the perception of the group as packed with white \"brocialists\" persists. Changing that will require a serious reckoning with racism and misogyny.\n\n\"I know that a united left can push back against criticism from the center, and the only way to unite the left is to walk the walk,\" Faust said. \"The goal is to make people feel safe and comfortable so they can do the work they - and we all - want them to do.\"\n\nTo do that, leftist organizations and individuals need to make clear that they will not tolerate harassment, Faust said. \"If you abdicate that responsibility, you give people the cover to harm others.\"\n\nIn McLaughlin's view, change starts with men taking responsibility. Too often, she said, \"it still falls back on women and gender nonconforming people to be the explainers of the problem.\"\n\nShe has plans for fixing that in her chapter of the DSA. \"We're going to make men do some homework,\" she said.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this piece incorrectly stated a tweet came from Cum Town 's account, when it in fact came from a Cum Town fan account.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "7 reasons why today's left should be optimistic\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Ruy Teixeira\n\nThe election of Donald Trump was a major shock to the left. It was not supposed to happen. It was not even supposed to be possible for it to happen. Many shuffle about their daily tasks suffused in gloom and pessimism. With Trump in the White House, and the Republicans in control of Congress and most states, surely little of the progressive agenda will remain in a few years. His brand of xenophobia and authoritarianism is on the ascent; the future looks bleak both for the country and a world torn by rising populism and threatened by climate change.\n\nBut despite recent setbacks, there are many excellent reasons for the left to be optimistic. The future is brighter - much brighter - than they think.\n\nI mean this in two ways. First, there are trends that ought to hearten liberals - including the society-wide acceptance of same-sex marriage, now entrenched in the law by the Supreme Court, and the resistance to cutting new parts of the social safety net (including, so far, the main elements of the Affordable Care Act). We have made progress in recent years on issues involving basic social and economic justice - progress that seems unlikely to be reversed.\n\nBut I also believe that the left should be optimistic because optimism energizes people and wins elections . Social criticism has its place: We want to make society a better, fairer place, and pointing out flaws is an important first step. But criticism has its limits as a way to inspire social movements.\n\nHere are seven reasons optimism beats pessimism every day of the week.\n\nOver time, the left has accomplished many things, from building out the social safety net to cleaning up the environment to protecting public health to securing equal rights for women, black people, and gay people. These and many other gains of the left have a very important thing in common: They are \"sticky.\" That's a term borrowed from economics that means, simply, they will be hard to reverse. They provide benefits that people do not want to lose - and, what's more, they shift norms of what is right and wrong.\n\nSocial Security and Medicare are great examples of policies that once seemed radical and now are simply a part of life. The Affordable Care Act's core innovations may turn out that way, as well, despite the controversy that has dogged the program from its inception - and the declared intent of the current administration to eliminate it.\n\nThe ACA has provided benefits to millions who don't want them taken away, and helped to establish the principle that every American has a right to health care, guaranteed by the government. That's why the Republican attempt to radically downsize the program hit a buzzsaw. To be sure, Republicans will keep trying, and they'll do some damage. But they will not be able to \"repeal and replace\" with a fundamentally less generous program.\n\nInstead, it's more likely that the ACA, either under that name or another, will get more generous over time. As conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer recently noted : \"A broad national consensus is developing that health care is indeed a right. This is historically new. And it carries immense implications for the future. It suggests that we may be heading inexorably to a government-run, single-payer system.\"\n\nKrauthammer was despairing, but the left should be heartened by the observation. Indeed, at this point, Trump and the GOP have been reduced to hoping that if they neglect the ACA, it will collapse on its own - yet that doesn't seem to be happening (knock wood). The very desperation of this \"strategy\" is a sign that Krauthammer may well be prescient about where American health care policy is headed.\n\nWe'll see the same dynamic with the administration's attempts to gut environmental regulations. Yes, Trump's crew will do some damage, but the public will not accept actions that significantly reduce air and water quality. The benefits of a clean environment are deeply popular and the norm that the environment should be clean is well-established. There is no going back; clean air and water is another sticky reform of the left.\n\nSo it will go and so it has gone.\n\nThe left has a certain amount of faith in the conclusions of science (for example, on the basic facts of global warming), but a remarkable lack of faith when it comes to using technology - that is, applied science - to solve our problems. In fact, and unfortunately, a certain amount of techno-pessimism has gained currency on the left. This is strange, since almost everything people like about the modern world, including relatively high living standards, is traceable to the advance of technology.\n\nThis is also not an area where Trump's politics are likely to slow progress significantly, though the proposed cuts to federal funding of research won't help.\n\nFrom smart phones, flat screen TVs, and the internet to air and auto travel to central heating and air conditioning to the medical devices and drugs that cure disease and extend life to electric lights and the mundane flush toilet - the list is endless - technology has made people's lives both much better and much longer than ever before. The average person today is far, far better off than her counterpart in the past. As the Northwestern University economic historian Joel Mokyr puts it , the so-called good old days were old but they were not good.\n\nAnd what do we have to thank for all these spectacular advances? It's technology that has made possible the new goods, machines, medicine and so on that we consume, and that has fueled the economic growth that allows us to consume at such a high level. One would think, therefore, that the left would embrace techno-optimism: After all, if the goal is to improve people's lives, rapid technological advance is surely something to promote enthusiastically.\n\nYet many on the left tend to regard technological change with dread rather than hope. They see technology as a force facilitating inequality rather than growth, destroying jobs, especially for manual workers, turning consumers into corporate pawns rather than information-savvy citizens and destroying the planet in the process. We are far, far away from the traditional left attitude that welcomed technological change as the handmaiden of abundance and increased leisure - or, for that matter, from the liberal optimism that permeated the culture of the 1950s and '60s, the optimism that offered up tantalizing visions of flying cars and obedient robots.\n\nThe idea that we will face a jobless future seems to have particularly struck home. Martin Ford's 2015 book, Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future , which predicts half of US workers will be replaced by robots in the next 20 years, was widely and respectfully reviewed in liberal outlets. Coming after a spell of high unemployment attributable to the Great Recession and then to inadequate stimulus and misguided austerity policies (especially in Europe) - none of which have anything to do with robots - this seems like a very odd thing for those on the left to worry about. It is especially odd when the history of technological advance is full of transformations that put workers out of jobs in one sector only to have more jobs created in others as demand for new products and services grow.\n\nContinuing technological advance is unlikely to produce a future of no jobs. It will lead instead to a future of different and more highly skilled jobs. This is clearly the trend in the US economy, where the increasing share of jobs in offices and high-skill services (now almost two-thirds of employment) has replaced the declining share of jobs in industrial manual labor. Rather than bemoaning a chimerical disappearance of work, the left should seek to increase access to high-skill sectors of the economy, particularly in areas where the decline in low-skill industrial labor has significantly eroded the job base.\n\nConsider also that if robots were really displacing workers at a great rate, we should be seeing very rapid productivity increases (fewer workers, larger output). But we're not. In fact, productivity increases have been remarkably slow in recent years - 1.3 percent per year, just over a third of the rate in the late 1990s, when we had very strong employment growth and rising wages and incomes across the board.\n\nAnd remember that productivity increases - through technological advances or other means - are something the left should welcome and strive for. They are the source of rising living standards for the broad population. Rising living standards, in turn, create a favorable environment for left advancement.\n\nMany on the American left seem to miss this, but the world is getting to be a much better place. Since 1950 , the proportion of the world's citizens living in extreme poverty has declined from 72 percent to under 10 percent, while world life expectancy has increased from 48 years to 71. These remarkably positive changes have actually accelerated in the past 25 years, as globalization has intensified.\n\nRicher, healthier countries are great for the individual citizens of these countries, of course, but they are also great for the values and priorities of the left. Richer countries tend to provide more services to their citizens, educate a larger share of their population, and do a better job honoring human rights. They're also more democratic.\n\nOf course, it is true that globalization has had some negative effects - for example, on manufacturing jobs in developed countries - but these are exaggerated. The decline of industrial employment is a very long-run trend that predates the sharp rise in globalization toward the end of the last century. If you plot the share of manufacturing jobs in overall US employment since 1948, there has been a steady decline from a high of about 35 percent to less than 9 percent today . This decline can be traced to rapidly rising productivity in the manufacturing sector - the same output could be produced with fewer workers - combined with shifts in demand toward services, reflecting a rise in consumer affluence.\n\nAffluence (even of the American middle-class variety, not the Jeff Bezos variety) leaves more room in family budgets for non-necessities: 46 percent of consumption spending was on the basic necessities of food and clothing in 1947 compared with less than 18 percent today.\n\nThat's why the left will do a lot more good by advancing effective policies on growth, employment, and fiscal policy than by standing in the way of globalization. This is true even when it comes to jobs in the manufacturing sector. Germany, for example, has in recent year done far better than the US in managing its manufacturing job loss by retraining manufacturing workers from import-competing industries and moving them into export-oriented manufacturing jobs.\n\nIn short, globalization is not the villain many on the left make it out to be. A richer world is ultimately a better world, both for its citizens and for the goals of the left. The sensible response is not to denounce globalization but to make it work for as large a share of the population as possible.\n\nPerhaps no other subject generates as much angst on the left as global warming. That is not unreasonable: Climate change could do a stunning amount of economic and social damage and poses a serious threat to the future of the planet. If only we could replace dirty fossil fuel energy with clean energy from wind, solar, and other sources.\n\nBut wait! That's already happening. In fact, we're making dramatic progress in expanding the use of clean energy and dropping its price - which is the key to further expansion and eventually replacing dirty energy entirely.\n\nIn the past few years, even as fossil fuel prices have declined, world investments in clean energy, chiefly wind and solar, have reached levels that are double those for fossil fuel . Renewables now provide half of all new electric capacity worldwide . (And two-thirds in China, which has drastically cut its plans for new coal plants.) It's increasingly common, at least in some countries and some regions of the United States, for clean energy to be cost-competitive with fossil fuels.\n\nThe rapidity with which clean energy is becoming cheaper and more available is underappreciated. The cost of solar has fallen to 1/150th of its 1970s level , and the amount of installed solar capacity worldwide has increased a staggering 115,000 times. These exponential trends are hard to properly assess, even for those whose business it is to do so. For example, Ramez Naam, a US technologist and proponent of clean energy, posited in 2011 that solar power was following a kind of Moore's Law for energy. (Moore's Law projected that microchips would double in efficiency every two years.) Such efficiency gains would allow solar energy systems, which had by then fallen to about $3 a watt, to drop to only 50 cents a watt by 2030. However, Naam noted in the spring of 2015 that he had been way too conservative: Solar power systems by early 2015 had already hit the 50 cent mark.\n\nWind power, which tends to be complementary to solar power (the former best at night, the latter during the day), has been following a similar, if less steep trajectory. And, critically, energy storage, an essential complement to these more intermittent sources of energy, is also rapidly dropping in price and becoming more efficient. The price and efficiency improvement rates for battery storage have actually been faster than the corresponding (already high) rates for wind and solar over the same periods.\n\nMuch of this progress will continue even under the unhelpful administration of Donald Trump. China has bolted to the front of clean energy development and seems willing to play a leadership role in pushing the fight against climate change forward, regardless of Trump's attitude toward the 2015 Paris climate agreement.\n\nTrump may strive to eliminate Obama's Clean Power Plan, an effort that may take years, but the genie is already out of the bottle. Dozens of states, including the largest ones, are on track to meet the Clean Power Plan's 2030 targets for switching from coal to natural gas and renewables. They are unlikely to be deterred by Trump's actions, since energy utilities are largely regulated at the state level.\n\nAnd most of all, the development, deployment, and cheapening of clean energy will continue whether Trump likes it or not because of rapid technological advance, a continuing stream of new investment, and evolving consumer preferences. Then, when the left gets back in power, it can press the accelerator on this progress by investing in clean energy research and infrastructure, and it can reinstate the Clean Power Plan and other regulations.\n\nDemography may not be destiny but it's still hugely important. No matter what happened in the 2016 election, the fact that the Democrats' coalition relies on growing groups while the GOP's relies on declining ones is still a considerable advantage for Democrats. That advantage will only grow in coming years.\n\nNaturally, that advantage does not, by itself, determine election outcomes, as we have recently seen. It was always the case that if a declining group in the GOP coalition - think white non-college voters - intensified its pro-Republican preferences enough, that would mathematically be enough to negate the pro-Democratic effects of demographic change. That is what happened in the 2016 presidential race (with an assist from the Electoral College, which gives extra weight to states with high concentrations of white non-college voters).\n\nBut live by the white non-college swing, die by the white non-college swing. The utter dependence of the GOP on this voter demographic means that they need to not only maintain their extraordinary 2016 levels of support among these voters, they need to drive that support ever higher in future elections, to neutralize continued growth in the Democrats' coalition. That's a tough assignment.\n\nConsider how strong Democratic growth will be. The share of white non-college voters is dropping 3 points every presidential cycle , replaced by ever more minorities and college-educated voters. The growth of minorities is particularly striking. Right now, there are only four majority-minority states: California, Hawaii, New Mexico, and Texas. But the next two majority-minority states, Maryland and Nevada, should arrive in the next three years. After that, there should be four more in the 2020s: Arizona, Florida, Georgia, and New Jersey. In the 2030s, these states should be joined by Alaska, Louisiana, and New York - and in the 2040s by Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Virginia.\n\nLive by the white non-college swing voter, die by the white non-college swing voter\n\nBut perhaps nothing illustrates the ongoing shift in the political terrain better than the differences between younger and older generations. Right now, according to Pew data , the millennial generation identifies with Democrats by 54 percent to 33 percent over Republicans and Generation X by 48 percent to 37 percent. By comparison, baby boomers were 44 percent to 44 percent and the silent generation (those born from 1928 to 1945) preferred Republicans by 48 percent to 44 percent.\n\nTogether, millennials and Gen X-ers accounted for 57 percent of eligible voters in 2016, an advantage that was tamped down by the relatively higher turnout of older generations. But by 2024 , millennials and Gen X-ers, plus the emerging post-millennial generation, will constitute fully 68 percent of eligible voters. What's more, the millennials and Gen X-ers will have aged into much higher turnout years. Silents, the most conservative generation by far, will be down to a mere 7 percent of eligibles.\n\nSo the GOP is really walking a tightrope as they fend off these demographic changes while trying to extract ever more votes from white non-college voters, particularly older ones. The job of the left is to push them off that tightrope. It shouldn't be that hard, especially if Democrats can make even a small dent in the white non-college vote. Which brings us to...\n\nThe left should have the courage of their convictions on this one. Trump certainly exploited voter anger and, yes, racism to get elected. But he also promised to solve people's problems - with their health care, with their jobs, with their living standards, with their communities, with their children's prospects. He won't succeed. That's a huge opening for the left, including among white non-college voters.\n\nNowhere is that opening greater than on the issue of growth that leads to better jobs and higher living standards. The Democratic Party is more or less united around a programmatic approach to the economy that could actually produce such growth - an approach some of us call \" equitable growth .\" It pushes back on inequality, seeing current high levels as an active detriment to growth, and seeks to combine support and opportunity for the broad middle class with investments to make the economy more productive.\n\nThis includes universal pre-K, free access to two years and some four-year colleges, paid family leave, subsidized child care, higher minimum wages, a commitment to full employment, and robust investments in infrastructure and scientific research, especially around clean energy.\n\nThe GOP, in contrast, now harbors a cacophony of different economic approaches, from pure libertarianism to Trump's incoherent economic nationalism. Astonishingly, the one point of agreement of these approaches appears to be that inequality should be pushed even higher by increasing the flow of benefits to the rich. The idea that ratcheting up inequality will somehow lead to strong growth, better jobs, and higher living standards is substantively ludicrous - and not at all what Trump's working-class supporters had in mind. When it doesn't work, they will be upset.\n\nHow strong growth can be with a better approach is a matter of debate. Certainly, the 4 percent annual rate bandied about the Trump administration is fanciful. But, as Jason Furman, chair of Obama's Council of Economic Advisors, recently pointed out in Vox, we should \"do everything that [we] can for growth, because over time a few tenths of a percent really do matter \" And of course, the point is not just to grow faster but to better distribute that growth. The left's approach will do both.\n\nThe left should have confidence this approach is both feasible and important. In the end, solid growth with better distribution will both improve people's lives and make it vastly easier for the left to attain its priorities. Conversely, Trump will be punished when he fails to deliver economic improvements for his voters. He is an unusual politician, but he has not repealed the basic laws of politics.\n\nIt's time for the left to realize that pessimism is an absolutely terrible selling point - and to downplay that aspect of left self-presentation. If things were terrible yesterday, are worse today, and are likely to get even worse tomorrow, this does not motivate the typical person to engage in heroic struggle to change the world. It is more likely to make them cautious, guarded, and determined to hold onto what little they have. To the extent the left wallows in a slough of despond about the state of the world, it only manages to undercut its ability to mobilize ordinary people.\n\nOptimism, by contrast, mobilizes people. It allows people to raise their heads from the daily struggle for existence, envision something better, and believe it's actually possible to get there. That makes the project of joining together with others to make positive change seem worth the effort it typically entails.\n\nMany on the left insist that it is their job to highlight negative trends with as much theatricality as possible, since that is where the motivation for change will come from. But this confuses the motivations of left activists with the motivations of average citizens. It is absolutely true that most left activists are fundamentally motivated by what they see as wrong and unjust in contemporary social arrangements.\n\nBut this just isn't the way most people work . The typical American generally adopts a bifurcated view of their situation that does not comport well with the relentless pessimism of many leftists. On the one hand, most Americans do tend to believe that many things have changed for the worse - that the economy has been doing poorly, that long-term trends have hurt security for average families, that leaders just don't get it. On the other hand, these very same Americans believe that they are holding up their end of the economic bargain, that they are working hard and doing right by their families, that their story is one of achievement against the odds, not pessimism and despair. Left pessimism appeals to one side of Americans' outlook, completely missing the other.\n\nThe left should reject this approach. Leftists and liberals should promote instead a sense that positive change has been, is, and will continue to be possible. That will make it far easier to mobilize their fellow citizens.\n\nBesides, look at it this way: It is basically impossible to out-pessimism Donald \"American Carnage\" Trump.

      "text": "A new book suggests a path forward for Democrats. The left hates it.\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nCutting red tape is a social justice issue.\n\nby Eric Levitz\n\nWhen a Democrat contemplates their nation's biggest problems today, minimum lot sizes in suburban housing codes probably don't rank very high on the list.\n\nAfter all, the US president is a reality star turned insurrectionist , who's ordering investigations of his political enemies , subverting court orders , gutting entire federal agencies , and fomenting a global trade war. To many liberals, this may not feel like a moment for turning inward and sweating the details of blue America's permitting regulations.\n\nBut a new book asks Democrats to do precisely that. In Abundance , journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson catalog American liberalism's failures to deliver material plenty - the housing shortages that plague blue cities, the green infrastructure that congressional Democrats funded but then failed to actually build , the high-speed rail system that California promised but never delivered . Klein and Thompson argue that these disappointments have a common source: Since the 1970s, American liberals have been more concerned with obstructing harmful economic development than promoting the beneficial kind. Democrats have prioritized process over outcomes and favored stasis over growth, most notably through their support for zoning restrictions, stringent environmental laws, and attaching costly conditions to public infrastructure spending.\n\nTo revitalize American progressivism, they sketch an \"abundance agenda\": a series of regulatory reforms and public investment programs aimed at facilitating higher rates of housing development, infrastructure construction, and technological progress.\n\nKlein and Thompson speak for a broader faction of \"abundance liberals,\" which encompasses the Yes in My Backyard (YIMBY) movement, various pro-innovation think tanks, and scores of commentators. In addition to Abundance , the faction has recently produced two other books outlining its critique of American liberalism's evolution since the 1970s, Why Nothing Works by Marc Dunkelman and Stuck by Yoni Appelbaum .\n\nIt is surely true that blue states' governance failures are not this moment's most pressing crisis. But Democratic areas' inability to avert cost-of-living crises - or to build infrastructure on time and budget - is a political liability for the party. Such mismanagement has not only called liberals' competence into question, but also chased millions of people out of large blue states and into red ones over the past 10 years.\n\nCalifornia and New York have been shrinking while Florida and Texas have been growing - trends that will make it much harder for Democrats to win the Electoral College or Congress after the 2030 census. Disempowering an increasingly authoritarian GOP should be Democrats' top priority in 2025. But bringing abundant housing, energy, and infrastructure to blue states is conducive to that task. This makes Klein and Thompson's analysis politically relevant.\n\nNevertheless, not everyone on the left buys what they're selling. And Abundance has some real flaws.\n\nIn their concern with winning over progressive skeptics, Klein and Thompson sometimes elide the genuine tradeoffs between their vision and progressive ideology. For example, while they lament the stifling impact of various environmental regulations on housing and clean energy construction, they're cagey about precisely how, and how much, they want to change such laws. Rather than stating plainly that they're willing to reduce regulatory obstacles to fossil fuel infrastructure for the sake of abetting the build-out of renewables - a position Klein, who was a co-founder of Vox, has endorsed in his New York Times column - they argue that going into details about how environmental laws should be amended would be beside the point, since \"no individual law\" would solve all the problems they identify and \"What is needed here is a change in political culture, not just legislation.\" Such slipperiness may make Abundance more palatable to progressives, but also invites distrust.\n\nThis said, much of the left's criticism of abundance liberalism is off-base and unfair. One especially prominent charge is that the abundance agenda entails a retreat from the progressive movement's commitments to economic justice and equality. In this account, Klein and Thompson want Democrats to stop catering to the particular needs of poor and working-class Americans - through expansions of social welfare programs or labor regulations - and start concentrating on maximizing economic growth.\n\nThe New Yorker's Benjamin Wallace-Wells writes that the abundance movement views stagnation as a \" national emergency \" that requires \"liberals to sideline their quest for a Scandinavian-style social democracy.\" And he fears that the pursuit of Klein and Thompson's vision could yield a less equitable society.\n\nWallace-Wells nevertheless endorses some aspects of the abundance agenda. Other critics are less measured. Dylan Gyauch-Lewis argues in the American Prospect that abundance liberals prize \"growth above all,\" and that their ideology is merely a repackaging of \"free-market dogma.\"\n\nLikewise, The Baffler's Alex Bronzini-Vender derides the abundance agenda as a \"Koch-funded initiative\" aimed at \"reversing the Democratic Party's skepticism of neoliberal orthodoxy.\"\n\nThese criticisms are off-base in more ways than one.\n\nFirst, it's simply not true that Klein and Thompson call on liberals to abandon welfare state expansion or to pursue growth at all costs. They explicitly state that \"redistribution is important\" - their argument isn't that expanding the safety net is undesirable, but rather, that doing so is insufficient for maximizing ordinary Americans' living standards.\n\nFurther, Abundance argues that the federal government should play a larger role in managing the economy, so as to accelerate the development of socially valuable technologies and steer economic growth in an ecologically friendly direction. To say that Klein, Thompson, and other abundance liberals are free market dogmatists because they oppose some regulations is a bit like saying Joe Manchin is a Stalinist because he opposes Medicare cuts.\n\nBut those who critique the abundance agenda on egalitarian grounds are making a more fundamental analytical error: Combating regulatory obstacles to housing construction, infrastructure, and energy production is not just compatible with prioritizing the interests of working-class Americans; it is synonymous with that task. An economic system biased toward scarcity and stagnation is one that serves the already comfortable better than the disadvantaged.\n\nThe left's suspicions of abundance liberalism are understandable. On a variety of fronts, Klein and Thompson call for paring back rules and regulations that are coded as progressive, in the name of abetting faster economic development. The left is used to denouncing this general proposition.\n\nYet abundance liberals are not calling on Democrats to forsake genuinely progressive restrictions on production, such as the Clean Air Act or minimum wage, for the sake of maximizing GDP. Rather, they are imploring their party to judge regulations on the basis of results rather than vibes. Rules that ostensibly subordinate free markets to the public good - but actually undermine ordinary Americans' living standards - are not worth defending.\n\nSuch regulations fall into a few broad categories.\n\nOne consists of seemingly progressive - but ultimately counterproductive - mandates appended to public spending. In recent decades, liberals have gotten accustomed to using government-funded projects as vehicles for delivering \"wins\" (however minor or symbolic) to their coalition's myriad stakeholders. Yet as Democratic legislators multiply the number of different causes a discrete project is supposed to serve, they often undermine their policy's core purpose.\n\nSan Francisco's approach to public housing is one of Abundance 's signature examples of this phenomenon. The Golden Gate City suffers from one of the highest homelessness rates in the United States. Increasing the supply of publicly subsidized housing should therefore be one of its government's priorities.\n\nYet the city's public housing policy is not designed to maximize the number of affordable homes in San Francisco - but rather, to build some affordable homes, while promoting small businesses, signaling concern for disabled people, improving the aesthetic quality of the city's architecture, increasing employment among local construction workers, and furthering a wide array of other liberal causes.\n\nThe rules that San Francisco has attached to its affordable housing program may sound progressive on their face. The city reserves publicly subsidized housing contracts for small builders, in a bid to combat the power of big developers. It also requires public housing projects to pass a review by the Mayor's Office of Disability and the San Francisco Arts Commission, hire locally, buy power from the city's public utility, and meet a panoply of other criteria.\n\nBut each of these provisions increases the costs of construction. Prohibiting large contractors from building affordable homes leads to delays, as there are only so many small construction companies in the Bay Area and each has limited capacity, by definition. Ensuring that housing is accessible for the disabled is surely vital. Yet all housing projects in the United States must already be compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act; mandating an additional review by the San Francisco Mayor's Office just adds a redundant layer of bureaucratic processing. And while pretty buildings are preferable to the alternative, when thousands of San Franciscans are going unhoused, architectural aesthetics should take a backseat to rapidly growing the affordable housing stock.\n\nTaken together, these little rules add tens of millions of dollars to the price of every affordable housing project in the city. The typical publicly subsidized apartment building in San Francisco takes more than 6 years to build and costs more than $600,000 per unit. By contrast, a private philanthropy in the city recently erected 145 studio apartments for the chronically homeless in three years, at a cost of just $400,000 per unit. This efficiency is derived largely from the fact that privately funded housing projects don't need to comply with as many requirements as public projects do.\n\nSaying that San Francisco should cut red tape in its affordable housing program may sound like a conservative sentiment. But in its actual effects, that red tape is reducing the supply of affordable housing while reinforcing the impression that the government cannot build things as competently as the private sector. These do not seem like progressive outcomes.\n\nAbundance liberals tell a similar story about zoning restrictions.\n\nAmerican municipalities in general - and Democratic ones in particular - heavily restrict the types of housing that the private sector can build. It is illegal to construct anything but a detached single-family home on roughly 75 percent of America's residential land. Local laws add various other cost-increasing limitations on housing development, from large minimum lot sizes to parking mandates to design requirements.\n\nThe progressive case against restrictive zoning is straightforward: Affluent suburbs use single-family zoning to keep out working-class families, who might be able to afford an apartment in their municipalities but can't shoulder the expense of a large house with a yard.\n\nMore broadly, making it illegal to build multi-family housing in most of the country ensures scarcity. According to some estimates, America has 4.5 million fewer homes than its people require. This shortage increases the value of our nation's existing housing stock - which is good for homeowners and landlords but bad for renters. A policy that benefits those who own property at the expense of those who don't is regressive by any definition.\n\nMany progressives have accepted the force of this argument. But some further to the left still disdain the push to liberalize zoning laws. And their aversion to that project is not difficult to understand. The idea that one of America's biggest economic problems can be mitigated by loosening restrictions on free enterprise is ideologically unpalatable for many.\n\nBronzini-Vender's essay in The Baffler well illustrates many leftists' allergy to this argument. In it, he argues that abundance liberals are selling the public a fiction: Unleashing homebuilders from \"zoning regulations\" would increase Americans' living standards, since the \"private sector would supply more goods at lower costs- if only it could .\"\n\nHe suggests this simply is not plausible and \"betrays a deep misunderstanding of capitalist production\": Firms do not want prices to fall as that would erode their profit margins, so they will choke off production long before it starts substantially increasing affordability.\n\nThere are a few problems with this reasoning. The first is empirical. Capitalist production has, in fact, routinely yielded more goods at lower costs. Since 2000, the prices of durable consumer goods in the US have fallen by roughly 25 percent .\n\nAnd in the realm of housing specifically, zoning reforms have led to increased production and greater affordability . In Minneapolis, the lifting of various zoning restrictions in 2018 was followed by a surge in housing construction and a decline in the city's median rent: Adjusted for local earnings, a home in Minneapolis was 20 percent cheaper in 2023 than it had been in 2017. In New Zealand, the city of Auckland's experiment with zoning liberalization yielded similar results.\n\nThe second problem with Bronzini-Vender's argument is theoretical. It assumes that the only way capitalist competition can yield lower prices is by forcing companies to accept lower profit margins. And since developers do not want their profits to fall, he reasons that they will tacitly collude to limit housing production, irrespective of zoning laws.\n\nThis is not a sound economic analysis. If you reduce how much it costs to produce a unit of housing - by legalizing apartment buildings or eliminating expensive regulatory requirements - then developers can charge lower prices while keeping their margins constant.\n\nFurther, firms can outcompete each other on price - without forfeiting profitability - if they increase their productivity. Durable goods have not become cheaper over the past quarter century because manufacturers and retailers have become more altruistic or less profitable, but rather because they've increased the amount of stuff they can supply per worker hour. (Some of this productivity increase is the result of outsourcing production to low-wage countries, but much of it is from innovations in production and logistics.)\n\nThe National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires the federal government to draft statements analyzing the environmental impacts of its decisions. When the law was first enacted, these statements were as short as 10 pages. Today, the average one is 600 pages long.\n\nAs Klein and Thompson note, between 1935 and 1970, construction productivity steadily rose in the US. But over the past half-century, it has actually fallen. Zoning reform could plausibly reverse that trend by making it easier to mass produce sections of housing in factories, a process known as modular construction ; as is, in order to conform with housing regulations, builders typically need to construct homes almost entirely onsite.\n\nMere deregulation will not ensure universal housing affordability. It will never be profitable to provide housing to low-income people, in the absence of public subsidies. And the private sector is liable to underproduce housing for middle-income people as well. The government can help fill in these gaps by creating public developers , which build market-rate housing and then reinvest their proceeds into new construction (the left flank of the abundance movement has been popularizing the public developer model for years now).\n\nNevertheless, the private sector could produce far more housing than it does, were it not for regulatory restrictions. A freer housing market would therefore make America richer and more equal. This fact may make some progressives uncomfortable. But defending our favorite ideological abstractions should not take precedence over improving people's lives.\n\nMost controversially, abundance liberals argue that some environmental regulations are undermining shared prosperity, trust in government, and the green transition.\n\nTheir complaint is not with environmental laws that directly constrain pollution, such as the Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act. The issue lies primarily with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and its state-level equivalents. NEPA does not actually ban any pollutant or set any specific constraints on industrial production. Rather, the law mandates a process: Federal bureaucracies need to consider the environmental impact of their decisions, and draft statements outlining those impacts.\n\nAs Dunkelman explains, the law was intended merely to encourage government agencies to contemplate ecological concerns before greenlighting various projects, not to reduce their autonomy over such decisions. But activist lawyers took an expansive interpretation of the statute: In their view, if the government's environmental impact statement underestimated the ecological implications of a given project, then private citizens and community groups could sue to block that project in court. And a series of judicial rulings enshrined this interpretation of the law.\n\nMany states proceeded to draft their own versions of NEPA, some of which applied its requirements to private projects as well as public ones. The effect was to render economic development of all kinds slower and more expensive. To ward off litigation, governments were forced to make their environmental impact statements lengthy and exhaustive: When the law was first enacted, those statements were as short as 10 pages. In 2022, the average one ran 600 pages long and took four and a half years to complete.\n\nAnd once completed, those statements still need to make it through a legal gauntlet before the ground on a given project can actually be broken.\n\nAll this has made building infrastructure in the US radically more expensive. Between the 1960s and 1980s, the cost of building a mile of interstate highway in America tripled . Mass transit was similarly impacted. It cost New York $2.6 billion to construct each mile of its Second Avenue Subway. By contrast, at around the same time, social democratic Copenhagen built a rail line for just $323 million per mile, and Paris built one for $320 million per mile.\n\nNEPA and its state-level equivalents also inhibit housing construction: In Berkeley, California, locals delayed the building of new undergraduate dorms through a three-year-long lawsuit, in which they argued that the project violated the California Environmental Quality Act, since enabling more college students to live in Berkeley would increase noise pollution.\n\nThis state of affairs undermines trust in the public sector's competence, while making infrastructure and housing more expensive, raising tax burdens, and slowing economic growth.\n\nThe Democratic Party's complacency about these outcomes bespeaks an insensitivity to working-class priorities and interests. According to some leftwing narratives, Democrats took an ideological turn in the 1970s, one that led them to sacrifice the interests of blue-collar Americans to the pursuit of \"growth at all costs.\" But on some policy fronts, this gets the story backward. Democrats became less committed to economic growth in the seventies, largely because they started prioritizing educated middle-class people's ideological and quality-of-life concerns over the material interests of working people.\n\nThe environmental movement of the 1970s was overwhelmingly comprised of economically comfortable college graduates, many of whom regarded economic growth as undesirable and unsustainable , a position rejected by the vast majority of working-class voters. As political scientist Ronald Inglehart showed, blue-collar Americans were much less likely than their more affluent compatriots to prioritize environmental concerns over economic ones .\n\nAnd working-class voters' priorities were well-founded: The costs of a regulatory system biased toward stasis and scarcity are more burdensome for those who do not yet enjoy material security than for those who do. As civil rights icon and trade unionist Bayard Rustin lamented in 1976, \"the vanguard of the environmental movement , themselves members largely of the upper classes, have often sought policies that are clearly detrimental, and in some cases-the growth controversy being the most significant example-destructive to the needs of those less better off.\"\n\nMany of the environmental movement's achievements were laudable, and greatly improved and extended the lives of ordinary Americans. And the harms of NEPA aren't all attributable to earnest environmentalists: Well-heeled interests have exploited the law to obstruct all manner of economic development. Yet refusing to pare back the scope of NEPA and similar laws in light of such abuse was a choice - one that constrained economic opportunity and diminished the federal government's capacity to build public works.\n\nWhat makes NEPA and its ilk particularly perverse in the present moment, however, is that they are making America's greatest ecological challenge - climate change - more difficult to meet.\n\nThe reason for this is simple: Building a clean energy economy requires constructing gargantuan amounts of new infrastructure (vast solar installations, wind farms, transmission lines, and geothermal plants, among other things). Maintaining a carbon economy, by contrast, requires building scarcely any, since the existing energy system is built around the needs and capacities of fossil fuels. A regulatory regime that favors the status quo is therefore one that favors fossil fuels. As of 2021, NEPA reviews were holding up twice as many green projects as carbon energy ones . According to an analysis cited by Klein and Thompson, 95 percent of energy projects that are looking to connect to the grid - but which are as yet obstructed by permitting - consist of solar, battery storage, or wind power.\n\nPro-growth deregulatory policies are not sufficient for achieving shared prosperity. Indeed, such proposals aren't even adequate for realizing Klein and Thompson's vision for \"abundance,\" which also entails increasing government funding for technological development, among other things.\n\nBut loosening some regulatory restrictions on housing and infrastructure development would directly advance many progressive economic goals - while indirectly making it easier to expand the social welfare state. After all, higher economic growth translates into higher government revenues, which can then be redistributed to the economically disadvantaged. The abundance agenda is also compatible with increasing workers' bargaining power through sectoral bargaining (even as there exist some genuine conflicts between the narrow interests of discrete unions and the achievement of material plenty).\n\nAbundance is directed at a progressive audience and aimed at winning an argument internal to blue America. In the current moment, this may strike some readers as myopic. Even if all progressives decided tomorrow to prioritize making it easier for the federal government to do big things, Elon Musk would still be gutting its capacity to execute its most basic functions . Even if permitting issues weren't stymying the green transition, Donald Trump would be .\n\nAnd Klein and Thompson do not fully grapple with the challenge that the GOP's radicalization poses to their ambitions. Much of the abundance agenda is aimed at increasing the administrative state's power, at the expense of the judiciary's. This strikes me as indispensable for realizing liberalism's long-term goals. But today, it would entail giving Trump and Musk an even freer hand to reshape government to their reactionary whims.\n\nNevertheless, abundance liberalism remains relevant. The MAGA movement is not the reason why New York can't build enough housing , California can't build high-speed rail , and Massachusetts can't build a transmission line between its cities and Quebec's hydropower plants. Democrats have full control of government in some of America's largest and wealthiest states. They have the power to prove that they can deliver rising living standards and falling costs for ordinary people.\n\nThere are many reasons why blue states have had such limited success on these fronts. But one is that progressives have not mounted a unified front against zoning restrictions that help landlords gouge tenants, environmental laws that enable rich NIMBYs to block renewable energy, and liberal policies that seek to advance so many disparate priorities that they end up achieving none. With any luck, Abundance will bring us a little closer to such a consensus.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

And liberals don't seem to have a good defense.\n\nby Zack Beauchamp\n\nShortly after its post-World War I creation, the foundations of Germany's Weimar Republic began to quake. In 1923, Hitler staged an abortive coup attempt in Bavaria, the so-called Beer Hall Putsch - a failure that nonetheless turned Hitler into a reactionary celebrity, a sign of German discontent with the post-war political order.\n\nOne contemporary observer, a legal theorist in his mid-30s named Carl Schmitt, found the seeds of the crisis within the idea of liberalism itself. Liberal institutions like representative democracy, and the liberal ideal that all a nation's citizens can be treated as political equals, were in his view a sham. Politics at its core is not about compromise between equal individuals but instead conflict between groups.\n\n\"Even if Bolshevism is suppressed and Fascism held at bay, the crisis of contemporary parliamentarism would not be overcome in the least,\" he wrote in 1926. \"It is, in its depths, the inescapable contradiction of liberal individualism and democratic homogeneity.\"\n\nSchmitt's critique of liberalism proved terrifyingly accurate. The struggle between the Nazis and their opponents could not be resolved through parliamentary compromise; the Weimar Republic fell to fascism and took the rest of the continent down with it.\n\nI've been thinking about Schmitt a lot lately. Not about his dark fate - he became an enthusiastic Nazi - but instead about his prescience. Schmitt saw something in German politics, deep flaws in its liberal order, before they became obvious to other political observers and ordinary citizens. His philosophical critique predicted political reality.\n\nSchmitt haunts our political moment because we are seeing a flowering of criticism of American liberalism. In recent years, serious thinkers on both the left and right have launched a sustained assault on the United States' founding intellectual credo.\n\nThese criticisms do not arise in a vacuum. They stem from real-world crises, most notably the 2008 Great Recession and the rise of far-right populists like Donald Trump to power. These shocks to the system show, in the eyes of liberalism's contemporary critics, that something is profoundly wrong with the fundamental ideas that define our politics. It is a belief that \"the liberal idea has become obsolete,\" as Russian President Vladimir Putin recently declared .\n\nUnlike Schmitt and Putin, the intellectual critics of liberalism opponents do not typically challenge democracy itself. But they are united in believing that American liberalism as currently constituted is past its expiration date, that it is buckling under the weight of its contradictions. Their arguments tap into a deep sense of discontent among the voting public, a collapse of trust in the political establishment, and a growing sense that institutions like Congress aren't delivering what the public needs.\n\nOn the right, the anti-liberals locate the root of the problem in liberalism's social doctrines, its emphasis on secularism and individual rights. In their view, these ideas are solvents breaking down America's communities and, ultimately, dissolving the very social fabric the country needs to prosper.\n\nLiberalism \"constantly disrupts deeply cherished traditions among its subject populations, stirring unrest, animosity, and eventually political reaction and backlash,\" Harvard law professor Adrian Vermeule , one of the most prominent of the reactionary anti-liberals, said in a May speech.\n\nLeft anti-liberals, by contrast, pinpoint liberal economic doctrine as the source of our current woes. Liberalism's vision of the economy as a zone of individual freedom, in their view, has given rise to a deep system of exploitation that makes a mockery of liberal claims to be democratic - an oppressive system referred to as \"neoliberalism.\"\n\n\"Neoliberalism in any guise is not the solution but the problem,\" Nancy Fraser , a professor at the New School, writes. \"The sort of change we require can only come from elsewhere, from a project that is at the very least anti-neoliberal, if not anti-capitalist.\"\n\nThe defenses from America's liberal intellectual elite have been weak at best. The most prominent defenses of liberalism today are either laundry lists of its past glories or misplaced attacks on \"identity politics\" and \"political correctness,\" neither of which are adequate to the challenge presented by liberalism's newly vital critics on the reactionary right or socialist left.\n\nIf liberalism is to endure, liberals have to join the fight. And that starts with understanding why liberalism is in trouble - and just what, exactly, it's up against.\n\nFor a word that's so omnipresent, liberalism is notoriously difficult to define.\n\nIn the context of political philosophy , liberalism refers to a school of thought that takes freedom, consent, and autonomy as foundational moral values. Liberals agree that it is generally wrong to coerce people, to seize control of their bodies or force them to act against their will (though they disagree among themselves on many, many whys and hows of the matter).\n\nGiven that people will always disagree about politics, liberalism's core aim is to create a generally acceptable mechanism for settling political disputes without undue coercion - to give everyone a say in government through fair procedures, so that citizens consent to the state's authority even when they disagree with its decisions.\n\nThis foundational liberal vision is typically associated with a group of European and American thinkers - from John Locke in the 17th century to John Rawls in the 20th - and thus often treated as a Western political inheritance. But seeing liberalism as a product of a particular cultural tradition is a mistake.\n\nAs Amartya Sen argued in a brilliant 1997 essay , many of the core principles we identify with liberalism today - religious toleration, popular sovereignty, equal freedom for all citizens - can be found in writings from pre-modern Europe, the ancient Buddhist tradition, and a 16th-century Indian king, among a range of sources. Liberalism has taken root in diverse societies across the globe today, from Japan to Uruguay to Namibia.\n\nSen's paper suggests that instead of defining liberalism by books written by dead white men, it makes more sense to treat it as a set of parts: a grouping of principles and animating ideas that, when combined, add up to an overarching framework for understanding political life.\n\nOf these components, at least four political principles are common to the various species of liberalism (all of which relate to its core moral premise about freedom). They are familiar to most citizens in liberal regimes: democracy, the rule of law, individual rights, and equality.\n\nThese ideas - the minimalist core of liberalism - are so foundational to political life in advanced democracies that they're simply taken for granted, with debates about public policy taking place inside liberalism's parameters.\n\nBush-era American conservatism was a right-wing species of liberalism; what Americans call \"liberalism\" is a relatively modest form of left-liberalism. Germany's Christian Democrats, India's Congress, Cape Verde's PAICV, and Argentina's Republican Proposal are politically diverse parties, some more conservative by their country's standards and others more left-leaning, but they're all broadly liberal.\n\nTo challenge liberalism is thus to not merely engage in ordinary political argumentation. It is to call into question the entire operating system that defines the world's democracies. It is, by its nature, a radical claim.\n\nBut these are radical times. Several trends and shock events have combined to create a sense of rolling crisis. This certainly traces back to the Great Recession; arguably, it began as far back as the 9/11 attacks. But what's clear is that liberalism's peril became acute in 2016, when the twin shocks of Brexit and Trump proved that illiberal right-wing populism had emerged as a serious challenge to liberal hegemony.\n\nBy one count, illiberal right-wing populists controlled the governments of least 11 different countries in 2018; in 1990, they controlled none. Trump is the most famous example, but he has peers in countries as influential as Brazil and India. Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who has openly described his political vision as \"illiberal,\" essentially dismantled Hungarian liberal democracy ; Poland's ruling Law and Justice party is well on the way to doing the same . Combine these outright victories with the rising popularity of far-right parties in many other European countries, and it looks like liberalism is at risk of being overthrown by the voters that it's supposed to be serving.\n\nThe rise of such a challenge to liberalism has highlighted how the liberal status quo has failed to deliver, particularly in the wealthy West. Across the OECD , the top 10 percent makes over nine times per year as much as the bottom 10 percent. Metrics of trust in a range of governmental institutions - legislatures, courts, civil service - are falling across advanced democracies . In the United States specifically, deaths from alcohol abuse, drug overdose, and suicide have reached all-time highs .\n\nThese are just a few of the doleful indicators , numbers that paint a gloomy picture of the political status quo in liberalism's strongholds and especially the United States. If life under liberalism is getting worse for a lot of people, is it possible that the idea really has outlasted its usefulness?\n\nModern anti-liberals, both on the right and the left, take the notion that the status quo is broken as their starting point.\n\nThose on the left argue that liberalism's failures were eminently predictable, the inevitable product of contradictions within liberalism long identified by critics in the Marxist tradition - that between the liberal commitment to egalitarian democracy and a vision of the market as a zone of individual freedom.\n\nThe Indian essayist Pankaj Mishra captured this argument particularly well in an interview with the LA Review of Books :\n\nLiberal capitalism was supposed to foster a universal middle class and encourage bourgeois values of sobriety and prudence and democratic virtues of accountability. It achieved the opposite: the creation of a precariat with no clear long-term prospects, dangerously vulnerable to demagogues promising them the moon. Uncontrolled liberalism, in other words, prepares the grounds for its own demise.\n\nThe core concepts of the leftist narrative have been worked out for decades by Marx-influenced scholars like the University of Pennsylvania's Adolph Reed Jr. , the New School's Nancy Fraser , and the City University of New York's David Harvey . It's become prominent thanks to the emergence of vibrant leftist magazines like Jacobin and its adoption by prominent public intellectuals like Mishra.\n\nThe current crisis of liberalism, according to this narrative, dates to (roughly) the 1970s. Around then, governments across the Western world began deregulating their economies, selling off state-owned industries, and privatizing core government services. This turn towards economic \"neoliberalism,\" as leftists termed it, was not just a matter of economic policy, but rather a comprehensive ideological and philosophical project.\n\nUnder neoliberalism, the logic of the market becomes \"an ethic in itself, capable of acting as a guide to all human action, and substituting for all previously held ethical beliefs,\" Harvey writes in his book A Brief History of Neoliberalism . \"It has pervasive effects on ways of thought to the point where it has become incorporated into the common-sense way many of us interpret, live in, and understand the world.\"\n\nNeoliberalism, in this line of thinking, became dominant on both sides of the political aisle. Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher were neoliberals; so too were Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. Their agenda of tax cuts, \"welfare reform,\" and deregulation created the rapid increase in inequality since the 1970s , giving rise to a political and economic model rigged in favor of the rich.\n\nThe critique of neoliberalism is not new, but it has gained currency in the last decade or so. The Great Recession can be blamed on neoliberal financial deregulation , the Eurozone crisis on neoliberal austerity , and the rise of Trump and right-wing extremists as a backlash to neoliberal free trade agreements and neoliberal indifference to rising inequality .\n\n\"Here is what we need to understand: a hell of a lot of people are in pain. Under neoliberal policies of deregulation, privatisation, austerity and corporate trade, their living standards have declined precipitously,\" leftist author Naomi Klein writes in the Guardian . \"Donald Trump speaks directly to that pain. The Brexit campaign spoke to that pain. So do all of the rising far-right parties in Europe.\"\n\nNow, it's possible to oppose \"neoliberalism\" without opposing \"liberalism\" per se. But liberalism's left-wing critics disagree; they claim that neoliberalism is not a distortion of liberalism, but rather its true face.\n\nLiberalism's core error, in this view, comes from a mistake in its vision of democracy. Liberals support democracy as a matter of principle, believing that individuals have a right to shape decisions that affect their lives in deep and important ways. But liberals curiously excludes parts of economic life from this zone of collective self-determination, seeing the market as a place where people have individual but not collective rights. Liberalism sees nothing wrong with the heads of Amazon and Facebook making decisions that have implications for the entire economy.\n\nSo long as capitalists are free from democratic constraint, leftists argue, liberal democracy is on dangerous footing. The super-rich use the power their accumulated wealth provides to influence political life, rearranging policy to protect and expand their fortunes. The rise of neoliberalism is, per the socialist writer Peter Frase , this process in action: proof that capitalism will invariably corrupt liberalism's promise of freedom and equality.\n\nFor all their anti-liberal rhetoric, virtually none of today's serious left critics of liberalism are Stalinists or Maoists - that is, opponents of democracy itself. They believe in liberal rights like freedom of expression, and pursue their revolutionary agenda through social organizing and democratic elections.\n\nThey champion Sen. Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign, despite the fact that the policies he advocates stop well short of democratizing the workplace or abolishing capitalism. That's because they see the electoral victory of an avowed \"democratic socialist\" and policies like Medicare for All as the beginning of a long process, necessary steps for replacing eventually capitalism with something better.\n\nMany of the sharpest left-wing critics of liberalism do not frame themselves as opponents of liberal democratic ideals. Rather, they argue that they're the only people who can vindicate liberalism's best promises.\n\n\"In describing my own political trajectory, I often talk about my parents' liberal politics, and my own journey of discovery, through which I concluded that their liberal ideals couldn't be achieved by liberal means, but required something more radical, and more Marxist,\" Frase writes . \"That's what I'd call socialism, or even communism , which for me is the ultimate horizon.\"\n\nThe right's attack on liberalism is even more sweeping than the left's.\n\nConservative anti-liberals question not only freedom in the economic sphere, but the value of pluralistic democracy itself - arguing that core liberal ideals about tolerance and equality actually produce an insidious form of tyranny that destroys communities and deadens the human spirit.\n\nThe key proponents of this view are heavily (though not exclusively) Catholic; many draw from their faith's long tradition of anti-liberal thought. They have a small presence in the academy - Notre Dame political theorist Patrick Deneen and Harvard legal scholar Adrian Vermeule, for example - but are much less visible in the professoriate than socialists.\n\nThe right-leaning anti-liberals are more often found in the punditry, conservative think tanks, and even in the ranks of actual political parties (particularly in Europe). The Christian publication First Things is a particular hub of media activity for these anti-liberals, as is the American Conservative magazine. Sympathetic writers can be found at outlets ranging from the New York Times to National Review to the New York Post . Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) is a conservative anti-liberal; on the far right, anti-liberals include Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and Polish European Parliament member Ryzard Legutko.\n\nThe right's starting point is the same as the left's: our society is in dire straits, and liberalism is to blame. Like the left, they see the untrammeled market as part of the problem, a decisive break with the libertarianism or \"classical liberalism\" favored by traditional American movement conservatives and European right-wingers in the mold of Margaret Thatcher . The economic split has produced more than a little infighting in conservative ranks.\n\nBut conservative anti-liberals are not content with rubbishing libertarianism and other liberal economic doctrines. The real error, in their view, goes even further back - all the way down to liberalism's core ideas about individual freedom and choice.\n\nLiberalism's foundational premise is that the government must defend liberty: that people should be free to choose their paths in life, and that the state's role should first and foremost be protecting and enabling the exercise of this freedom. Conservative critics believe this basic liberal picture is rooted in a false, impoverished view of human life - there is not, and never has been, such a thing as freely choosing, autonomous individuals.\n\nActual people are embedded inside social relations and identities - most notably, family, faith, and community - without which they lack meaning and purpose. Liberalism elevates the will of the individual at the expense of these pre-political bonds.\n\n\"For decades now our politics and culture have been dominated by a particular philosophy of freedom,\" Hawley writes in an essay published by Christianity Today . \"It is a philosophy of liberation from family and tradition, of escape from God and community, a philosophy of self-creation and unrestricted, unfettered free choice.\"\n\nThe pursuit of profit erodes social ties, creating incentives for people to pursue their self-interest rather than build families or embed themselves in communities. Young people leave their small towns in search of career and meaning in anonymous big cities, destroying the communal ethos that allowed people to feel happy and secure. Rising inequality chips away at the bonds of social solidarity, hollowing out the middle class and placing deep barriers between citizens.\n\nLiberals use the state to try and address the market's failures, providing services like welfare payments and health care. But such efforts, conservatives argue, usurp functions that used to belong to community and church - further weakening those key sources of meaning and identity.\n\n\"The political project of liberalism is shaping us into...increasingly separate, autonomous, non-relational selves replete with rights and defined by our liberty, but insecure, powerless, afraid, and alone,\" Deneen, probably the sharpest of these conservative anti-liberals, writes in his book Why Liberalism Failed .\n\nThis destruction of community, conservative anti-liberals believe, can be seen in the big-picture numbers. Across liberal societies, religious attendance has fallen, social clubs like the Elk Lodge are declining, divorce rates have risen, and birth rates are shrinking. Liberalism's separation of individual from community and security leaves its subjects angry and alone, turning to demagogues because no one else is channeling their rage at a failing status quo.\n\nBut what has really set off reactionary anti-liberals has been the state enforcement of liberal social mores.\n\nThey believe that liberalism's vaunted neutrality - its claim to respect all citizens' freedom to follow their own paths in life - is a sham. Liberalism can only truly tolerate belief systems that cohere with its vision of freedom, and will actively attempt to stamp out worldviews that it concludes are hostile to that ideal. In the right anti-liberal imaginary, liberal tolerance is fundamentally intolerant.\n\nHence attempts to force Hobby Lobby's insurance to cover birth control and Christian bakers to make cakes for gay weddings . Hence the rise of \"political correctness\" and the LGBT movement's attempts to challenge the allegedly foundational concept of the gender binary. Eventually, these conservatives believe, liberalism's quest to make everyone free could culminate in wiping out traditional Christianity and conservative society altogether.\n\n\"The need for building a liberal-democratic society ... implies the withdrawal of the guarantee of freedom for those whose actions and interests are said to be hostile to [liberalism],\" Legutko, the Polish member of European Parliament, writes in his influential book The Demon in Democracy .\n\nSo if liberalism is a mortal threat to the West, what's the right-wing alternative?\n\nThere are, broadly speaking, two schools of thought: localism and nationalism.\n\nThe localist view, advocated by Deneen and the American Conservative's Rod Dreher, suggests that national politics should not be the focus of anti-liberals' energy (at the moment, at least). They advocate instead focusing on engaging in small-scale experiments and community building that can restore what liberalism has destroyed, providing islands of stability for traditional Christians amid the secular storm raging nationwide.\n\n\"Such communities of practice will increasingly be seen as lighthouses and field hospitals to those who might have once regarded them as peculiar and suspect,\" Deneen writes. \"From the work and example of alternative forms of community, ultimately a different experience of political life might arise.\"\n\nThe nationalist view, by contrast, argues for recapturing the state and remaking it on avowedly illiberal lines - constructing a state that rebuilds national communities by opposing international capital and secular liberalism alike.\n\nThe Orbán government in Hungary is an example of this agenda in action. Hungary's leader has banned the teaching of \"gender ideology\" in universities, cracked down on non-European immigration, passed financial incentives aimed at getting Hungarian women to have more babies, and redefined Hungary's regime as both as a \"Christian democracy\" and an \"illiberal democracy.\"\n\nAn even more radical version, advocated most prominently by Harvard's Vermeule, is something called \"integralism\" - an obscure Catholic doctrine that essentially amounts to the abolition of the church/state distinction and the replacement of liberal democracy with an avowedly Catholic regime .\n\nThese integralists reject the label of \"theocracy\" for their ideal government. But they do hope the current system can be transformed from within, the ultimate aim being a state that promotes a religiously defined \" Highest Good \" rather than liberal autonomy.\n\nVermeule specifically \"hopes for eventual integration effected from within institutions,\" starting by influencing of \"executive-type bureaucracies\" rather than through outright winning elections. It's a way of shaping the future, of laying the groundwork for a Catholic world after \"liberalism's eventual disappearance.\"\n\nDespite all of its problems, I still believe in liberalism. Its core philosophical doctrines are correct: The aim of politics should be ensuring individuals are free to live according to their \"plan of life\" (a term taken from John Rawls , the liberal philosophical giant of the 20th century). Core liberal institutions, like an expansive slate of individual rights and a social democratic mixed economy, are vital to human flourishing.\n\nBut despite my deep faith in liberalism, I've recently found myself more frustrated by reading fellow liberals than the illiberals attacking us.\n\nMany modern liberals, including some brilliant and well-regarded thinkers, do not seem up to the task of defending liberalism from its newest wave of critics. They lean on old arguments persuasive largely to other liberals, doing little to counteract the narrative of crisis from which the new illiberalism gets its force. It feels like the liberalism we have is musty, grown soft from its Cold War victory and unwilling to grapple with an opposition very different from what came before it.\n\nThe first of these unsatisfying arguments, which I associate most closely with Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker, is that the narrative of a world in crisis is simply wrong. On every conceivable metric, the world is getting better - extreme poverty is declining, life expectancy is going up, deaths from war and violence are on the decline. If things are generally doing well, where's the need for radical change?\n\nI happen to find the data behind this view persuasive, and indeed have argued that it's a compelling case for cautious optimism about humanity's future. It's not, however, a particularly good defense of liberalism at the moment.\n\nMost of the current global improvement is happening in the developing world; the biggest recent jumps in global life expectancy largely come from these countries, including authoritarian states like China. By contrast, conditions in richer liberal democracies are getting worse on a bevy of different metrics. The data on global improvement is hardly making the case for liberalism in its historical bastions.\n\nEven if you buy that liberalism is responsible for improvements for people living in the developing economies, it's not clear if it can keep this progress going. The damage done by our new demagogues and the looming threat of climate change could end up reversing worldwide progress against untimely death and poverty.\n\nBut most fundamentally, liberalism's defenders need to meet people where they are. And Pinker's metrics notwithstanding, a lot of people really feel like the political status quo is failing them. The illiberals are explaining why that is; liberals are trying to talk them out of it. This won't work, no matter how many statistics on infant mortality in sub-Saharan Africa liberals marshal.\n\nThe second unsatisfying liberal argument is that liberalism may not be perfect, but it has a long history of repairing itself. This is one of the central arguments in Adam Gopnik's A Thousand Small Sanities , the New Yorker correspondent's book-length defense of his liberalism.\n\n\"The liberation of women, the emancipation of slaves and then of the racially oppressed, the recognition of the rights of sexual minorities - these are all the unique achievements of liberal states, engineered by liberal activists, all things that have never happened before in history,\" Gopnik writes.\n\nBut saying that liberalism can repair itself isn't the same thing as explaining how it can do so right now. The victory of the suffragettes is cold comfort for women fighting for equal pay; claiming that liberalism abolished Jim Crow does nothing to tell us how it will fix the new Jim Crow . Gopnik's argument is more of a testament of faith in liberalism rather than an effort to chart a way through the current crisis.\n\nThe third and final unsatisfying liberal response, the one that frustrates me the most, is lashing out at the wrong enemies.\n\nOne of the most common genres in modern American punditry is the attack on \"identity politics\" and \"political correctness.\" Liberalism's defenders on both the center-left and center-right frequently pinpoint today's young people and college kids, with their \"trigger warnings\" and \"safe spaces\" and gender-neutral pronouns, as being a looming threat to free speech and core liberal values - the tip of a spear aimed at the multicultural left.\n\nBooks like The Once and Future Liberal , Columbia professor Mark Lilla's post-Trump opus, argue for a need to move beyond \"identity liberalism\"; liberal essayists warn that practitioners of \"identity politics\" are corroding the soul of American liberalism.\n\n\"The modern far left has borrowed the Marxist critique of liberalism and substituted race and gender identities for economic ones,\" Jonathan Chait wrote in a 2015 New York magazine feature. \"While politically less threatening than conservatism (the far right still commands far more power in American life), the p.c. left is actually more philosophically threatening. It is an undemocratic creed.\"\n\nBut there is scant persuasive evidence that America's young left-wing activists are turning against free speech or other core liberal values. The argument also betrays a misunderstanding of the relationship between identity politics and Marxism , as well as an underestimation of the degree to which right-wing anti-liberalism has become a part of the modern Republican Party.\n\nMost importantly, the liberal war on identity politics is a mistake philosophically. It misunderstands the rising energy surrounding identity issues as a threat to liberalism when it's actually sowing the seeds of liberal renewal.\n\nOne of liberalism's historical sources of strength is seeing the world for what it is, adapting its doctrines to fit changing realities rather than trying to make the world fit an older version of liberalism. Modern liberals need to do the same with the problems raised by its current critics. They - we - need to recognize that there are serious flaws in liberalism as it exists. Leftists are correct that neoliberal faith in the market was far too devout; conservatives are right that liberals have been too inattentive to the importance of community.\n\nBut liberal adaptation to change is not merely a process of self-flagellation. It also involves identifying what new ideas are bubbling up that can be adapted to strengthen liberalism, pinpointing the raw materials for generating enthusiastic new liberal movements and visions. The obsessive focus on a handful of overeager college organizers and professors is a mistake; it obscures the undeniable fact that organization around group identity has helped create a number of vital political movements that are defending liberalism's central component parts.\n\nThink about the Movement for Black Lives, dedicated to liberal ideals of equal citizenship and non-coercion. Think about the fact that roughly 4 million Americans around the country turned out for the 2017 Women's Marches, using a call for women's equality as means of organizing against Trump's threat to American democracy more broadly.\n\nThink about the #MeToo movement's role in fighting back against a pervasive source of unfreedom and inequality. Think about the backlash to Trump's travel ban and family separations, how young people around the world are using their generational identity to mobilize around climate change, and how laws aimed at repressing minority voters have become a rallying cry for the defense of free and fair elections .\n\nThe people doing the work to defend equality, freedom, and democracy today base their activism on the experiences of specific identity groups. They tend to use specific oppressions as a jumping-off point, weaving together different groups' experiences into a tapestry of solidarity.

The announcement came just two days after he signed an alternative trade pact with Cuba and Venezuela, and the bold move is sure to anger both President Bush and private energy companies that do business in the Andean nation.\n\nMorales immediately ordered soldiers to occupy Bolivia's gas fields, and he told energy companies operating in the country that they have six months to hand over majority control of their holdings to his government.\n\nBolivia has South America's second-largest natural gas reserves and those companies affected by the announcement include such major producers as Britain's BG Group and U.S.-based Exxon Mobil. Multinational corporations last year produced 100 million cubic feet of natural gas in the country and now they are expected to hand over 82 percent of their production to the Bolivian government. The companies are being allowed to keep 18 percent, only because the Bolivians are unable to tap all of its natural gas on its own.\n\nMorales, a leftist, won Bolivia's presidency in part by lashing out against foreign corporations, saying his country's natural resources had been looted by these companies. Bolivia is South America's poorest country and poverty remains a large factor in its politics.\n\nThis past weekend, Morales met with Presidents Chavez of Venezuela and Castro of Cuba to denounce the United States and its trade policy in the region, which these leaders say hurt the poor of the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nThe announcement Monday by Morales is one more attempt to redistribute the region's wealth, and the summit was one more attempt to stall U.S. free trade agreements with countries in the region. The United States has signed nine such agreements with Latin American countries.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Husband of CNN's Dana Loesch not targeted by leftists on Twitter, evidence suggests\n\n&#151; -- Chris Loesch, the husband of CNN contributor Dana Loesch , is a Twitter victim. That much is certain. The question is whether his tormentors are a nefarious horde of liberal tweeters or a benevolent algorithm that snared him accidentally.\n\nHere's what we know: Rebecca Hains, an assistant professor of communications at Salem State University in Massachusetts, tweeted a link at 5:10 p.m. ET on Sunday evening to an account of a Twitter dustup she had with Dana Loesch, a conservative commentator. The two had mixed it up over the politics of birth control, and Hains accused Loesch of distorting facts and sensationalizing her comments.\n\nThe tussle would have gone unnoticed had it not been spotted by Daniel Barber, a Bay Area freelance writer and Twitter bomb-thrower who goes by @DBarberHotnuke . (His profile picture is of a mushroom cloud.) After retweeting Hains' post , he went on to offer a few choice comments about Loesch, an affiliate of the late conservative publisher Andrew Breitbart:\n\n@dloesch is one of the few women on this planet that if I learned she'd been brutally raped and murdered I wouldn't shed a tear. @DBarberHotnuke at 7:40 pm\n\nAfter some scattered pushback, Barber elaborated:\n\nAnd that's not to mean I'm advocating @dloesch be raped and murdered, but simply that I wouldn't shed a tear if it happened. @DBarberHotnuke at 7:41 pm\n\nNo one ever said Twitter was civil. A half-hour later, Loesch's husband, Chris Loesch, dutifully responded:\n\n. @DBarberHotnuke I wish the liberal internet tough guys that were so cavalier in their wish for harm on @dloesch would grow souls. @ChrisLoesch at 8:16 pm\n\nDana Loesch says she regularly receives hate mail, and usually her husband ignores it. This time he decided to respond. \"When people are really rude, you can only look the other way so many times,\" he told Yahoo News. \"You need to sometimes remind them people are watching.\"\n\nChris Loesch posted nearly 50 tweets in the next 45 minutes , retweeting messages from supporters and responding to others who he felt were maligning his wife. Around 9 p.m. on Sunday, Twitter suspended his account.\n\nSeveral conservative sites arrived at the conclusion that Chris Loesch was the target of a coordinated campaign of liberals who reported his account as abusive . \" He was apparently targeted by leftist users who utilized the 'Block & Report Spam' function to trigger the social media account's automatic spam algorithm,\" one Washington Times blogger wrote. Human Events, a less obliquely conservative outlet, called the campaign the work of \"digital brown shirt gangs that make coordinated attacks to silence conservative voices by abusing Twitter's spam flagging feature .\" Supporters started a #FreeChrisLoesch hashtag. After he was briefly reinstated later that night and then summarily uninstated, the tag was appended to #FreeChrisLoeschAgain.\n\n• Bob McDonnell to campaign with Mitt Romney in Virginia this week: Another VP tryout?\n\n• Marco Rubio joins long list of pols-including past vice presidential candidates-fined by FEC\n\n• Sen.

      "text": "OPINION: To stop extremist hate and violence, we have to look within ourselves\n\nWe each must step up in our own circles.\n\n&#151; -- Though I may have reached the pinnacle of what many consider power and prominence -- working to elect and re-elect a President, regular meetings in the White House and trips on AirForce One -- I came to understand late in my ambitious life that the greatest power we can have is in the small circles of our own worlds.\n\nHate and violence has no place in the world, or our own worlds. It doesn't matter which ideology or dogma you are advocating, if it includes discrimination and extreme words or actions, it is misguided and wrong.\n\nThe problem today is that many people claim one tribe and point to the other tribes as the \"really bad ones.\" Yes, we need to push back strongly when groups such as white supremacists and neo-Nazis advocate a hate-based ideology and members intimidate with violence or the threat of violence. Absolutely that must be clearly and unequivocally denounced, with no moral equivalence. President Trump failed this simple test in the aftermath of Charlottesville.\n\nHowever, I have noticed that the \"right\" often says that the real problem in America is leftist radicals or radical Islamic terrorists . The \"left\" often points the finger at radicals on the right or extremist Christians as the underlying issue. Some Muslims say it is the Christians' fault, Christians say it is Muslims who are instigating fear and violence and on it goes.\n\nObjective data shows that numerous incidents of violence in America have been caused by extremists from all these groups over the last decade. None of the groups that have promoted violence as a solution is innocent.\n\nWe can argue about how much is caused by one or the other, but those arguments are not going to fix the problem. Our leaders should allocate resources to combat violence based on facts. Right now we are over-allocating resources towards violence by radical Islam and far under-allocating resources toward white nationalist hate groups. But again, political leaders won't solve this problem with money and manpower alone.\n\nThe real solution to this moral crisis is to step up in our own circles and clean our own houses before we point the finger across the street. It is well past time for the \"right\" to work on ridding its side of extremists who divide, hate and push tactics detrimental to our country. Muslims should be the first line of accountability for mopping up the corruption of their faith by radical extremists. Christians should confront Christians who preach a Gospel of hate, which is far removed from the way of Christ. And the left must push back on radical leftists who threaten others with violence.\n\nThere is a minority in each tribe who advocates violence and hate, and it is imperative the leaders in those tribes deal with their \"own\" first. The violence in Ireland was finally stopped when peaceful Irish people of virtue stood up and said \"enough.\"\n\nAs a Christian, my first job is to point out the hypocrisy and moral corruption of those who carry my own religious banner. As someone in the news media, I should try to clean up that circle as best I can and push for more pursuit of truth and a common set of facts, and towards greater independence from partisan leanings. We in the media must hold those in power accountable, whether wearing a red or blue jersey, and insist that our job is to tell the truth as best we can.\n\nAs Americans, we must start with confronting where we have fallen down before we find an international enemy to blame, or worse, to engage in war. We have ideals as citizens of the United States that we haven't met, and we must address those first, as an unequivocal beginning.\n\nUntil we move away from the \"yes we have problems, but look how bad the other side is\" mentality, we will never heal this country. Before we talk about what other clans need to do, let us each use our moral authority to address the problems within our own political and life circles. It is in those smaller circles that we can have the most power to affect real change.\n\nSo when somebody on the right tells me we need to focus on the left or on Islam, I am going to ask \"What are you doing about right wing extremists?\" And I will do the same to those on the left. And the same to Christians. And to Jews. And to Muslims. It is now a moment for us to remove the weeds in our lawn, and by doing that, we can put pressure on others to look at the grass in their yards. To me, it is the only way out of this morass.\n\nWill you join me?\n\nMatthew Dowd is an ABC News analyst and special correspondent.

      "text": "Democratic Socialist surge sparks dissent on left over electoral strategy\n\nMore moderate Democrats are skeptical.\n\nIf the socialist left -- not long ago considered a fringe movement -- seems as if it's lately been bargaining from a position of power, it might be due to a recent flood of support: since 2016, the ranks of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) have swelled from 6,000 to over 45,000 dues-paying members.\n\nAsked whom the DSA would endorse in the 2020 presidential election, Maria Svart, its national director, told ABC News that she can't predict which candidate the group will support -- members vote democratically on endorsements -- but she doubts her organization would back a candidate any less ardently leftist than Sen. Bernie Sanders , himself a Democratic Socialist.\n\n\"Our members are not interested in half-measures,\" Svart told ABC News.\n\nHer uncompromising stance contrasts sharply with the more moderate base of the Democratic party, which, some Democratic leaders say, is eager to rally around a candidate who stands a better chance against President Trump.\n\nMatt Bennett, senior vice president of center-left think tank Third Way, told ABC News he thinks a \"happy warrior, someone who is unafraid to stand up directly to Trump, to hit him square in the nose\" would be \"the best bet for the party going forward.\"\n\nBut when it comes to which candidate Third Way will support for president, \"the real answer is, whoever is nominated to run against Trump,\" Bennett said. \"We'll work with anyone who wants to work with us.\"\n\nBennett's Third Way represents the more moderate flank of the 2018 Democratic Party, which has found itself split as a socialist-leaning left wing scores electoral victories and begins to build a coalition.\n\nThe DSA's member surge began during the 2016 presidential race, and spiked again when card-carrying Democratic Socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez scored an upset victory over Democratic party heavyweight Joe Crowley in New York.\n\nOn the heels of Ocasio-Cortez's win, she and other Democratic Socialists have thrust left-wing proposals into the spotlight, turning a push to abolish the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) from a Twitter hashtag into proposed legislation and popularizing bold economic demands like Medicare for All.\n\nAs socialists move into the mainstream of political discourse, Democrats and political heavyweights have wrestled with how to respond.\n\nThe 'socialist left' wouldn't appeal to 'America's great middle,' former FBI director James Comey wrote on Twitter. \"Democrats, please, please don't lose your minds and rush to the socialist left,\" he cautioned.\n\nBeyond ideological differences with Democrats, however, DSA members argue that tailoring progressive proposals to be more politically-palatable makes for poor electoral strategy.\n\n\"Democrats argue that they're concerned about electability in the coming election, but the reality is, they failed in 2016, and 46 percent of people don't bother to vote,\" Svart told ABC News.\n\nMany leftists argue that truly purple 'swing voters' are few and far between, and believe that in order to flip districts, the left should focus on Americans disillusioned with politics as usual.\n\nModerate Democrats remain skeptical of the DSA's radicalism, however, arguing that too many leftist proposals are just political non-starters.\n\nGearing up for midterms, Democrats re-branded on bread-and-butter issues\n\nWhen Democrats unveiled their messaging re-brand in 2017, economic concerns were front and center.\n\n\"President Trump campaigned on a populist platform, talking to working people,\" Sen. Chuck Schumer told ABC News in an interview on the new platform. \". That's why he won.\"\n\n\"The No. 1 thing we did wrong is not present a strong, bold economic agenda to working Americans,\" he said.\n\nThough the party has converged on messaging geared toward working Americans, many DSA members doubt that Democrats share their vision for radical economic populism.\n\nDemocratic party leaders tout economic populism as a 'big tent' strategy -- one that includes wealthy urban professionals alongside union workers -- whereas the DSA defines its economic populism not only according to whom it attracts, but whom it excludes: socialists are not only for the working class, but explicitly pitted against the ruling class.\n\n\"Socialists view the world as being divided between two fundamental groups of actors: people who work, and people who get the credit for the work of others,\" Svart told ABC News.\n\nA growing movement to reject corporate campaign funding, led by progressive organizations such as Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress (both groups that backed Ocasio-Cortez), also stresses that the aim is not only ensuring particular candidates aren't beholden to individual corporations, but building broad-based resistance to the donor class.\n\nDemocrats have increasingly adopted left-wing rhetoric in discussing economic proposals -- in the same interview on The Week, Schumer repeatedly invoked a classic Bernie Sanders-ism, \"the system is rigged.\" But Schumer and other party leaders steer clear of terms like 'ruling class,' more often designating the Trump administration as progressives' common adversary.\n\n'Identity politics' includes class identity\n\nIn 2016, then-candidate Bernie Sanders predicted that disagreement in the Democratic Party over \"whether we go beyond identity politics\" would deepen and become fault lines on the left.\n\n\"It is not good enough for somebody to say, 'I'm a woman, vote for me'... What we need is a woman who has the guts to stand up to Wall Street, to the insurance companies, to the drug companies, to the fossil fuel industry,\" Sanders said on WBUR.\n\nSanders anticipated a concern increasingly voiced on the left: candidates might rely on belonging to an underrepresented identity group in order to vie for the progressive vote, without advancing a truly left-wing platform.\n\nSvart pointed to President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton as examples of politicians who only tenuously support the identity-based interests they claim to represent. Clinton campaigned as a feminist but did little to advocate for working-class women, Svart said, while Obama was nicknamed \"deporter-in-chief\" by immigration advocates who had once hoped the former president's race would make him a natural ally.\n\nOn this view, Democrats' deliberation over whether to focus on recapturing the vote of the 'white working class' or focus on attracting groups such as African-American, Latino or LGBTQ voters turns out to be a false choice. Democratic Socialists argue that a platform of radical economic justice proposals would galvanize a diverse coalition of Americans over shared economic interests -- a more promising electoral strategy than the lukewarm pluralism invoked to corral a \"big tent.\"\n\n'Faux progressives'\n\nSvart told ABC News that since Ocasio-Cortez's victory, she has noticed more \"faux progressive\" candidates invoking left-wing rhetoric but lacking sufficiently radical platforms.\n\n\"Politicians are opportunists, and organizers are also opportunists,\" she said. \"So, people wanting to adopt the name Democratic Socialist or talk about Medicare-for-All simply means that they've recognized that there is a base behind it.\"\n\n\"To me,\" she said, \"that means that we've been successful in building something that people want access to. But of course people are going to try to co-opt it - that's the way politics works.\"\n\nSvart cautioned progressives contemplating running on the left: \"We welcome it, but they should remember that our base cares about policy, not platitudes.\"\n\nThis is not a new concern for the DSA, which has long been skeptical of having its radical proposals co-opted by mainstream politics.\n\nHowever, Svart says that as the organization gains new attention Democratic Socialists have doubled down on remaining bold and uncompromising, emphasizing political education and worker organizing at local chapters.\n\n\"We have a vision which is broader than just electoral politics; we believe in building a working-class movement. It's not just about election cycles, it's about asserting your rights collectively, and that's the only way we can prevent things from being watered down,\" Svart said.\n\nContingent alliance with Congressional Progressive Caucus\n\nThe DSA is not a monolith and local chapters see spirited disagreement over both theory and strategy, but Democratic Socialists ultimately envision an end to capitalism, which they critique as fundamentally crisis-prone and unjust.\n\nIn the short run, they are pursuing a platform that has been erroneously equated with New Deal or Great Society liberalism. Although Democratic Socialists push for union organizing, scaled-up social benefits and universal health care, they also insist that welfare state progressivism is ultimately insufficient.\n\n\"Socialists work for reforms that weaken the power of capital and enhance the power of working people, with the aim of winning further demands,\" wrote Joseph M. Schwartz, vice-chair of the DSA, and Bhaskar Sunkara, founding editor of socialist magazine Jacobin. They noted that single-payer health care is a classic example of just such a \"non-reformist reform.\"\n\nThat is, even as socialists push for Medicare for All -- a proposal that has gained momentum since Sanders made it a key plank of his 2016 presidential run -- they see expanded Medicare as just the first step towards a fully-nationalized health care system that would more closely resemble something like the Swedish model or the British National Health Service.\n\nSvart agreed that while progressive Democrats can serve as allies, the DSA is not in lockstep with coalitions like the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) - the House bloc that recently put forth a bill to abolish ICE. The bill was quickly deemed too radical to even merit a vote.\n\n\"We are united superficially, but we have a very different analysis,\" Svart said of the DSA's shared ground with progressive Democrats like the CPC.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, who made abolishing ICE a key rallying point in her campaign, has suggested that a more hard line leftist caucus would be in order. In an interview on \"The Dig,\" a Jacobin podcast, she proposed carving out \"a sub-caucus of the Progressive Caucus -- a smaller bloc, but one that operates as a bloc.\"\n\nThe idea was touted by leftist publications as a potential counterweight to the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus.\n\nMeanwhile, while she praised recent efforts to abolish ICE, Svart noted that the DSA believes in razing the agency specifically because it is \"a weapon of the ruling class to make working people afraid, and therefore more easy to exploit.\"\n\nShe doubts that most progressive lawmakers would agree with that framing.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

In December, Meadows made a surprise announcement that he will not run for reelection allowing for a primary runoff for the seat. The president and Meadows both supported Lynda Bennet.\n\nIf elected, Cawthorn, 24, would be the youngest member of congress.\n\nCawthorn, a resident of Hendersonville, North Carolina, was nominated to the Naval Academy by Meadows. However, in 2014, Cawthorn's plans were altered when he was in a near fatal car accident that left him paralyzed.\n\nThe accident is a prominent narrative in his run for office. In his first campaign video, Cawthorn's family members tell the story of his accident and his main cover image on his campaign website is a photograph of him sitting in his wheelchair dressed in hunting gear with a rifle on his shoulder.\n\nCawthorn declares himself a Trump supporter and constitutional conservative. He champions his youth and fights against liberal leftists.\n\n\"And I believe America is worth fighting for. Our faith, our freedoms, our American values are under assault leftists like Nancy Pelosi and AOC. I'm pro Trump, pro life, and post Second Amendment. I'm a fighter, like so many of you I've known great adversity and I'll be a strong voice for faith, family, freedom,\" Cawthorn says in his campaign video.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Cawthorn was asked on Morning Joe why Meadows endorsed his opponent during the primary, \"All I know is Mr. Meadows had been very good to me throughout my life. I wish I could have had his endorsement early on, but it appears that we did not need it.\"\n\nCawthorn also said President Trump called to congratulate him Tuesday evening, called the his victory \"beautiful\" and \"impressive\" and noted that the young candidate's campaign was able to overcome so many obstacles.\n\nIn November, Cawthorn will face Air Force veteran Morris \"Moe\" Davis. Davis was the chief prosecutor at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nCawthorn's campaign was boosted by a consulting firm created by a former aide to Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nFirst reported by The Hill, Bill Smith, who was Pence's chief of staff during his tenure as governor of Indiana and on Capitol Hill, posted on Facebook that his new consulting firm launched earlier this year, Sheridan Strategy Group, helped propel Cawthorn to his victory Tuesday.\n\nABC News' Benjamin Siegel contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Who?\" Trump asked.\n\nBiden asked the president to denounce the Proud Boys, referring to the far-right extremist group, which recently rallied in Portland, Oregon, and has been tied to acts of violence.\n\n\"Proud Boys. Stand back and stand by,\" Trump responded. \"But I'll tell you what, somebody has got to do something about antifa and the left because this is not a right-wing problem, this is a left-wing problem.\"\n\nABC News' Kyra Phillips asked Trump Wednesday at the White House if he would like to denounce white supremacy and Trump said he's \"always\" denounced it.\n\nWhen asked specifically about the Proud Boys, Trump said he \"doesn't know who they are\" and that they should \"stand down\" and \"let law enforcement do their work.\"\n\nStill, the Proud Boys were energized by the president's comments, unveiling a new message on T-shirts following the debate: \"President Trump, standing by.\"\n\nOn the conservative social media site Parler screenshots posted by a reporter found one user who said \"this makes me so happy.\" Another said, \"well sir! we're ready!\"\n\nAccording to The Washington Post , Trump's comments inspired memes including one of Trump in a polo shirt, which is part of the Proud Boys' signature aesthetic.\n\n\"The Proud Boys have already responded with the emblems that they're creating with the slogan and tweeting about it. And you know white supremacist groups, and far-right extremist groups in general, when something like this happens they really do see it as a legitimation as a -- an endorsement. And it really does embolden them,\" said Peter Simi, who studies extremism at Chapman University.\n\nThe Proud Boys is a men's group who call themselves \"Western chauvinist\" and say they are defending values like freedom and liberty. Formed in 2016 by Gavin McInnes, who later distanced himself from the group, they deny any connection to the alt-right and claim to be anti-political correctness and anti-white guilt, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center.\n\n\"But one of the things we're not is white supremacists and fascists,\" Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio said to The Washington Post.\n\n\"They, of course, claim they're not white supremacists, which is pretty typical for white supremacist groups to do more broadly,\" Simi told ABC News.\n\nStill, \"rank-and-file Proud Boys and leaders regularly spout white nationalist memes and maintain affiliations with known extremists. They are known for anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric,\" according to the SPLC.\n\nMembers of the group have been associated with acts of violence, including at the 2017 Unite the Rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where a 32-year-old woman was killed when a driver rammed into a crowd of counter-protesters. The driver was found guilty of first-degree murder.\n\nFormer Proud Boy member Jason Kessler helped organize the event, \"which brought together Klansmen, antisemites, Southern racists and militias. Kessler was only 'expelled' from the group after the violence and near-universal condemnation of the Charlottesville rally-goers,\" according to the SPLC.\n\nIn 2018, its members participated in street brawls during protests in Portland, Oregon, Seattle and New York City.\n\nFollowing the brawl in New York City, two of its members were sentenced to prison and seven others pleaded guilty, according to the Anti-Defamation League. Violence involving the Proud Boys was also present in Portland, Oregon, this summer, when right-wing and left-wing protesters clashed amid unrest over racism in policing in America, though no one from the group was arrested, according to the ADL.\n\n\"Violence in terms of becoming a member and really the violence that they promote towards people that they view as un-American whether it's communists, whether it's antifa, or 'leftists,'\" Simi, said.\n\nFor these far-right and extremist groups, Simi said, comments like the president's are seen as an endorsement.\n\n\"This is something that for these types of groups, it's music to their ears,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this summer, an intelligence bulletin obtained by ABC News cited the threat of white supremacists at protests.\n\n\"Based upon current information, we assess the greatest threat of lethal violence continues to emanate from lone offenders with racially or ethnically motivated violent extremist ideologies and (domestic violent extremists) with personalized ideologies,\" according to the bulletin, which was obtained by ABC News.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., condemned the president on Wednesday, saying his refusal to denounce the groups was \"beyond his capacity.\"\n\n\"In a national debate he not only refused to condemn a group of far-right white supremacists, he told them to stand by,\" Schumer said. \"As much of the country was in despair last night at the president's juvenile behavior, one group was celebrating, the Proud Boys. That's who was celebrating President Trump's debate performance: white supremacists.\"\n\nTrump's refusal to condemn white supremacist groups comes as Americans nationwide have been in the streets protesting over the deaths of Black Americans at the hands of police and as the president has sought to undermine the legitimacy of the election -- which is already underway -- and has called on supporters to go out to watch the polls on Election Day.\n\nSimi said the president's comments are unprecedented and his later refusal to condemn civil unrest following the election was just as dangerous.\n\n\"He essentially refused to do that. So he's already told the Proud Boys to stand by and now he's saying 'Hey civil disorder is not off the table. If this is a bogus election, that's a legitimate option and I've got my proud boys on standby,'\" he said.\n\nABC News' Allison Pecorin, Elizabeth Thomas, Will Steakin and Josh Margolin contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

I'm a Republican.\"\n\nHeng formed the group in March following her unsuccessful bid in 2018 for a seat in California's 16th Congressional District, losing to Democratic Rep. Jim Costa by 15 percentage points.\n\nShe began her political career by working for the Oregon Republican Party in 2010. She later worked under Congressman Ed Royce, R-Calif., as a press and legislative assistant before taking on the role of his deputy campaign manager in 2012. Heng also worked for the U.S. House's Foreign Affairs Committee from 2013 to 2017 before she launched her congressional bid.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, the freshman New York lawmaker, initially responded to the provocative ad Thursday night by tweeting: \"Republicans are running TV ads setting pictures of me on fire to convince people they aren't racist. Life is weird!\"\n\nShe later followed up with another tweet, condemning it further: \"Know that this wasn't an ad for young conservatives of color - that was the pretense. What you just watched was a love letter to the GOP's white supremacist case.\"\n\nHeng, the daughter Cambodian refugees, invoked rhetoric frequently used by President Donald Trump on the campaign trail, calling Democrats in Washington \"radical liberals\" in a statement Friday.\n\nAhead of Thursday's debate, the Trump campaign unleashed an ad blitz that included buying two full-page newspaper ads and flying a massive banner in the air that criticized socialism just before the debate began.\n\nPainting Democrats as socialists is routine for the president's reelection team, which has argued the entire opposition field is radical leftists.\n\nBut Heng went further in her statement, arguing that \"in reality socialism is forced obedience, conformity, and blind allegiance that leads to a tyrannical State. Socialism represents the exact opposite of the values and freedoms on which our nation was built.\"\n\nHeng's New Faces GOP PAC has raised about $170,000 so far this year, according to its most recent FEC filing. FEC reports show it's funded by a seemingly random group of GOP donors from across the country, including Trump donor Andrew Sabin.\n\nABC News' Will Steakin and Rachel Scott contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Little Rock Central students walk out in protest of Gov. Sarah Sanders education bill\n\nThe school is a civil rights landmark and Sanders' alma mater.\n\nStoried Little Rock Central High School, cited by Sarah Huckabee Sanders' campaign as formative in her rise to the Arkansas governor's mansion, was the site Friday of a student walkout to protest the cornerstone of her legislative agenda -- the LEARNS Act, a massive education reform bill Sanders vows will be a \"blueprint\" for the nation.\n\nDuring the school's third period, at 1 p.m., several hundred students left classes and flooded the lawn of the historic institution, where in 1957 nine Black students were escorted by federal troops to enforce the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Brown v. Board of Education, which ended the concept of \"separate but equal\" schools.\n\nThe walkout, organized by the school's Student Council, Young Leftists Club, Black Student Union and Gay-Straight Alliance, among other clubs, comes after a group of students penned an open letter to Sanders voicing strong concerns with the legislation and asking she not use the school's name to advance her agenda.\n\n\"Ambition. Personality. Opportunity. Preparation. Carved into the face of the monumental Little Rock Central High School, four statues overlook the campus grounds, each representing a different principle for which the school stands,\" the letter begins. \"Almost a century after these pillars were embedded into the walls of the building, Central High remains a beacon for these fundamental components of education. Today, because of Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and her omnibus education bill, the proposed LEARNS Act, these ideals are in danger.\"\n\nIn her Republican response last month to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address, Sanders mentioned Central as her alma mater while announcing she would release the details of her education plan the next day. The open letter -- with more than 1,300 signatures online since it was published Tuesday night -- calls her approach \"completely antithetical to the values that Central High stands for.\"\n\n\"I will never forget watching my dad, Gov. Mike Huckabee, and President Bill Clinton hold the doors open to the Little Rock nine -- doors that 40 years earlier had been closed to them because they were Black,\" Sanders said last month in the national spotlight. \"Today, those children once barred from the schoolhouse are now heroes, memorialized in bronze at our state house. I'm proud of the progress our country has made and helping every child access to a quality education regardless of their race or income, is the civil rights issue of our day.\"\n\nThe letter argues her bill will instead \"usher in a new era of segregation in Arkansas, where middle and upper-class white families take resources from public schools to escape to private ones, leaving marginalized kids with crumbling facilities, an antiquated curriculum, and teachers who are forced to prioritize their job security over the quality of their instruction.\"\n\nThe LEARNS Act, an omnibus bill intended to revamp education from early childhood classes through the 12th grade, calls for universal teacher raises, universal pre-K and a universal school voucher system phased in within three years. It also bans classroom instruction on \"gender identity, sexual orientation, and sexual reproduction\" before fifth grade -- prompting comparisons to Florida -- and bans teaching that would \"indoctrinate students with ideologies, such as Critical Race Theory.\"\n\nThe newly installed governor's first legislative foray has seen overwhelming support among Republican lawmakers in the state legislature, who hold a supermajority. It passed the Arkansas House 78-21 on Thursday, and Sanders said she expects to sign it into law \"early next week,\" as soon as the amended text passes the Senate.\n\nIt took 13 days from Sanders' State of the Union response for Republican lawmakers to release the full text of the 144-page bill and 10 days for it to clear both chambers of the statehouse. Three Republicans in the House and one in the Senate voted no.\n\n\"There are things that we know that are not working and areas where we must do better. This bill addresses that,\" said Jessica Saum of Cabot, last year's \"Teacher of the Year\" in Arkansas speaking this week at the state Capitol. \"Gov. Sanders has said that she will be known as Arkansas' education governor, and I believe that she is committed to that.\"\n\nStill, Central High students staged a walk out of Sanders' alma mater Friday afternoon, not even two miles from the governor's mansion.\n\nTwo student co-chairs with the school's Young Leftists chapter, who spoke to ABC News in a phone interview on Thursday night, said they would continue to organize against the legislation despite its swift movement and likely passage. They're planning a protest at the state Capitol next week to symbolically deliver the letter to Sanders.\n\n\"Me and all of my peers and a lot of my teachers, I know lots of people who were pretty disappointed and honestly appalled by the fact that she had kind of invoked the significance of Central,\" said Ernest Quirk, a senior from Little Rock who helped write the letter. \"The history of Central that she celebrates and touts as kind of part of her image, those are the kinds of things that would potentially be in danger with a lot this attack on what she calls indoctrination.\"\n\n\"The Little Rock Nine deserve to have their stories told and I think it would be a tragedy if those stories were to be lost,\" Quirk continued.\n\n\"We learn history to not recreate history,\" added Addison McCuien, a junior whose mother is a longtime teacher at the school. \"It would be devastating to watch that change unfold and for their legacy to be lost in history.\"\n\nQuirk and McCuien also reiterated concerns from the letter they co-wrote that Sanders' policies \"similar to those of Florida's anti-LGBTQ+ legislation will suppress the free expression of personality,\" raising comparisons to that state's so-called \"Don't Say Gay\" law.\n\nSanders' education secretary, Jacob Oliva, whom she tapped from the staff of Florida GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis, told lawmakers at a single Senate committee hearing on the bill last week that it was difficult to come up with a single definition of \"CRT\" but that the legislation aims to ensure students are taught \"how to think and not what to think.\"\n\nSanders' spokesperson, responding to questions from ABC News, did not say whether Sanders had seen the letter -- but the students said they would welcome her acknowledgment and a chance to air their grievances.\n\n\"If she ever did feel inclined to talk to us, I would welcome that with the most open arms possible,\" said Quirk. \"Because I think it's obvious this bill has not been very well thought through, and that's because of the fact that in the in the state of Arkansas, as a Republican lawmaker, you're not going to face opposition for any sort of deficiencies in any of the legislation you're passing.\"\n\n\"I would love for the governor to see our faces and hears our voices,\" added McCuien, who is Black and identifies as queer.\n\n\"This type of rhetoric is spreading all around the country, and this type of legislation is continuing to go from state to state,\" she added. \"But I want to do as much as I can to try and stop it in Arkansas.\"\n\nEditor's note: Reporter Libby Cathey is an alumna of Little Rock Central High School.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
