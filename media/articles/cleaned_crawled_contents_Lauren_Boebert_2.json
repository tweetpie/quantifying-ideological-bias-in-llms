      "text": "'One small problem': Lauren Boebert tried to 'ingratiate herself' with wrong person\n\nDuring President Donald Trump's inauguration festivities, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) reportedly tried to build goodwill with a top member of the administration. But she apparently identified the wrong person.\n\nThe American Spectator's \"Cockburn\" (a pseudonymous personality named after British Admiral Sir George Cockburn ) wrote Tuesday that they personally witnessed Boebert attempt for several hours to woo Trump's White House Chief of Staff. Cockburn dryly referred to the Colorado Republican as the \" socialite of the weekend ,\" saying she \"spent a decent chunk of Saturday's America First Policy Institute ball trying to ingratiate herself with Susie Wiles.\"\n\n\"One small problem: she wasn't talking to Wiles, just a woman from the Midwest who looks slightly like her,\" Cockburn wrote. \"Boebert was also spotted attempting to big-time her way into VIP with her sculpted himbo companion. On Sunday she found herself in a spirited discussion with staff in VIP at the Turning Point USA ball, as well as cutting a rug with Kid Rock.\"\n\nLA-based gossip publication TMZ was also there, and spotted Boebert in pro-Trump singer Kid Rock's vicinity at the event. The far-right congresswoman was described as \" totally fangirling \" over the singer along with her mother.\n\n\"Lauren was totally transfixed by the rock star, yapping away, doing a little dance, and clapping like she was front row at his concert -- basically giving Kid Rock all the hype he needed,\" the outlet\n\nBoebert was recently elected to her first term in her new congressional district in the eastern part of the Centennial State, which was previously represented by longtime Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) until he retired in 2024. Boebert relocating from Colorado's Western Slope, where she has since been r eplaced by Rep. Jeff Hurd (R-Colo.)\n\nAs TMZ also noted, Boebert previously made headlines in 2023 for being kicked out of a performance of the musical \"Beetlejuice\" after she refused to stop vaping in proximity to a pregnant woman and allegedly groping her date."

      "text": "Lauren Boebert's replacement in her old district vows to be different - but not by much\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado speaking in Phoenix in December 2021 (Gage Skidmore)\n\nU.S. Rep.-elect Jeff Hurd will soon take over representing Colorado's 3rd Congressional District after four years of representation by U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert.\n\nWhile the 45-year-old Grand Junction Republican said he has \"a different style\" than Boebert, he said they will have similar priorities when it comes to the district's needs. The district encompasses the Western Slope and the southwest corner of the state, sweeping east to include Pueblo, Otero and Las Animas counties. Hurd beat Democrat Adam Frisch in the November election with 50.8% of the district's vote over Frisch's 45.8%.\n\n\"When it comes to the issues, I think we're going to be working together,\" Hurd said of Boebert, a MAGA provocateur who is heading back to Congress from a new district. \"I think a lot of the issues that mattered to the 3rd Congressional District when she was representing it will continue to matter to the 3rd Congressional District, and I think we're going to fight to make sure that we advance sound economic policies that grow our economy, that create opportunities for families and for small businesses.\"\n\nHurd said when he gets to Congress he will work to secure the border, grow the energy economy in the 3rd District, and protect Colorado's water and agricultural resources. He's \"waiting to see\" what President-elect Donald Trump's immigration and deportation plans look like, he said, as he hasn't yet seen plans that are specific enough to judge.\n\n\"Certainly, I am in support of bringing to justice and deporting criminals, violent criminals. I think that needs to be a priority first and foremost,\" Hurd said. \"Beyond that, I think we need to wait and see what exactly the Trump administration is proposing.\"\n\nThe last Trump administration moved the national headquarters for the Bureau of Land Management and its senior officials from Washington, D.C., to Grand Junction, but the Biden administration reversed that move while keeping the agency's \"Western headquarters\" in the town. Some Trump allies have called for the headquarters to be relocated to the West again .\n\nHurd said he would support moving the agency's headquarters back to Grand Junction. While he isn't sure when or how that move might happen, Hurd said he's encouraged by the support for a return he's heard from other elected officials in the 3rd District and Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat.\n\n\"I think the decision makers should be here in the West where the lands are managed, and where they can be in closer contact with the people most affected by the decisions that this federal agency makes,\" Hurd said. \"I know this is an issue that is important for my district, it's important for our state, and it has support across the aisle politically as well, which is encouraging.\"\n\nHurd said he'll also have to wait and see the details of what Trump has proposed in terms of tariffs, though he does have \"some concerns about blanket tariffs and the impact that could have on our economy.\" He said the U.S. can use tariffs \"strategically and thoughtfully\" to make sure the country has its own resources and doesn't \"become too reliant on other countries, particularly when it comes to some critical minerals and resources.\"\n\n\"I think there's definitely a role that we can have in deploying tariffs strategically to not only right trade imbalances, but also advance America's national interest and national security priorities as well,\" Hurd said.\n\nTrump has said he will impose sweeping 25% tariffs on major American trade partners including Mexico, Canada and China as part of his efforts to bring down the cost of living. Economic experts say Trump's proposals will hurt American families' wallets with more expensive cars, appliances and technology.\n\nTrump also said he will have tech billionaire Elon Musk and former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, an effort to cut government spending and federal workforce. Hurd said the idea is encouraging and that he's curious to see what the pair leading the effort proposes. Making government more efficient and cutting spending are \"two very important priorities\" in the coming years, he said.\n\nColorado's new members of Congress spend the time between Election Day and Jan. 3, when they're sworn in, transitioning constituent services and setting up offices in their districts and D.C. Hurd will serve on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, and the House Committee on Natural Resources alongside Boebert and U.S. Rep.-elect Jeff Crank, a Colorado Springs Republican.\n\nHurd is one of three freshman Republicans heading to Congress from Colorado in January. Of the four congressional Republicans from Colorado in the new term, Boebert is the only incumbent, though she will now represent the 4th District. Crank will represent Colorado's 5th Congressional District, and U.S. Rep.-elect Gabe Evans will represent Colorado's 8th Congressional District.\n\n\"I'm excited to work with all of them, and I think there's a lot of opportunity for us to do good things for not only our districts, but for our state,\" Hurd said. \"I'm also encouraged by the opportunities to collaborate with our colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle as well.\"\n\nHurd said he has already met with U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, a Lafayette Democrat who serves as the assistant minority leader in the House, Democratic U.S. Rep. Jason Crow of Centennial, and Democratic U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, and he looks forward to working across the aisle with Colorado's Democrats on issues important to the whole state.\n\n\"I think there's an opportunity to work together as a Colorado delegation on issues that aren't  partisan, but that matter to all of us as Coloradans - first and foremost would be water and protecting that precious resource,\" Hurd said.\n\nHurd said his constituents are concerned about issues that affect their lives daily, including the cost of food, housing and energy. He said they also want leaders to secure the border, protect social security and Medicare, and ensure veterans get quality care.\n\nAfter Hurd's election night watch party, the Grand Junction Sentinel reported members of the media were \"sequestered\" in a curtained area separate from other attendees and had to be escorted anytime they left the area. Hurd said he hopes \"to be open and accessible and responsive\" to the media, particularly local media outlets in the 3rd District, which he said are a great way to reach his constituents. He said he also plans to be accessible to his constituents, hosting town halls and answering their questions.\n\n\"Effective communication is at the heart of making sure that the citizens of the 3rd Congressional District know what their representative is doing on their behalf in Washington and how I will be working for them,\" Hurd said. \"I look forward to engaging with those I represent, whether or not they voted for me, and hearing what their concerns are, what their questions are, what their priorities are and how I can best help.\"\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\n\nColorado Newsline is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

      "text": "Loony Lauren Boebert needs some relationship advice\n\nDear Lauren Boebert,\n\nCop a squat and let's chat. First off, I get it. I was raised rural, and I know how it's almost impossible to resist a man who spells his name exotically like your ex, Jayson. (I'm thinking \"Brandin,\" \"Trystan\" and most definitely \"Jordyn.\")\n\nWeirdly spelled boy names are a redneck girl's catnip is all I'm saying. But girl. You can't be having a private Sadday night dinner in a sit-down restaurant with your EX-HUSBAND because you know as well as I do he's easy to rile. He's got that professional wrestler neck and you can tell he's fixin' to go off when the veins start poppin'. So, yeah, of course he's gonna show his tail and get arrested and have to pay a big ol' fine that could've been better spent buying more guns for the grandbaby, right?\n\nLauren-may I call you Nutball?-things don't work out when you date in public. I get it. You're newly single and you've forgotten how people act on a date. That's why I'll give you a pass for that unfortunate Beetlejuice groping-and-vaping incident a few months back. But that doesn't mean you go out with your extremely intoxicated creepy ex again! There are lots of fish in the sea! At least for now but climate change could end all that. What's that? It's snowing in Colorado so \"global warming\" is a hoax the Dems use to scare decent folk? Bless your heart.\n\nNutball, I know a high-profile evangelical like you can't just hop on Hinge to find a man. Your old ride-or-die, Marjorie Taylor Greene, also recently divorced, is having a tough time of it, too. She can't hardly go anywhere without pulling out nekkid pictures of Hunter Biden to show everybody which is a cry for help if you ask me.\n\nIt's not just the whole dating nightmare stuff, Nutball. Now you're complaining to anybody who will listen about how you're being chased out of your own House district by Ryan Reynolds.\n\nOh, you WISH you were being chased anywhere by Ryan Reynolds. Maybe because of your current man trouble, you're hypersensitive to a movie star donating money to your Congressional opponent. But you can't crow about freedom and then whine about who gives money to whom on Steve Bannon's pretend TV show. (Think Easy-Bake Oven but with Nazi undertones.) Besides, you take plenty of money from the gun lobby. That's your right. That said, if I had to choose between taking money from the \"Thoughts and Prayers\" cabal or the star of \"Deadpool,\" pretty sure you know who I'd go with.\n\nAlso, what's this business of running for re-election in a new district? You should remember the old saying: \"Dance with the one that brung ya.\" If you were really \"mama grizzly\" tough, you wouldn't be chased out of your home district by Barbra Streisand's paltry $1,500 donation to your opponent. You can't stop talking about it and all I can think is, $1,500? She lives at Malibu! Also, she's Barbra Streisand! Talk about cheap. That amount wouldn't pay for the pointer finger of Babs' legendary nail regimen!\n\nI know your mind's made up about running in a district less inclined to accept movie star money but, where's your backbone? Kidding. It's probably just tossed into the Congressional coat closet with all the others. It'd be easier to find Elon's soul.\n\nYour new district isn't very excited about your big move because they don't want all the drama.\n\n\"We just want to focus on the everyday issues that affect Coloradans,\" one voter told a reporter. Adorbs, right?\n\nMeanwhile, your ex is runnin' around using bad grammar per usual and irritating the snot outta you.\n\nNutball, I can't believe I'm saying this, but you can do better. Not Ryan Reynolds better but, yeah, better.\n\nNC Newsline is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

Lauren Boebert (R-Colorado) has often promoted herself as a moralist, attacking Democrats as anti-religion and declaring that she is \"tired of this separation of church and state junk.\"\n\nBut Democrats have responded that the far-right MAGA congresswoman doesn't practice what she preaches, as she was thrown out of a theater in Denver in September 2023 for vaping and creating a disturbance. Now, CNN is reporting that Boebert was so drunk at a fundraiser in December that servers refused to give her any more alcoholic beverages.\n\nAccording to CNN's Melanie Zanona , \"Three months after Rep. Lauren Boebert apologized for disruptive conduct at a Denver theater, the Colorado Republican attended a glitzy Republican gala headlined by former President Donald Trump in Manhattan, where her behavior once again raised eyebrows. At the December soiree, which was the New York Young Republican Club's annual gala, multiple witnesses saw a server tell Boebert they would not bring her any more alcohol, with one witness telling CNN the server told the congresswoman they believed she had been overserved.\"\n\nZanona adds , \"Throughout the night, Boebert also kept attempting to snap selfies with Trump, who was sitting at the same table as her. Eventually, Trump's security detail stepped in and asked Boebert to stop, according to the witnesses, who attended the event and saw the interaction take place.\"\n\nBoebert is seeking a third term in the U.S. House of Representatives, although not in the district where she is presently serving.\n\nAlthough Boebert's seat is in Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, she is running for reelection in the 4th and is competing for the seat that, until recently, was held by former Rep. Ken Buck . Boebert decided that she had a better chance of winning another term via the 4th, but she is facing a tough GOP primary and is being slammed as a \"carpetbagger\" from some Colorado Republicans for switching districts.\n\nRead CNN's full report at this link ."

      "text": "How Lauren Boebert could soon be the 'flashiest Trump minion to fall'\n\nIn Colorado's small towns of Otis and Limon, New York Times' Opinion national politics writer Michelle Cottle recently observed US Rep. Lauren Boebert's (R-CO) latest campaign events earlier this week, ahead of the state's Tuesday primary election.\n\nCottle points out in a Sunday, June 23 op-ed that the election will dictate the MAGA congresswoman's \"political fate.\"\n\nFollowing a tumultuous, public divorce, and news that Boebert was kicked out of a Denver theater performance of \"Beetlejuice\" for vaping last fall, the Colorado GOP leader made the decision to ditch the state's Third District, and aim to take US Rep. Ken Buck's (R-CO) seat in the Fourth District.\n\nPaying close attention to Boebert's interaction with her campaign event attendees, Cottle writes: \"She appeared a far cry from the outrage artist who so aggressively heckled Mr. Biden during his first State of the Union address that she embarrassed her own party's leadership. But this election has forced Ms. Boebert out of her comfort zone, as she works to woo a set of voters on the opposite side of the state from the area she has represented the last few years.\"\n\nAs Boebert answered voter questions at Oscar's Bar & Grille in Limon, Cottle notes that the far-right congresswoman \"repeatedly tripped over her tongue, at one point joking that it would be great if anyone had some coffee, 'praise the Lord.'\"\n\nThe Times writer emphasizes, \"That phrase is like a verbal tic for her, used frequently, less as an exclamation than as a filler or a bridge, especially at awkward moments. And one of the surprises during my time with Ms. Boebert was how many awkward or uncertain moments she seemed to have - at voter events, in debates or simply standing unnoticed in a crowd.\"\n\nCottle notes :\n\nAfter the Q. and A., as Ms. Boebert posed for pics, I asked a tableful of people for their impressions. 'I'm still trying to get my mind around the idea of her winning,' a middle-aged man named Chris told me.\n\nChris and his friends didn't have a problem with her politics. And they pooh-poohed her personal drama, expressing a who-among-us-could-live-under-a-microscope view. But they were plenty miffed that she had moved across Colorado to run in their district when the going got tough in hers. If she abandoned those constituents, how do we know she won't dump us at the first opportunity? reasoned Chris, who pronounced her that slipperiest of all creatures, 'a politician.'\n\nThe Times columnist emphasizes if Boebert \"loses on Tuesday, she will be the flashiest Trump minion to fall. If she wins, it will in part be thanks to her ability to modulate for different audiences, much like a regular ol' politician. Either way, her electoral fate will tell us something about the limits of over-the-top Trumpism by candidates not named Donald Trump, and how much wiggle room such candidates have within its strictures.\"\n\nCottle's full op-ed is available at this link (subscription required)."

Boebert did not attend the court proceeding.

      "text": "The Republican Congresswoman Taking on Lauren Boebert\n\nWhy is a South Carolina Republican policing her party's far-right flank? Here are three possibilities.\n\nIn a world where elected Republicans were not terrified of the most extreme elements of their base, the response to Representative Lauren Boebert's open Islamophobia would have been swift public condemnation. We do not live in that world.\n\nKevin McCarthy, the leader of the House Republicans, has not denounced Boebert's comments comparing Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota to a suicide bomber. He knows that scolding her could anger the base, divide his caucus, and threaten his dream of someday being crowned speaker of the House. Other congressional Republicans recognize this reality too, which is why so few of them denounced Boebert's \"jihad squad\" comments or Representative Paul Gosar's creepy video in which he murders an anime version of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. So far, only a handful of Republican lawmakers have explicitly condemned these incidents, including two well-known Trump critics: Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who's retiring in the face of a primary challenge, and Liz Cheney of Wyoming, whose home-state Republican Party no longer recognizes her as a member.\n\nAnother was freshman Republican Nancy Mace. On CNN this week, the South Carolina lawmaker called Boebert's rhetoric \" disgusting .\" Two weeks ago, she told MSNBC that Gosar's video was \"reprehensible\" (though she did not vote to censure him). Mace is not exactly a member of the anti-Trump caucus; her position in the GOP ecosystem is harder to nail down. After the January 6 Capitol riot, Mace said that Donald Trump had no future in the Republican Party. She quickly backed away from that position , though, and has spent the rest of the year engaging in petty fights with Ocasio-Cortez, shouting about antifa, and going on Fox News to riff on GOP talking points. This summer, Mace voted to oust Liz Cheney from her leadership position after Cheney was critical of Trump. In the past few months, Mace has seemed to accept the reality that not only is there a role for Trump in her party, but also that he is still its unrivaled leader.\n\nMace, in other words, appeared to have fallen back in line. So why, then, has she chosen to help police her party's most Trumpian figures? I asked her office and didn't hear back. But knowing the answer to this question could help illuminate why so few Republicans have taken the kinds of risks that she has. I profiled Mace in July , and I've followed her career closely. She could have any number of motivations, but my reporting points to one in particular.\n\nRead: How a rising Trump critic lost her nerve\n\nIt's possible that Mace is genuinely disgusted by Boebert's anti-Muslim comments. Perhaps her gut reaction was to address them head-on. Sometimes politicians do the right thing simply because it is the right thing to do. That same impulse could be what drove Mace to criticize Trump after January 6, before she seemed to change her mind.\n\nMore cynically, Mace might see some sort of political benefit here. Her district, which runs from Charleston to Hilton Head, isn't quite as conservative as the rest of South Carolina. Her voters are a bit more socially moderate and environmentally conscious, and Mace ran on a platform that didn't line up neatly with that of her Republican peers. She might have figured that the voters in her district would be turned off by Boebert's Islamophobia, and that they would give her credit for calling it out. Inserting herself in Twitter spats is probably good for fundraising too: Mace's condemnation of Boebert has already been retweeted by at least one Democratic legislator, who held up her tweet as an example of a GOP lawmaker \"caught being good\" and recommended that people read Mace's book. In the coming weeks, Mace might see an ensuing increase in donations. She's already expecting at least one primary challenge next year, so she needs all the financial help she can get.\n\nFeel free to believe either of those theories. But something else could also be at work here. Mace is charismatic, smart, and ambitious, and it must be disheartening for her to be constantly overshadowed by colleagues who traffic in racism and conspiracy theories about Jewish space lasers . It must be exhausting, having to fight for attention while people like Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene become the new faces of the American right. Getting involved in this beef-or any beef-is perhaps the best way for Nancy Mace to get her name out there. Conflict makes for good stories; it attracts the attention of TV producers and Atlantic editors. Throwing punches is a good way for a neglected politician to get ahead. Mace would be far from the first politician to have recognized this.\n\nMace's political evolution has been difficult to track. She cannot be perfectly categorized as a \"moderate\" Republican, nor as a\"pro-Trump\" member. But one thing seems clear: She recognizes that \"that the Republican base wants AOC-type celebrities in office,\" one South Carolina GOP consultant told me earlier this year. A Republican commentator from her home state told me that he wished Mace would keep her head down. \"You have the option of not being available for comment or [not] taking their call,\" he said. \"She seems to be addicted to the cable-news scene.\" A local Democratic strategist told me that he'd rarely seen a lawmaker positioning themselves so openly for a shot at stardom. \"She wants to grow her list and go on TV every day and raise money and sell books.\" She isn't thinking about staying in the House, he said. \"She's thinking about what's next.\" Mace's decision to participate in my July profile of her is more evidence for this theory. Most politicians don't agree to spend time with reporters, let alone go to the gun range with them , unless they see some sort of advantage to doing so. A politician who grants that sort of access to a reporter may not like the resulting story, but when you're a freshman member of Congress who wants to be well-known, all publicity is good publicity .\n\nRead: The Texas Republican asking his party to just stop\n\nMaybe in the end, Mace's motive for calling out Boebert and Gosar's bad behavior doesn't matter; maybe everyone should appreciate the simple fact that she is doing it. But if you're looking for hopeful signs that the Republican caucus has grown more willing to crack down on its most extreme members, Mace's critiques of her peers are not compelling evidence."

      "text": "House Republicans Showed Up at a Campus Protest. Of Course.\n\nJust what the college unrest needed: political theater\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nRepresentative Lauren Boebert had an important point to make. But it could be difficult to hear the rabble-rousing Republican from Colorado over a packed-in crowd of counter-agitators.\n\n\"So this is what the students here at GW University are facing each and every day,\" Boebert was trying to say into a bank of microphones in the middle of the downtown Washington, D.C., campus of George Washington University on Wednesday afternoon. She and five of her GOP colleagues from the House Oversight Committee had just toured an encampment of tents, or a \"liberation camp,\" that protesters had put up last week in opposition to Israel's war in Gaza.\n\n\"Their learning activities are being disrupted,\" Boebert said of the students. \"Their finals are being disrupted.\"\n\nBut protesters kept disrupting Boebert. Or were she and her friends from Congress the disrupters in this particular Washington-bubble showdown? Who were the rabble in this equation, and who were the rousers?\n\n\"What about you in that theater?\" one woman called out at Boebert from the back of the crowd, referring to a September incident in which the congresswoman was kicked out of a musical comedy after canoodling with a date, vaping, and talking in the midst of the production.\n\nThis was not the same protester as the one who had been trailing behind Boebert holding up a cardboard sign that said, simply, Beetlejuice , referring to the play that she'd been evicted from. (Google it, and you'll find security footage of the episode-or don't.)\n\nDavid A. Graham: Biden's patience with campus protests runs out\n\nIf only theaters could always incubate such frivolity. But these are bloody days in the embattled theater of the Middle East, which have in turn triggered a spate of protests on American campuses, marked by episodes of bigotry, sporadic violence, and arrests. Combine this with a group of elected performance artists who couldn't help but try to grab a cheap morsel of attention from this bitterly serious conflict, and you have the political theater that played out on Wednesday.\n\n\"Dude, are you gonna talk, or am I gonna talk?\" Representative Byron Donalds, Republican of Florida, admonished a protester who interrupted his turn at the mic, after Boebert had spoken. Donalds wore dark glasses and a tight-fitting navy suit.\n\nLike his colleagues, Donalds called for the immediate removal of the protesters from campus-something that, to this point, the D.C. police department has declined to do . \"The mayor is weak in the face of foolishness,\" Donalds said, referring to Washington's chief executive, Muriel Bowser.\n\n\"You wouldn't allow someone to stay in your house or stay in your dorm room. You would have them removed,\" Donalds said. \"Everybody believes in peaceful protest, but this is trespassing.\"\n\n\"What about January 6?\" a man standing next to me called out. Yes, what about that, sir?\n\n\"Calm down. I'm talking now,\" Donalds said, addressing another heckler.\n\nTyler Austin Harper: America's colleges are reaping what they sowed\n\nAbout 20 minutes earlier, Representative James Comer, the chair of the House Oversight Committee, had also urged calm as he paraded through the tent city. People shouted after Comer, mocking his committee's fizzling effort to impeach President Joe Biden, while another said something about Hunter Biden. The voices and signs all blurred together into a muggy cacophony.\n\n\"Lauren Boebert, seen any good movies lately?\"\n\nLesbians for Palestine .\n\nI Stand With Israel .\n\nComer led his delegation past a row of tables covered with donated food for the protesters-pizza, granola bars, peanuts, bags of tangerines. Everything is FREE, like Palestine will be free , advertised a poster on the food spread, which covered several yards at the edge of the quad.\n\n\"Mr. Chairman, do you think your appearance today is going to lead to police violence on campus?\" a man with a British accent asked Comer.\n\n\"Probably,\" the congressman said, projecting zero concern.\n\n\"You want some pizza?\" another onlooker asked Comer, who kept walking.\n\nThe congressman seemed eager to get on with the quick and chaotic press conference that would punctuate the lawmakers' visit. \"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you,\" an outnumbered supporter yelled out. The congressman waited for his colleagues to make their brief statements and seized the closing message for himself.\n\n\"Help is on the way for George Washington University,\" promised Comer, who then joined his colleagues as they struggled through a thick crowd-and a \" Beetlejuice \" chant-before departing this enclave of academia and heading back to their own pillared sanctum on Capitol Hill."

      "text": "What a Gun Is For\n\nLauren Boebert is using her family Christmas portrait to provoke liberal hysteria. But the photo reveals something much more significant about how America has changed.\n\nAs families around the country prepare to send out Christmas cards with letters and photos commemorating the year gone by, many elected officials do the same. Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky tweeted one such family picture on Saturday, featuring himself and his clan armed to the teeth on a leather love seat, a merry tree glittering in the backdrop. Massie's photo drew some ire . Not to be outdone, Representative Lauren Boebert of Colorado, dropped her own Christmas-themed gun portrait today. \"The Boeberts have your six, @RepThomasMassie!\" Boebert tweeted . \"No spare ammo for you, though.\"\n\nThe Boeberts have your six, @RepThomasMassie ! (No spare ammo for you, though) pic.twitter.com/EnDYuXaHDF\n\nMowing down your enemies with extreme prejudice probably doesn't feel like a fair approximation of the Christmas spirit, but neither are these photos much related to the season. They are what they are, and they've done what they were meant to do: bother liberals. I don't take Massie or Boebert to be anything other than a troll-at this point, I take very little political rhetoric to be much other than trolling-but their trolling is poignant, not as an intended provocation, but as a marker of the passage of time.\n\nRead: Growing up with guns\n\nBoebert's and Massie's photos suggest that we have moved past the point of a kind of firearm respectability politics. Here, the very meaning of guns is to make liberals hysterical; liberal hysteria is no longer an obstacle to good policy making or even an irritating by-product of the democratic process, but rather the desired outcome of almost all right-wing political rhetoric. It doesn't matter if the guns make sense for sport shooting, collecting, hunting, or any other plausible pastime beyond killing people or putting pictures on the internet. Their owners don't intend any confusion on that point. Being photographed for the internet is their raison d'être. If they were just typical-looking guns with potentially reasonable uses kept in a safe, how would they make liberals cry?\n\nI'm not triggered, as it were, by the mere sight of guns. And I tend toward the belief that there are so many guns in circulation and so risibly few politicians demonstrably invested in taking any kind of action on even meek and meager changes to gun policy that there's not much point in talking about it anymore. Our own politicians are celebrating guns at Christmas mere days after a school shooting precipitated by the purchase of a handgun for the perpetrator as-yes-a Christmas gift. America armed its civilians with so many guns that it conquered itself. I guess this is defeat.\n\nI just remember that it wasn't always this way. Even in my own short lifetime it was different. I was born and raised in Texas, as was every generation of my family as far back as we know, except the branch from Louisiana, who were just as well armed as the rest. My great-grandparents-farmers, all-had guns; my grandparents had guns; my parents have guns. None of these people were what I would describe as liberal, though I've heard, over the years, of pockets of warm feeling toward Franklin D. Roosevelt for how he handled the Dust Bowl and the aftermath of the Great Depression. And none of them seemed much enamored with their guns.\n\nThe guns were tools. My maternal grandfather, an Air Force mechanic from Childress, Texas, who enlisted at age 17, had a bolt-action kit gun that he used for hunting rabbits and squirrels, which he fed, once dressed, to his younger siblings; he later bought a German Luger picked off a dead Nazi from a friend in the service, and treasured it for many years. Toward the end, he purchased a nickel-plated .32 for my grandmother after a burglary; it was never fired. My father inherited his grandfather's 16-gauge shotgun, part of a hunting set the man had dispersed among his grandsons once they came of age. In his younger days, he took deer throughout the hill country of Texas and Colorado. All my life, that gun-a beautiful piece of work, with floral engraving along the stock-lay under my parents' bed, in plain sight. My first recollection about it is that I should not ever touch it.\n\nRead: My family's gun wounds-a tale in three acts\n\nDad told us the only reason to hold a gun was to use it, and the only reason to point it at someone was to kill them. He told us that you only thought you knew whether it was loaded; he told us stories of people who were sure their guns were unloaded-and then. He told us that rifles were for hunting (in our own Texas domicile, he shot a mating pair of raccoons that had moved into the attic, a handful of opossums, and even, preposterously, a rat) and that handguns and assault weapons were for killing people. I knew that he kept the shotgun around for home defense as well as vermin, but there was never a need for it. And I don't think that disappointed him.\n\nThese people never took photos with their guns. They came from an older world, before guns became props in a culture war with real casualties, when they were still needful tools in a wild country. I remember the way they treated their guns, and their universe seems so distant from the one we live in now. My dad used to say: \"This isn't for play; this isn't a toy.\" But what else do you call something that you put into the hands of a little child at Christmas?"

      "text": "The Curtain Falls on George Santos\n\nI spoke with my colleague Russell Berman about the expulsion of the New York representative, and what it indicates about the future of the Republican Party.\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nThis morning, Republican Representative George Santos became the sixth House member in American history to be expelled from Congress. Though Santos managed to hang on to the support of the majority in his party, he was ousted in a 311-114 vote. I spoke with my colleague Russell Berman , who covers politics, about why some members voted not to expel Santos, and how much of an outlier he really is.\n\nFirst, here are three new stories from The Atlantic :\n\nLora Kelley: How did we get to a place where Santos is being expelled, and how did he make it to Congress in the first place?\n\nRussell Berman: George Santos ran in what should have been a high-profile, competitive race last year in Long Island. He was in a swing district that was fiercely contested because control of the House was on the line. And yet, he basically snuck into Congress without the scrutiny that comes with being a candidate in a competitive race. It was only a few weeks after his election that The New York Times reported that he'd basically lied about his entire résumé: He'd lied about getting degrees from Baruch College and New York University. He'd lied about working on Wall Street for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. He'd even allegedly lied about having grandparents who'd fled Nazi Germany during the Holocaust, and he claimed that his mother was in the Twin Towers on 9/11.\n\nWhen Santos arrived in Congress, in January, Republicans had a very thin majority. Kevin McCarthy needed Santos's vote to become speaker, so he was unwilling to sanction him. Instead, he sent the issue to the House Ethics Committee, which spent months investigating Santos.\n\nIt turned out, his lies about his résumé were only the tip of the iceberg. According to the indictment that was filed in federal court, he used made-up loans and contributors' credit-card information to inflate his campaign. The Ethics Committee also alleged that he'd exploited his congressional funding to benefit himself financially, spending money on things like OnlyFans and Botox. (Santos has generally denied the allegations and called the report a \"smear,\" but he has refused to address them specifically.) For many Republicans, the report was the last straw.\n\nLora: Santos has faced two previous expulsion attempts. Why did those votes fail while today's passed?\n\nRussell: Before Santos, the House had expelled only five members in its history. Those representatives were either members of the Confederacy during the Civil War or had been convicted of crimes in court. Santos has been accused of crimes, but he has so far not been convicted.\n\nPoliticians are sensitive to having their career upended based solely on accusations of wrongdoing. Before this ethics report came out, dozens of Democrats opposed Santos's expulsion. They did not want to set this precedent that damning accusations were enough to expel somebody. A couple of Democrats ended up voting against expelling him today, and two voted present.\n\nMany Republicans, similarly, said they were worried about precedent. That was the official reason for backing him, but it was, of course, wrapped up in congressional politics, as so many of these things are. The new speaker, Mike Johnson, along with basically the entire Republican leadership and the majority of Republican representatives, voted against expelling Santos. They still have a very narrow majority. Now there's going to be a special election for Santos's seat, and it's certainly possible that a Democrat could replace him.\n\nLora: Did the fact that his alleged crimes were so brazen affect the calculus about voting him out?\n\nRussell: Certainly, Republicans wanted to get rid of the headache and the drama. But Republicans have made plenty of drama on their own. So it's hard to say that, by getting rid of this allegedly corrupt member, all of a sudden they're going to have a smoothly functioning, business-oriented House of Representatives.\n\nSantos had already announced that he's not running for reelection, which, for some members, might have been a reason not to expel him. But for other members, the thinking was likely: If he's not running, we might as well lance the boil now . There's been such a circus atmosphere around him.\n\nLora: To what extent do you see him as representative of the Republican Party at this moment, versus a true outlier?\n\nRussell: We've seen all of these performative, not very substantive members of Congress lately: Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert. Some of them seem to prioritize gaining followers on social media and getting on Fox News over passing bills. They don't actually want to be legislators; they want to be political celebrities. In that sense, Santos was not unique.\n\nBut in the sheer breadth of his deception and lies, he was. We've seen corrupt members of Congress: people who have used campaign accounts for personal benefit, who have taken bribes. That's as old as politics. But what we haven't seen until now is someone who created their life story out of whole cloth.\n\nLora: What, if anything, will this change for Republicans?\n\nRussell: I don't think this changes much. The Republican Party was not even close to unanimous on this vote. Remember, at the same time that they're holding Santos accountable, they are largely rallying around Donald Trump, who has been indicted in four different criminal cases, who is known to lie, and who has had all kinds of ethical lapses over the course of the past several years. I don't think this is going to set any new precedent on the part of the Republican Party.\n\nRelated:\n\nToday's News\n\nDispatches\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\nWhat Kissinger Didn't Understand\n\nBy George Packer\n\nHenry Kissinger spent half a century pursuing and using power, and a second half century trying to shape history's judgment of the first.

      "text": "They Should Have Taken Them at Their Word\n\nSupporters are recoiling from some Republican politicians, not because they betrayed their campaign-trail promises, but because they fulfilled them.\n\nThey never saw it coming.\n\nBen Goldey resigned as Representative Lauren Boebert's communications director after the January 6 attempted coup. Lauren Blair Bianchi quit the same job in Senator Ted Cruz's office. George Erwin Jr. had rallied local law-enforcement backers for Representative Madison Cawthorn and was preparing to take a job working for him, but has now disavowed him . Charles Johnson, the owner of the San Francisco Giants, maxed out to Boebert's campaign but now wants his money back .\n\nThere's a story as old as politics: A leader comes to power promising one thing, then does another, leaving behind a disappointed crew of supporters. From Brutus's misgivings about Julius Caesar's nascent dictatorship to Adolphe Thiers's misjudgment of Louis Napoleon to David Stockman's realization that Ronald Reagan wasn't completely sincere about shrinking government, the same thing has happened time and again. Mentors, supporters, financial backers, and eager young aides have become disillusioned and complained that their hero has changed.\n\nThat's not what has happened here, though. In the cases of Boebert, Cawthorn, Cruz, and Senator Josh Hawley, their old allies are distancing themselves not because these politicians failed to do what they promised-the problem is they have been only too successful at accomplishing what they promised.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Don't let them pretend this didn't happen\n\nThese defections are part of a broader trend of Republicans and donors recoiling from politicians connected to the failed January 6 coup attempt, which was encouraged by President Donald Trump and many lawmakers. The backlash does not measure up to the scale of the offense, and it may not last, but it has forced some reconsiderations in Washington.\n\nThose distancing themselves from these four lawmakers deserve particularly little credit for late epiphanies, though. As candidates and members of Congress, they were explicit and direct about what they intended. Their backers apparently didn't believe they were serious, didn't believe they could follow through, or cynically concluded that their more dangerous tendencies were electorally advantageous.\n\n\"Today is 1776,\" Boebert tweeted the morning of January 6, then she objected to certifying Joe Biden's victory later that day, falsely alleging \"fraudulent\" votes.\n\nNo one who had heard of Boebert before then should have had any illusions about her views. Everything about Boebert's support for a violent attempt to overturn the election was telegraphed during her campaign. She defeated a Republican incumbent in a primary by complaining that he was complicit in allowing blue states to \"steal\" Colorado's votes. Her political persona was built on her fondness for the open carry of firearms and her willingness to thumb her nose at the rule of law, ignoring the state's coronavirus protocols. (This in addition to two minor charges in her past, one of which was dismissed and another that resulted in a $100 fine. ) She also flirted with QAnon, saying she was \"very familiar\" with it. \"Everything that I've heard of Q, I hope that this is real, because it only means that America is getting stronger and better, and people are returning to conservative values,\" she said in an interview.\n\nAfter his donation to Boebert came under scrutiny, Johnson, the Giants' owner, issued a statement asking for his money back and condemning the insurrection. \"It is often difficult to predict the future behavior of candidates and I would never have imagined that any legitimate candidate would participate in undermining the core values of our great country,\" he said. This is absurd. Boebert's actions, and their effects on January 6, were not an aberration. They were instead an unexpectedly early victory for her unhinged rhetoric.\n\nCawthorn is another member of the freshman class in Congress. Like Boebert, he won an upset primary victory, and like Boebert, he made his views clear during the campaign. In 2017, he posted an Instagram picture from Hitler's vacation retreat, which he said was on his bucket list. One might write this off as mere history-buff stuff if not for other troubling material: his odd comments about converting Jews, his charge that Senator Cory Booker \"aims to ruin white males running for office,\" the multiple women who claimed he made unwanted sexual advances , his own misleading claim about admission to the Naval Academy.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The insurrectionists would like you to know they're the real victims\n\nAfter the election, Cawthorn quickly adopted Trump's claims of fraud. In December, he spoke at a Turning Points USA event in Florida. \"So, everybody, I'm telling you, I'm encouraging you, please get on the phone, call your congressman,\" he said. \"And feel free-you can lightly threaten them and say, 'You know what? If you don't start supporting election integrity, I'm coming after you. Madison Cawthorn is coming after you. Everybody's coming after you.'\" He also spoke at the \"Stop the Steal\" rally on January 6 before the riot, saying, \"This crowd has some fight in it.\" (He was right.)\n\nIn the aftermath of the riot, some of Cawthorn's supporters suddenly got cold feet. Two Western North Carolina conservative activists who'd backed his run for office unloaded on Cawthorn on Facebook. \"He has blood on his hands,\" wrote Eddie Harwood. Erwin, a former sheriff who campaigned and vouched for Cawthorn and had been asked to be his district director, agreed. \"I apologize to all of my law enforcement friends, other politicians, family and friends-I was wrong, I misled you,\" he replied.\n\n\"I started to think, Okay, where there is some smoke, there has got to be some fire here ,\" Erwin told Blue Ridge Public Radio . He's right, but the smoke was there all along.\n\nStill, no condemnation has been as fierce as what former Senator Jack Danforth of Missouri had to say about Hawley, his erstwhile protégé.\n\n\" Supporting Josh and trying so hard to get him elected to the Senate was the worst mistake I ever made in my life,\" Danforth told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch . \"Yesterday was the physical culmination of the long attempt (by Hawley and others) to foment a lack of public confidence in our democratic system. It is very dangerous to America to continue pushing this idea that government doesn't work and that voting was fraudulent.\"\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump lost everything for Republicans\n\nPerhaps Danforth was fooled by Hawley's résumé: Stanford undergrad, Yale Law School, clerking for Chief Justice John Roberts, professorships, and a book from Yale Press. But Hawley made clear during his 2018 Senate race that he would back Trump to the hilt, come what may -as well as that any ideological commitments were plastic and subordinate to his ambition. Cruz, who quickly switched from Trump critic to obsequious appeaser after the 2016 election, had shown his true colors long before January 6, too.\n\nThe professions of surprise and horror from allies of Boebert, Cawthorn, Cruz, and Hawley recall the early weeks of the Trump presidency. Despite everything that Trump said during the 2016 election, some Republicans continued to believe that he would moderate once in office. What he said on the trail was just what he said on the trail: campaign promises and nothing more. The gravity of his duty would be impressed upon him once he entered office, and even if it didn't, he'd be easily controlled by his aides and by experienced politicians like Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell.\n\nThat is, of course, not what happened. Trump wasn't just vamping for crowds (not that it would have excused his demagoguery if he were), and neither were these politicians. Their sin is that they did precisely what they said they would. Their staffers, donors, and mentors' sin was refusing to believe them."

And now, nearly two weeks after they ousted McCarthy, Republicans still can't settle on a replacement. Quite a few of the most combative members insisted they would back only Representative Jim Jordan on the floor, including Representative Lauren Boebert, who told reporters, \"I'm ready for somebody who's gonna throw down and not care who's in the way.\"\n\nBoebert's bellicosity reflects a deep strand of the modern congressional Republican self-image, stamped on the party three decades ago by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich. Gingrich brought House Republicans out of 40 years in the political wilderness and into the majority, and he did it by being a prophetic champion of confrontation. From his first congressional race in 1974 all the way through the end of his speakership in 1998, Gingrich was motivated by the belief that confrontation had the power to rescue Americans from their corrupted politics. There was an art, a choreography to this sort of redemptive combativeness, Gingrich thought: \"When you give them confrontations, you get attention; when you get attention, you can educate.\" If they could make their case to the American people, Republicans could stop taking breadcrumbs from the Democrats' table and take over the banquet hall themselves-and run it better.\n\nRead: Steve Scalise bows out\n\nThe GOP's return to the majority came after the 1994 midterms. By now, Gingrich's catechism of confrontation has become an embedded tradition among House Republicans. But as it has been passed down, it has become hollowed out and fetishized. Gingrich's clashes were in service of a party and a positive program. His descendants often seem to want confrontation for its own sake, even as it is ripping their party asunder and pushing policy away from their preferences. If House Republicans want to find their way back to being a functional party-and that is not a given-they will have to master their urge to fight.\n\nThe question of just what kinds of confrontations are worth pursuing was at the heart of the fight last week between Jordan and Representative Steve Scalise, the majority leader and logical next man up. In a secret ballot, the conference narrowly supported Scalise, 113-99, showing that the GOP is genuinely split on the point. That neither Scalise nor Jordan could hope to take a winning vote and automatically turn it into a viable speakership shows that the divide may have become unbridgeable.\n\nBriefly considering the two men's congressional careers helps illuminate what each side is about.\n\nScalise first came to the House after winning a special election in 2008. Although his policy preferences are quite conservative, he has a transactional sensibility and has been a consistent supporter of yearly spending deals. He is someone who likes to dole out trinkets to his colleagues and generally wants to be well liked. Having been nearly assassinated by a left-wing political extremist in 2017, he has sometimes been an eloquent exponent of across-the-aisle goodwill; his return to Congress after recovering from his wounds was one of the few feel-good moments in the House's past decade.\n\nJordan is the walking embodiment of conflict-mindedness. First elected to the House in 2006, just as Republicans returned to the minority, he made a name for himself as a critic of government spending and bailouts (not sparing President George W. Bush from his ire), pushing pro-life ideas and hammering several of Barack Obama's Cabinet members. Jordan's conception of a lawmaker's role has never laid much emphasis on making laws . He relishes representation for its own sake; in 2011, he explained why he planned to remain in the House rather than challenge Sherrod Brown for a spot in the Senate: \"I like that you are here to fight for things you told the voters you are going to fight for.\" For Jordan, an accomplished wrestler as a young man, that means waging a relentless rhetorical struggle against the powers that be. The negative is far more important than the positive.\n\nAfter the Republicans' midterm wave in 2010, Jordan's relentlessness helped get him elected as head of the Republican Study Committee, traditionally a bastion of conservatism in the House. Before long, however, Jordan and many of the most combative members of the GOP conference came to feel that the RSC was no longer conservative enough; specifically, it was too large to provide the cohesiveness needed to take a hard line in negotiations with Republican legislative leaders looking to compromise. To play that role, Jordan and like-minded colleagues including Mark Meadows, Mick Mulvaney, and Ron DeSantis founded the House Freedom Caucus (HFC) after the 2014 midterms. When Speaker John Boehner proved too willing to come to terms with Obama in September 2015, the HFC hounded him into retirement. (Meanwhile, following Jordan's departure from the Study Committee, its next head was Scalise, who would go on to parlay that job into a successful run for minority whip after Majority Leader Eric Cantor was unexpectedly defeated by an outsider primary challenge in 2014.)\n\nRead: 'We put sharp knives in the hands of children'\n\nThe HFC also learned to harmonize with Donald Trump, the outsider critic of the establishment then taking its party by storm. The legislators' initial relationship with Trump was tense, because many preferred Senator Ted Cruz and suspected Trump of being a squish. But as the sharp-elbowed New Yorker gained momentum, HFC members switched horses with real agility. Trump rewarded them by making Mulvaney the head of the powerful Office of Management and Budget. The peak of HFC cooperativeness came in pursuit of tax reform in the fall of 2017.\n\nAfter that, the group's pugnaciousness came back to the fore. Speaker Paul Ryan gave its members hearings but lacked their desired killer instinct in dealing with Nancy Pelosi's Democrats as they went after Trump. The president soon absorbed their sense of embattlement and took them on as confidants; Meadows would become his chief of staff. Jordan, especially, pushed Trump into open conflict with the lame-duck Republican Congress in December 2018 over the question of border funding. Faced with a veto threat from a president who would not accept a clean continuing resolution, the House and Senate never came close to getting on the same page and left the new Congress (including the first Democratic House in eight years) to deal with a partial government shutdown that would eventually last a record 35 days. Trump, who had said he would be \"proud\" to shut down the government in pursuit of border-security funds, eventually decided to accept Democrats' legislative terms while simultaneously acting to circumvent Congress by means of a dubious declaration of national emergency on the southern border, which allowed him to repurpose some funds. Jordan, unsurprisingly, said he supported the president's move \"100 percent.\" Confrontation comes first.\n\nWhen House Republicans have been in the minority, keeping their factions aligned has been a manageable task. All can turn their aggressive energies against Democrats, and those with more inclination toward cutting deals to keep government working can sign onto bipartisan agreements crafted by Democratic leaders. Activists may denounce these members as RINOs-Republicans in Name Only-but among members these tensions are manageable.\n\nWhen Republicans have held the House majority in the post-Tea Party era, however, the tension between the confrontation-minded and the establishment has been radioactive-containable for a time, but ultimately giving rise to fissures. Leading the Republican House is a truly nightmarish job. Boehner lasted nearly five years, which now seems remarkable. Paul Ryan lasted three; Kevin McCarthy, just 270 days. As someone joked , the half-life of Republican Speakers may soon be measured in hours.\n\nGingrich's own speakership gave foreshadowings of this revolution-eating-its-own-children dynamic. His conference in 1995, which included 73 mostly very enthusiastic freshmen, fed on his promises of transforming the federal government through dramatic showdowns. As they teed up an incredibly broad and ambitious slate of bills, Republican legislators sometimes talked as if the American people had elected Gingrich prime minister, with Bill Clinton's presence in the White House regarded as a sort of unfortunate hitch caused by Ross Perot's 1992 run. Republicans, and their speaker, soon learned how little Congress resembles a Westminster Parliament, though. They frequently misjudged what House Republicans were willing to vote for and were even more mystified by their Senate counterparts, who had not gotten the memo about the need for a thoroughgoing revolution. They poured much of their energy into a series of skirmishes over federal spending, expecting Congress's power of the purse to carry the day. Clinton frustrated their ambitions at every turn, vetoing bills but still blaming two successive government shutdowns on congressional Republicans. The prophet of confrontations ironically ended up playing the role of conciliator, begging his own members to accept less than half a loaf in return for reopening the government.\n\nGingrich had taken his career-long pitch against the corrupt Washington establishment and transformed it into an agenda for cutting government. He had forced that transformation onto the congressional agenda and managed to push it through the House. But he showed little ability to bring along all the factions within his own party, let alone the Democratic president. His battles with the president gave him ample opportunity to \"educate\" the American people, but he lacked realistic endgame strategies for dealing with those who remained unpersuaded. His post-shutdown speakership saw him seek out more performative kinds of fights, including a bad bet on impeaching Clinton, while simultaneously securing some important policy victories that fell well short of his promise to roll back the Great Society.\n\nFrom the November 2018 issue: The man who broke politics\n\nWould Jordan, or one of his HFC colleagues, follow Gingrich's trajectory if they ended up with the speakership? It is possible, but whereas Gingrich had an infectious vision of what America ought to be about and was bursting with ideas about how to fix up the government, his successors seem dour and unimaginative in their pugnacity. And whereas Gingrich was a committed Republican team builder, the HFC was in some sense created out of a sense that Republicans needed more internal strife. For Jordan, confrontation seems to be its own reward, and \"small government\" seems to be a slogan as much as a goal to be realized. The HFC's strategy of intransigent resistance to compromise tends to move ultimate policy outcomes to the left by forcing other Republicans to seek terms with Democrats, most analysts agree. Speaker Gingrich would not have approved-and Gingrich as elder statesman has been unsparing in his criticism of the HFC's tactics and unwillingness to rally behind McCarthy.\n\nThere remains, nevertheless, a grain of truth in the HFC's blanket criticism of the establishment. A remarkable portion of legislation that has emerged from Congress in the 21st century has been the result of deals cut by leaders of both parties, with committees and rank-and-file membership both relegated to acting as eleventh-hour ratifiers rather than real collaborators in the legislative process. Allowing more disputes to play out in the political arena, as Representative Matt Gaetz called for when he led the charge against McCarthy, would indeed be healthy for our democracy. But if that path is to ever favor conservatives, they will need to change their approach to conflict. They need to realize that, rather than just \"educating\" the public and hoping to sweep all opposition before them, to make the most of their roles as legislators they must turn their sights to their fellow representatives. Confrontation must be in service of persuasion, and win-win conciliation must be an ever-present possibility.\n\nThe deep logic of Congress and its place in our constitutional system ought to call Republican lawmakers in this direction. All the drama in 2023 could represent a first step down the path. But the road ahead is long."

      "text": "The Sin the House Freedom Caucus Couldn't Forgive\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene is no longer radical enough for the GOP's radical fringe.\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene has been called many things, but she has never been called a moderate squish.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThe U.S. representative from Georgia was apparently kicked out of the House Freedom Caucus, the hard-right group famous for bedeviling Republican House speakers, in a vote last month, Politico first reported . Representative Andy Harris, a board member, told several outlets about the outcome. The HFC says it does not comment on membership, and Greene released a statement that did not specifically address the expulsion but said, \"In Congress, I serve Northwest Georgia first, and serve no group in Washington.\"\n\nRead: Why is Marjorie Taylor Greene like this?\n\nGreene was not ejected for subscribing to QAnon beliefs , or for encouraging violence against colleagues, or for blaming wildfires on Jewish space lasers , or for supporting Vladimir Putin . Instead, Harris said, Greene was punished for tangling with her fellow HFC member Lauren Boebert of Colorado and daring to take a minimal step toward governance by aligning herself with Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a conservative Republican. The vote shows just how radical the MAGA fringe in Congress is today-a wild-eyed clique implacably opposed to governance .\n\nWhen Greene entered Congress in 2021, she was viewed, correctly, as wacky and toxic. In February of that year, Democrats moved to kick her out of her formal committee assignments after McCarthy hesitated to punish her for offensive remarks. But Greene used the ensuing two years to build her power within the party. She forged an alliance with McCarthy: It saved her from pariahdom and made her a major face of the party, and it gave him credibility (or at least cover) with right-wing members. When his bid for the speakership nearly faltered in January 2023, she was a crucial backer. And when McCarthy needed votes for the debt deal he struck with President Joe Biden in May, Greene was there.\n\nBut the closeness to McCarthy, whom the right views as an unreliable and moderate speaker, and support for the debt deal was too much for her HFC colleagues to bear, according to Politico 's reporting. The fury over the debt deal is silly. McCarthy never had much leverage to bring against Biden, and he managed to extract more from the White House than many Democrats would have liked. The alternative to the deal he struck wasn't a better deal-it was a catastrophic national default. Greene's sin, to HFC members, was insufficient nihilism.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Marjorie Taylor Greene is just a symptom of what ails the GOP\n\nThe idea that Greene has become some sort of moderate is belied by the other reason she was kicked out. Last month on the House floor, she called Boebert \"a little bitch\"-amid a disagreement over competing resolutions to impeach Biden. (A typically unrepentant Greene defended her word choice to Semafor , explaining , \"She has genuinely been a nasty little bitch to me.\" Boebert, for her part, said that she had defended Greene's comments on free-speech grounds ahead of the caucus vote.)\n\nGreene is as extreme as she ever has been, but she became prominent not just for her \"loony lies and conspiracy theories\"-to use Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's phrase-but for her savvy wielding of those views in the press to get attention. But some of the remaining members of the Freedom Caucus, although not so well known, have terrifying views of their own.\n\nThe chair, Scott Perry, a Pennsylvanian, was a key plotter of Donald Trump's attempted paperwork coup to steal the 2020 election, and has been swept up in Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigation . Jim Jordan of Ohio, the chief inquisitor of the House majority, is the vice chair. Andy Biggs of Arizona responded to Donald Trump's federal indictment in June by tweeting , \" We have now reached a war phase. Eye for an eye.\" His colleague Clay Higgins of Louisiana outdid him with a m é lange of militia vernacular incomprehensible to the average citizen . Mary Miller of Illinois first reached national attention in 2021 when she told rally attendees, \" Hitler was right on one thing: He said, 'Whoever has the youth has the future.'\" She may not have intended to praise Hitler; the same cannot safely be assumed about Paul Gosar of Arizona, who is deeply entwined with neo-Nazis and white supremacists . Matt Gaetz of Florida is, well, Matt Gaetz.\n\nJeff Sharlet: The congressman telling Trump supporters to \"buckle up\"\n\nWhen Greene was kicked off her committees back in 2021, I argued that the GOP was disingenuously treating her as one lone, unhinged figure who could be ignored. The problem for Republican leaders was that they couldn't very well punish her for views that the party had tolerated and fostered.\n\nA little more than two years later, the center of the House congressional caucus has moved so far that Greene is no longer a fringe member-in fact, the fringe members view her as an avatar of compromise and weakness. That's no longer just a problem for Republican leaders. It's a problem for the entire country."

Lauren Boebert reportedly tried to kick a \"guy\" out of a women's restroom in the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, only to realize she'd made a mistake.\n\nCongressional leaders were voting on the House floor when the far-right representative reportedly came \"bursting\" out of a nearby women's restroom and complained to security that there was \"a guy\" inside, Bloomberg reporter Billy House wrote in a series of posts on X.\n\nTransgender people are banned from using single-sex facilities that align with their gender identities near the House Chamber under a policy first introduced by Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.).\n\nHouse said Boebert brought Mace over to help sniff out the supposed intruder.\n\nRecalling the scene, House said he waited outside the restroom after seeing Boebert and Mace storm back in. He saw four people leave after her, all women.\n\nBack on the House floor, Boebert falsely told colleagues that the person she saw was Rep. Sarah McBride (D-Del.), the Daily Beast reported, citing sources present. McBride, who was not in the restroom, is the first transgender member of Congress and the target of Mace's bathroom ban.\n\n\"You shouldn't be here,\" Boebert said she told the person in the women's room, according to the Daily Beast.\n\nAfter reporting the incident to colleagues, House said Boebert returned to the restroom with Mace. Both entered the room but \"just seconds\" later, they \"quietly\" exited and returned to the House floor, he wrote.\n\nHouse said he questioned Boebert about what happened and said she admitted that she hadn't seen \"a guy\" after all.\n\n\"I apologized, learned a lesson, and it won't happen again,\" she said in a statement to the Daily Beast.\n\nA spokesperson for McBride chastised the two lawmakers for their behavior.\n\n\"What a thoroughly predictable ― and predicted ― outcome,\" Michaela Kurinsky-Malos told HuffPost on Friday. \"Rep. McBride thinks people should get back to work rather than play bathroom police.\"\n\nRepresentatives for Boebert and Mace did not immediately respond to HuffPost's requests for comment Friday.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Al Green (D-Texas) for heckling and pointing his cane toward Donald Trump during the president's speech to a joint session of Congress last week.\n\nBoebert, during an interview on the right-wing Real America's Voice, first sought to memory-hole her own interruptions of then-President Joe Biden 's speech to Congress in 2022.\n\nShe said: \"You had some folks on the left trying to come out early and defend this behavior and compare it to an image of Marjorie Taylor Greene and myself, who were chanting 'Build the wall' while all other Republicans were chanting the same phrase and they just got that one image and acted like we completely disrupted the State of the Union.\"\n\nThis was the image in question:\n\n\"But Al Green was given multiple opportunities to stand down, to sit down, to behave, to show decorum. And he did not,\" she continued.\n\nBoebert then said: \"For him to go and shake his pimp cane at President Trump was absolutely abhorrent.\"\n\nCritics reminded Boebert of her infamous moment with Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nLauren Boebert says Rep. Al Green shook his \"pimp cane\" at Trump 🤔 Effortless racism\n\nThey also recalled that time she was removed from a \"Beetlejuice\" musical for vaping and groping her then-date during a performance of the show.\n\nAnd they ripped her for describing the stick that Green, who is Black, wielded at Trump as a \"pimp cane.\"\n\nIt's not a pimp cane. It's a cane. Al Green is a politician who uses a tool to help him walk, just like many of his constituents who are dependent on Medicaid assistance. Lauren Boebert is being ableist with her statements.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Lauren Boebert Doubles Down On Condemned Comment About Black Lawmaker, Makes It Worse\n\nReporter, HuffPost\n\nFar-right Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) has gone all in on her \"pimp cane\" insult of Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), who is Black.\n\nBoebert last week sparked anger as she conveniently sidestepped her own previous rowdy conduct in the House chamber and ripped Green for heckling and pointing his cane toward Donald Trump during the president's speech to a joint session of Congress.\n\n\"For him to go and shake his pimp cane at President Trump was absolutely abhorrent,\" Boebert clutched her pearls at the time.\n\nBoebert on Tuesday told Real America's Voice: \"I stand by it.\"\n\nShe first questioned Green's use of the cane. \"I have never seen Al Green actually use his cane as a support to walk. I have seen him shake it for years all throughout the Capitol during any meeting that I've ever been present with him in.\"\n\n\"If that gold-plated cane isn't a pimp cane, I don't know what is,\" she continued.\n\nBoebert then hit back at Rep. Chrissy Houlahan's (D-Pa.) attempt to censure her over the remarks, which Houlahan described as \" disparaging, derogatory, and racist toward another colleague .\"\n\nBoebert suggested: \"Maybe Houla-who is really the racist here. Are only Blacks pimps? Is that what I'm hearing? Are there no cisgender, white pimps in America?\"\n\nWatch here:\n\nLauren Boebert says the censure motion against her is unjust after she said that Rep. Al Green carries a \"pimp cane\", and argues that it wasn't a racist comment: \"Are only blacks pimps?

      "text": "Lauren Boebert Facing Off Against Republican Opponents In Colorado Primary\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nOne of the most notorious Republicans in Congress faces a crowded primary election on Tuesday.\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) is running against five other Republicans in Colorado's 4th District.\n\nIt's not her district - Boebert currently represents Colorado's 3rd - but she's making the switch rather than face a rematch against Adam Frisch, the Democratic challenger who came surprisingly close to beating her in 2022 . Boebert said she'd run in the 4th District, which leans more Republican than her own, after former Rep. Ken Buck (R) announced his retirement.\n\nIn her first term in Congress, Boebert drew attention with a streak of inflammatory antics, such as vowing to tote a handgun around Washington, calling a Muslim colleague a terrorist and heckling President Joe Biden with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) during the 2022 State of the Union address. Frisch labeled Boebert a purveyor of \" angertainment .\"\n\nIn her second term, Boebert clashed with Greene after the two introduced rival impeachment resolutions against Biden in June 2023. Greene told reporters Boebert \"basically copied my articles,\" which Boebert denied.\n\n\"I'm not in middle school,\" Boebert told HuffPost at the time.\n\nThat evening, Greene called Boebert \"a little bitch\" during a confrontation on the House floor, a breach of decorum that contributed to Greene's ouster from the right-wing House Freedom Caucus the following month.\n\nBoebert committed her own breach of decorum months later when she was escorted out of a Denver theater in September after vaping and carrying on with a date during a performance of the \"Beetlejuice\" musical.\n\nThis year, Boebert has seemingly tried to distinguish herself from Greene. During a House Oversight Committee hearing that fell into chaos after Greene insulted a Democratic colleague's \"fake eyelashes,\" Boebert tried to strike a more statesmanlike tone, apologizing to the American people on Greene's behalf.\n\n\"It was embarrassing what was going on,\" Boebert said the next day. \"My apology was sincere because I felt shame that that was happening.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump endorsed Boebert over her five Republican opponents earlier this year.\n\nBoebert may have an advantage due to her name recognition and Trump endorsement, but political handicappers have said the bad attention she draws to herself, such as by getting kicked out of a touring Broadway performance, hurts her chances.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) won the Republican primary election in Colorado's 4th Congressional District on Tuesday.\n\nBoebert beat five other Republicans and will face the winner of Tuesday's Democratic primary in the general election for the seat vacated by former Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), who retired early this year.\n\nBoebert bailed on her own district, Colorado's 3rd, after barely surviving a challenge from Democrat Adam Frisch in 2022. Buck's district leans more Republican and may give Boebert a better shot of prevailing in November.\n\nBut Boebert's baggage has only gotten heavier since she first brought her gun-toting brand to Congress in 2021. Last fall, she was ejected from a Denver performance of the touring Broadway musical \"Beetlejuice\" for vaping and causing a ruckus with a male companion. She denied vaping during the performance, but security footage showed she had.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Rep. Lauren Boebert Grilled About Carpetbagging During 1st Debate In New District\n\nFORT LUPTON, Colo. (AP) - Republican primary candidate Mike Lynch didn't sugarcoat the question to his opponent on the crammed debate stage, Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, who hopped into the race last month partly over fear of a loss in the district she currently represents.\n\n\"Could you give the definition of 'carpetbagger?'\" Lynch asked to low murmurs from the crowd at the first Republican primary debate in Fort Lupton, a community in Colorado's 4th District.\n\nIt was expected. The candidate before Lynch had asked the same question, if more delicately put. The accusation had already been lobbed at Boebert after she joined the packed primary race, escaping a rematch against Democrat Adam Frisch, who nearly beat her in the last election.\n\nWith Republicans hanging onto control of the U.S. House by their fingertips, Republicans and Democrats are wrestling fiercely over every close race. That includes the seat Boebert holds in Colorado's 3rd District, which was considered solidly leaning to the GOP but changed to a toss-up for this year after Boebert won by only 546 votes in 2022.\n\nThe updated assessment partly prompted her flight to the new district and the criticisms that followed. On stage, Boebert didn't hesitate in response to the attack.\n\n\"The crops may be different in Colorado's 4th District but the values are not, and I'm a proven fighter for the values that you all believe in,\" said Boebert, her voice forceful over the wide room in a recreation center.\n\nThe crowd, a who's who of local Republicans and voters, sat around tables where red popped among dark suits, including red solo cups and Boebert's signature lipstick.\n\nBoebert built herself into a household name with a style of pugilistic politics that has turned otherwise tame moments in Congress into slugfests, along with hard-liner conservative stances and unwavering loyalty to former President Donald Trump .\n\nWhile Colorado's congressional representatives do not have to live in the district they represent, only the state, Boebert is moving to Weld County in her new district, jokingly described by the moderator as \"the most heavily Republican seat on the planet Earth.\"\n\nThe corner of the Great Plains is a sweep of prairie grass and farms broken only by ranching towns where auctioneers chant the weight and price of cattle near every week. Voters supported Trump by nearly 20 percentage points in 2020, more than double the margin in Boebert's old district.\n\nJerry Sonnenberg, a popular former state senator with a tactically deployed baritone, was among the six of nine candidates on stage who raised their hands when asked if they had been arrested, to raucous applause.\n\nAnother, Rep. Richard Holtorf, the Republican whip in the Colorado House, has been most outspoken about Boebert's move. Deborah Flora, a filmmaker and radio host, was the first to levy her question of switching districts at Boebert on stage.\n\nState Rep. Lynch also exchanged barbs with Boebert. Lynch was Colorado's House minority leader until he stepped down Wednesday after a 2022 arrest for drunken driving came to light, an issue that was largely met with forgiveness by fellow contestants.\n\nBoebert was caught on video vaping and groping with a date in a Denver theater in September, but the embarrassing episode went unmentioned at the debate.\n\nStill, the scandal may be hard to shake in Boebert's new electoral stomping grounds, where voters hold tight to conservative Christian values some feel she transgressed.\n\nThe congresswoman must rely on her national name and convince skeptical voters that her voice is needed in Congress more than those of her homegrown opponents, some of whom have lived in the district their entire lives and represent parts of the area in Colorado's Legislature.\n\nBoebert focused on her experience in Congress as the key factor separating her from the candidates on stage.\n\n\"Everyone will talk like a Freedom Caucus member but there is only one who governs as a Freedom Caucus member,\" she said. \"I am here to earn your support, earn your vote. This is not a coronation.\"\n\nBoebert's primary rivals largely seemed hesitant to directly attack her onstage, which was reminiscent of the Republican presidential primary candidates who avoided criticism of Trump in early debates.\n\nThe debate also largely centered on national political issues including border security, abortion and fentanyl, on which Boebert could laud her stubbornly conservative voting record. Her opponents didn't raise local issues they may have thought she was unprepared to represent.\n\nBefore switching districts, Boebert had been expected to face a rematch against Frisch, who had already raised more money than she had.\n\nPolitical experts generally agree Republicans have a better chance of holding onto the 3rd District without Boebert in the race.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

(Gage Skidmore / Wikimedia Commons)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nRepublican firebrand Representative Lauren Boebert last week began spearheading a package of amendments that could both gut landmark climate legislation and enrich her husband's fossil fuel business.\n\nDuring the first markup of Democrats' reconciliation bill, the first-term Colorado congresswoman authored several initiatives designed to block higher fees for drilling on federal lands and for methane emissions.\n\nTerra Energy Partners, a Houston-based oil and gas company that drills on federal lands, paid Boebert's husband, Jayson, roughly $940,000 in 2019 and 2020 as a consultant, according to her latest financial disclosure report. Boebert failed to disclose her husband's 2019 work for Terra Energy Partners in her congressional financial disclosure form filed last year.\n\nLast month, Terra Energy told the Colorado Sun that Boebert's husband \"has provided contract drilling services as an on-site drilling foreman to Terra since 2017.\"\n\nTerra Energy has paid Jayson Boebert through a consulting company, Boebert Consulting. Lauren Boebert has her own ties to the company: She was previously named as the registered agent of an LLC that is the current registered agent for Boebert Consulting in Colorado corporate records.\n\nBoebert's office did not respond to a request for comment about the amendments.\n\nAs of last year, 134 members of Congress owned up to $93 million of stock in fossil fuel corporations. Boebert's ties to the industry are among the most direct of any lawmaker in Congress.\n\nSince winning office in 2020, Boebert has helped fossil fuel industry lobbyists push measures to weaken climate policy. Her latest amendments emerged in the House Natural Resources Committee, which is writing climate- and energy-related portions of Democrats' $3.5 trillion infrastructure reconciliation package.\n\nAll of the amendments were voted down, but they could resurface when the infrastructure bill moves to the House floor and the Senate.\n\nOne of Boebert's amendments would have eliminated a provision of the legislation subjecting fossil fuel companies to new fees when their fracking operations emit methane.\n\nBoebert also introduced three separate amendments to block another part of the bill that would increase royalties on onshore oil and gas drilling on federal land from 12.5 to 20 percent, create new bonding requirements for oil and gas companies (ensuring they have money to clean up abandoned infrastructure in case of bankruptcy), and levy fines on companies that do not clean up abandoned wells.\n\nTerra Energy operates some of its drilling operations on federal lands.\n\nIn 2018, the company pushed to drill on public lands in western Colorado. In early September, the Bureau of Land Management approved new natural gas drilling leases for the company on federal land in the area. The company and its subsidiaries own more than 5,500 natural gas wells in Boebert's district. Terra Energy ranks fourth in total methane emissions among US oil and gas companies.\n\nEarlier this year, Boebert introduced legislation to reverse President Joe Biden's executive order halting new leases for oil and gas drilling on federal land. Despite the moratorium on new leases, the administration has approved drilling permits on already-leased public land at a faster rate than any president since George W. Bush.\n\nA federal judge struck down Biden's leasing moratorium this summer, and while the administration is appealing the ruling, in the meantime, it has reopened the leasing process.\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Daily Poster , here .\n\nJulia Rock is a reporter for the Daily Poster .\n\nAndrew Perez is a writer and researcher living in Maine.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Mainstream outlets like the New York Times and Washington Post have noted that, since at least some of these candidates are likely to win their races, they will create the most diverse GOP congressional delegation since Reconstruction.\n\nThese candidates come from racial and ethnic groups not typically associated with the GOP. For example, there's Anna Paulina Luna in Florida's 13th Congressional District, which encompasses St Petersburg and the surrounding area. Luna is a Latina and a conservative, critical of what she calls \"illegal immigration\" (though her comments are considerably less virulently racist than some of her Republican counterparts, including Lauren Boebert, who recently endorsed her). Wesley Hunt, a black man running in Texas's 38th Congressional District in the Houston metro area, favors what he calls \"border security\" and supports \"our men and women in blue,\" who must be defended against \"radical liberals in Congress.\"\n\nOf the 435 Republicans running for the House of Representatives, sixty-seven are people of color. This number doesn't reflect the racial demographics of the United States. But it does represent a significant effort on the part of the GOP to diversify their candidates and their party.\n\nOur legislative bodies should, of course, be more diverse. It isn't just morally correct; more elected officials of color can make our governments better at advancing progressive priorities. But Democrats too often treat racial, gender, sexual, and other representation as if it were a final victory. Which, for many of them, it is: the party has sought diverse faces in high places to carry out an agenda that leaves the miserably unequal status quo untouched.\n\nVoters of color aren't stupid. They've realized this approach is hollow at best, a multiracial cover for political misdeeds at worst - which has helped lead to a situation in which the GOP, pursuing an agenda that is dangerous to the working class, immigrants, queer and transgender people, black people, the environment, and much more, doesn't seem like such a bad gamble.\n\nThe GOP's goal in nominating a more diverse set of candidates is to challenge a key Democratic strategy in the US electorate. Winning an overwhelming majority of the black vote has been crucial to Democratic electoral victories for several decades, particularly in cities and metropolitan areas where black people and people of color in general disproportionately live in the United States. Even in regions where these groups are minorities, carrying 80 to 95 percent of the black vote can catapult a Democrat to victory. When this turnout is less than expected or hoped, Democratic victories become chancier or impossible.\n\nThis is one of the many double binds the mainstream of the Democratic Party has put itself in: it not only relies on the support of black voters but is simultaneously trying to poach more conservative white voters from Republicans. When the Republicans respond in kind, trying to entice more people of color to their side, mainstream commentators get confused: this is not supposed to be possible.\n\nFor years, mainstream commentators heralded a coming \" demographic wave ,\" when people of color would be the majority in the United States and white people a plurality, making the country \"majority minority.\" If you've convinced yourself that demographics equal destiny and people of color \"naturally\" vote for the Democrats, Democratic victories appear inevitable. This argument was everywhere during the Trump administration, reassuring Democrats that their eventual return to permanent power was settled social scientific fact.\n\nThis narrative has proved to be both misguided and racist. First, it relied on the assumption that Latinos - the fastest-growing ethnic group in the United States - would always identify as Democrats - something that isn't borne out by the data.\n\nSecond, it assumed that the GOP wouldn't, or couldn't, offer any kind of alternative to the mainstream of the Democratic Party that people of color would support. This has also proven false. While people of color still vote disproportionately for Democrats, the 2020 election revealed that rule to be as malleable as any other. Donald Trump actually gained ground among minority voters during his reelection campaign, despite four years of racist fearmongering, political violence, and his alliance with the far right.\n\nThese essentialist assumptions fall into precisely the kind of racist tropes that the Democrats claim to oppose, assuming a kind of static, intrinsic, across-the-board progressive bent to voters of color. But like all essentialist assumptions, this is wrong.\n\nFor example, while black voters in the United States have moved left on the issue over time, a majority of them still find abortion to be \"morally unacceptable.\" Another supermajority of black voters, the highest proportion of all racial groups polled, said that gender was permanently determined by ones' assigned sex at birth, squarely at odds with both trans rights activists and the position of the Democratic Party. A majority of Hispanic voters in Flordia support conservative governor Ron DeSantis's racist actions against undocumented immigrants, which saw the state government intentionally lie to a group of immigrants and put them on a plane to Martha's Vineyard in an arguably illegal political stunt.\n\nThe coalition that currently votes for Democrats in the United States is contingent and malleable. The GOP can win over members of that coalition in their favor - perhaps especially if Democrats continue pursuing a politics that treats racial representation as if it were the full extent of their program for racial justice.\n\nAnother clear example of this inadequacy is the ascension of Rishi Sunak in the United Kingdom, the country's first ever prime minister who is not white. President Joe Biden and other commentators have hailed his election as an historic moment but have neglected to mention that Sunak's being of South Asian descent or being the descendant of immigrants doesn't mean that he or his party will support freedom of movement or the provision of increased rights for migrants. In fact, it seems that his government is poised to enact the same kinds of reactionary policies that previous Conservative governments have throughout the UK's history.\n\nEven the extreme right wing, which in the United States has always been deeply tied to white supremacism, has in countries from Brazil to India been accompanied by very different politics of race and ethnicity. The Brazilian Integralist Action , Brazil's fascist party from the 1930s, had many non-white members and also several regional leaders who were black, even as it was aligning itself with European fascists. And recently defeated Jair Bolsonaro fared surprisingly well with non-white voters in Brazil despite his open racism. In India the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh , a Hindu nationalist organization deeply connected to both the country's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and to networks of far-right militants, espouses a form of nationalism and racism that is focused on religious sectarianism rather than whiteness. Even the Italian National Fascist Party originally avoided the antisemitic policies that obsessed the Nazis, only later adopting them when pressured by their allies.\n\nA politics of empty racial representation that does not actually advance any sort of substantively progressive politics and leaves out the basic, material issues affecting the lives of Democrats' most important and most oppressed constituents presents the Right with a golden opportunity - one that Republicans are currently seizing.\n\nCraig Johnson has a PhD in history from the University of California Berkeley, where his work focused on the right wing and the Catholic Church in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Spain. He hosts a podcast called Fifteen Minutes of Fascism , a weekly news and analysis show covering the global rise of the radical right.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

On the contrary: the super PAC behind House Republicans who opposed the election results took in more money than before the January 6 capitol riot.\n\nA man with a \"Stop the Steal\" sign stands in front of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 in Washington, DC.

The Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF), which supports GOP House candidates, raised substantially more than it did during the 2019 election cycle at this time, with big donations from oil companies, billionaires, and undisclosed sources.\n\nThe two super PACs represent one of the most effective avenues for wealthy donors and corporate interests to pump money into the national GOP. The groups are not subject to any contribution limits, and thanks to consistently weak campaign finance law enforcement, super PACs have become key elements of the party infrastructure, working closely with political parties and candidates.\n\nDuring the 2020 election, CLF and SLF spent roughly $437 million to promote Republican candidates and tear down their Democratic opponents, according to OpenSecrets.\n\nThe groups' efforts didn't slow down after last year's election. According to their most recent filings, CLF raised nearly $12 million between January and June this year, while SLF raised just over $6 million . CLF saw a substantial increase in donations compared to this time period last election cycle, when it raised over $8 million . The SLF raised about the same amount it did then: just under $6 million .\n\nOn January 7, a majority of GOP House lawmakers voted to overturn the presidential election results in either Pennsylvania or Arizona - and many of those congress people were able to do so because of the efforts of CLF.\n\nThe super PAC spent nearly $143 million last election helping Republican House members and attacking their opponents, including aiding the campaigns of nineteen representatives who voted in January, hours after the insurrection, to sustain objections to the electoral college results. More than half of GOP lawmakers who benefited from CLF spending in 2020 objected to the presidential election results in Arizona or Pennsylvania.\n\nThat included Colorado Republican Lauren Boebert; last year, CLF spent more than $900,000 on TV ads boosting her successful campaign for Colorado's 3rd congressional district. After Boebert won, she voted to overturn the results of the presidential election. She's still calling for an audit, many months later.\n\nCLF also told donors last November, in a memo obtained by Politico , that it spent about $3.5 million to help Republican Stephanie Bice win an upset against incumbent Rep. Kendra Horn (D-OK). Bice would go on to vote to overturn President Joe Biden's victory.\n\nIn some cases, Republican lawmakers' campaigns were almost entirely bankrolled by CLF. The super PAC spent over $15 million boosting Reps. Nicole Malliotakis of New York, Burgess Owens of Utah, and Troy Nehls of Texas. All of them voted to overturn the election results. In addition to ad spending, CLF ran field programs and canvassing operations for the candidates.\n\nCLF wrote in its memo that it \"carried the entire GOP TV advertising presence\" in Nehls's race and CLF \"carried nearly all GOP advertising\" for Malliotakis.\n\nSLF, meanwhile, has aided the campaigns of three senators who objected to the 2020 election results: Sens. Rick Scott (R-FL), and Josh Hawley (R-MO) who were elected in 2018, and Roger Marshall (R-KS) who won his seat last year.\n\nDespite CLF and SLF's associations with lawmakers who voted to overturn the election, the super PACs haven't seen any fundraising problems since Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in January.\n\nDuring the first half of the year, for example, the groups took in big donations from fossil fuel companies. CLF received $1 million from OTA Holdings, a subsidiary of the Louisiana oil and gas company Enterprise Products Partners, and $500,000 from Chevron. WPX Energy, an oil and gas company that recently merged with Devon Energy, gave $250,000 to the House committee, while Valero Energy gave $100,000.\n\nSLF, meanwhile, received nearly $2.8 million from oil and gas companies, including the $2 million donation from Occidental on the day of the insurrection, as well as $625,000 from Chevron and $150,000 from the Colorado-based Ovintiv USA.\n\nSome of the money coming into CLF has been dark money. The group received about $3.5 million, or 30 percent of its haul so far this year, from American Action Network, an affiliated nonprofit that doesn't have to disclose its donors.\n\nCLF also received nearly $3 million from five billionaires: Ken Griffin, the CEO of Citadel LLC ($1 million); Paul Singer, co-CEO of Elliott Management ($1 million); investment banker Warren Stephens ($500,000); Robert Rowling, the founder of TRT Holdings, which owns Omni Hotels and used to own Gold's Gym ($250,000); and businessman Philip Anschutz ($125,000).\n\nHillwood Development, the commercial real estate firm founded by Ross Perot Jr, donated $1 million to CLF.\n\nOther top individual donors included Ronald Cameron ($250,000), the owner and CEO of the poultry company Mountaire Farms, and Walter Buckley Jr ($228,100), the CEO of the venture capital firm Actua Corporation. Cameron also gave $250,000 to the SLF.\n\nCorporate interests also continued donating to the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA), which supports GOP candidates in state attorneys general races, after its nonprofit arm helped direct people to the January 6 protest preceding the insurrection at the Capitol.\n\nRAGA received corporate donations from AT&T ($125,000), Anheuser-Busch ($105,000), Pfizer ($51,000), T-Mobile ($50,000), Postmates ($40,000), and Mastercard ($25,000).\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Daily Poster , here .\n\nThis article previously stated that TRT Holdings owns Gold's Gym, but Gold's Gym was sold to RSG Group last year.\n\nAndrew Perez is a writer and researcher living in Maine.\n\nJulia Rock is a contributing writer for the Daily Poster .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn response to the violent insurrection at the US Capitol, the Charles Schwab Corporation yesterday announced it will shut down its political action committee, which gave less than a quarter million dollars to Republican lawmakers in 2020.\n\n\"In light of a divided political climate and an increase in attacks on those participating in the political process,\" the company said, \"we believe a clear and apolitical position is in the best interest of our clients, employees, stockholders and the communities in which we operate.\"\n\nWhile the news generated headlines , the company did not respond to questions from the Daily Poster about whether it will review or try to restrict the much larger political contributions made by the company's billionaire chairman Charles Schwab.\n\nDuring the 2020 election, the firm's namesake donated more than $9 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) and the Senate Leadership Fund (SLF), the two main party-aligned super PACs supporting House and Senate GOP lawmakers. A majority of House Republicans, 139 of them, voted to overturn the election results, while Republican leaders in the Senate were still endorsing Donald Trump's right to challenge the election results after media outlets had already called the race.\n\nSchwab is no anomaly: Name-brand companies have issued press releases about halting or reviewing the relatively small PAC donations to the lawmakers who egged on the mayhem. However, the Daily Poster contacted scores of companies linked to top SLF and CLF donors , and virtually none committed to taking steps to restrict top corporate officials from continuing to make far larger donations to the super PACs that bankroll congressional Republicans.\n\nHalting PAC donations while doing nothing to stop corporate titans' bigger super PAC donations is a head fake: The maneuver lets companies clean their reputations by pretending they are taking decisive actions to punish insurrectionist Republicans, even though they will not stop corporate officials from recapitalizing the slush fund that those lawmakers will rely on for reelection. And the vast majority of these companies do not publicly disclose if and when they make donations to dark money groups that also spend on elections.\n\nThe bait and switch is underscored by the data: SLF and CLF together raised more than $578 million to support Republican lawmakers in the 2020 election, while their affiliated dark money nonprofits, One Nation and American Action Network, spent another $50 million on unregulated TV ads, according to OpenSecrets.\n\nBy comparison, all corporate PACs combined donated less than half that amount to Republican congressional candidates in the 2020 election, and those contributions comprise an all-time low of just 5 percent of all campaign donations in 2020.\n\nAn election in Colorado illustrates how the CLF often plays a far more direct role than PAC donations in supporting insurrectionist Republicans. Freshman Rep. Lauren Boebert, who voted against certifying the presidential election and refuses to walk through Capitol metal detectors , was boosted by more than $900,000 of spending by CLF and only received $20,000 from business PACs .\n\n\"Are these corporations saying they're no longer donating their $5,000 max corporate PAC checks to Republicans or saying they're no longer doing bundling and financing million-dollar super PACs on behalf of Republicans?\" asked Justice Democrats' Waleed Shahid , whose organization works to elect progressive lawmakers. \"Big difference.\"\n\nThat difference explains the dissonance between exuberant media headlines heralding the end of PAC donations and quiet reassurances that there will be no interruption of the much larger flood of cash funding the GOP's political apparatus. Indeed, most corporations contacted by aides to GOP House Leader Kevin McCarthy - who voted to block the election results - \"have assured them that they have no plans to back away from the party,\" according to Politico .\n\n\"This is a temporary issue that will quickly disappear when corporate America sees how extreme the agenda is of the Democrats who now have complete unchecked power in Washington,\" one GOP lawmaker told the Hill . \"They will be running to [the National Republican Campaign Committee] and CLF by March or April.\"\n\nThe Daily Poster contacted roughly ninety companies and interest groups that either directly donated or whose officials contributed to the CLF and SLF, accounting for roughly $370 million raised by the groups last cycle.\n\nAmong the organizations donating directly from their treasuries to CLF and SLF were the National Association of Realtors, ConocoPhillips, and Boeing, which have all said they are reviewing their donations. None of the companies have pledged to permanently stop donating to the Republican super PACs.\n\nThe National Association of Realtors said that its PAC met this week and the \"association is temporarily pausing federal political disbursements.\" The organization, which directly contributed $6.6 million to SLF last cycle, said it \"will continue to closely monitor events in Washington in the days and weeks ahead in order to ensure our political participation most closely represents the will of our REALTOR® members and the best interests of American real estate.\"\n\n\"Given the current environment, we are not making political contributions at this time,\" Boeing announced on Wednesday, in a statement that appeared to cover its PAC contributions. Boeing made $750,000 worth of corporate contributions to SLF, including $250,000 in mid-November, as the group turned its sights on the two Georgia senate runoff races.\n\nConocoPhillips, which directly donated $1.3 million to the groups, said: \"In light of Congress's recent vote on the certification of the electoral college results, ConocoPhillips has suspended all political contributions for at least six months. While the company has a robust governance for political contributions, we are actively reviewing our current policies.\"\n\nThe Daily Poster reached out to several companies that have said they are halting or reviewing their PAC donations and that contributed to the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA) last election cycle.\n\nRepublican attorneys general in seventeen states sought to invalidate the election results in at least four swing states, and RAGA's nonprofit arm helped direct people to the protest at the US Capitol last week that preceded the insurrection.\n\n\"Future political donations are under review based on the events of the past few weeks,\" said a spokesperson for CVS Health, which donated $50,000 to RAGA last year, according to data from Political MoneyLine.\n\nCoca-Cola, which donated $100,000, said the company is \"reviewing our participation in groups like the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA), and we will continue to do so with last week's events in mind.\"\n\nNone of the companies contacted by t he Daily Poster pledged to restrict donations by their senior officials. A few firms argued that their corporate officials are simply making their own contribution decisions.\n\nA spokesperson for Elliott Management, whose founder and co-CEO Paul Singer contributed $7 million to SLF and CLF, said: \"You seem to be referring to donations made by individual employees in their capacity as private citizens - these are not corporate decisions.\"\n\nLegal experts told t he Daily Poster that, in general, corporations can restrict executives political donations as a condition of employment - and in fact some companies assure investors that their executives' donations are reviewed and approved by the companies so they don't trip over anti-corruption rules and avoid potential reputational damage.\n\n\"If they say that they are reviewing [donations], they do have the ability to influence,\" said Jay Dubow, a former SEC regulator who now advises corporations on compliance. \"If it has to be reviewed then there's a veto [power].\"\n\n\"I can't think of anything that would stop a company from telling executives not to make political contributions, or from requiring pre-approval of any political contributions,\" said Brendan Fischer, the director of federal reform at Campaign Legal Center. He added that, with some exceptions, \"in most private sector, non-unionized workplaces, the law does not stop employers from firing workers for their political views or activities, including for their record of political contributions.\"\n\nCompanies' new attempt to feign ignorance and powerlessness about their officials' donations obscures how corporate and individual contributions often work in tandem. A recent study from Northwestern University researchers found that executives' political contributions are driven by business considerations.\n\n\"The likelihood of an individual corporate leader donating to a member of Congress increased by 11 percent when that legislator received a committee assignment making him or her 'policy relevant' to the donor's company,\" the analysis concluded . \"The likelihood of a corporate executive donating to a sitting member of Congress was 31 percent higher during election cycles in which that executive's company was actively lobbying the federal government.\"\n\nBruce Freed - whose organization, the Center for Political Accountability, encourages companies to disclose their political contributions - said firms \"need to have policies and procedures in place to protect the company and to protect themselves from the risk they face from election-related spending.\"\n\n\"At this point, companies are facing existential risks by having any association with the insurrection attempt of last Wednesday, but also any association with the congressmen who voted to overturn the election results or the attorneys general who were involved in the lawsuits to overturn the election results,\" he said.\n\nFreed noted that many companies are only talking about reviewing or halting their PAC donations, which are limited to $5,000 per candidate, rather than contributions to groups like super PACs, dark money nonprofits, trade associations, and 527 committees - which can accept donations of any size, including money direct from corporate treasuries.\n\nMoreover, most political donations - more than 70 percent since 2000 - are from individuals.\n\nBlackstone presents the most illustrative example of the cat-and-mouse game of culpability and authority when it comes to political spending.\n\nThe private equity giant is run by billionaire CEO Steve Schwarzman, who gave $35 million to SLF, $2.5 million to CLF, and $3 million to the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action. He also gave $325,600 to the Republicans who objected to the electoral results.\n\nRight after the election, Schwarzman - a Trump confidant - reportedly told business leaders that Trump had a right to challenge the results and \"took issue with suggestions made during the meeting that the U.S. could be on the verge of a coup,\" according to the Financial Times .\n\nSchwarzman publicly acknowledged Biden's victory a few weeks later, and last week he decried the violence at the Capitol - but he has not pledged to stop funding any Republican groups.\n\n\"We have been advised by counsel that we cannot direct political giving by individuals,\" a Blackstone spokesman told the Washington Post .\n\nBlackstone's own filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission suggest that the company evaluates all donations from executives.\n\n\"Personal political contributions or other political activity could be restricted by law or agreement or could have seriously negative business ramifications,\" Blackstone's policy reads . \"Therefore, all [Blackstone Group] employees and senior advisors (and members of immediate family) must obtain prior approval ... to make any political contributions or to solicit or coordinate any political contributions, including contributions to political parties or political action committees.... The employee will receive a reply from [Blackstone's] chief legal officer or his designee granting or denying clearance.\"\n\nA company spokesman told the Daily Poster : \"Our code of ethics simply helps ensure our employees adhere to their legal and compliance obligations; it does not relate in any way to directing employee giving on a partisan or ideological basis, and implying so is a total distortion.\"\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Daily Poster , here .\n\nDavid Sirota is editor-at-large at Jacobin .

He hasn't.\n\nRepublicans are cutting off unemployment benefits at a time when huge numbers of workers still desperately need them - and the Democrats aren't putting up a fight over it.\n\nRepublicans are taking advantage of the White House's refusal to invoke a law that would ensure stimulus money isn't used for tax cuts for the wealthy.\n\nDemocrats bankrolled by Big Pharma are suddenly targeting Nina Turner - right after she aired an ad touting Medicare for All.\n\nIn New York City, the Municipal Labor Committee is not only helping to block statewide single-payer health care, it's undermining retiree health care.

Yet we're somehow told that Medicare for All is too expensive.\n\nJoe Biden said on the campaign trail he would fight for a public option for health care. He hasn't - leaving health insurance companies, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies to work overtime to block states from passing their own public options.\n\nA newly obtained video shows an executive at UnitedHealth Group, the country's largest health insurer, opposing a proposed public option bill in Connecticut - and actually pushing employees to lobby against the bill.\n\nThere's no substitute for a national Medicare for All program. But with federal action shelved for now, states like Colorado and Washington are grappling with creating public health insurance alternatives in the face of industry opposition.\n\nUnions desperately need labor law reform through the PRO Act. But even if that bill remains off the table in the near future, Joe Biden can take immediate action through executive orders to roll back corporate union-busting like Amazon carried out in Bessemer, Alabama.\n\n{{ message }}"

But divided doesn't mean harmless - the hard right can still inflict pointless suffering on the millions of people who depend on government services.\n\nRepresentative Kevin McCarthy of California at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, October 3, 2023.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus proclaimed, \"Blessed are the peacemakers.\" That message has not yet reached the House Republican caucus. After less than a year of attempting to maintain a ceasefire among members of his party, Kevin McCarthy was ousted yesterday as Speaker of the House by a handful of Republicans. His downfall serves as a reminder of how deeply divided the GOP remains, and a warning of the high risks and low rewards that await those attempting to bridge that chasm.\n\nMcCarthy's tenure as speaker, the shortest in a century and a half, began with portents of its inglorious end. With only a single-digit majority coming out of the 2022 midterms, McCarthy was forced to hamstring his own speakership from the beginning. A number of far-right Republicans, led by deeply media-conscious figures like Colorado representative Lauren Boebert and Florida representative Matt Gaetz, insisted that McCarthy accept rules designed to weaken his position as speaker: most centrally, a provision allowing any House member, at any time, to call a vote to remove the speaker. After fifteen rounds of balloting that paralyzed the House for the better part of a week, McCarthy finally assented.\n\nFrom the beginning, then, McCarthy's speakership was defined by his futile attempts to mediate between the party's right-wing and ultraright-wing factions. In this, he followed in the footsteps of his predecessors. John Boehner, who led the Republicans in the House as speaker from 2011 to 2015, retired from the position amid persistent challenges to his leadership from the House Freedom Caucus, formed out of Tea Party congressmembers after the 2010 midterms. His successor, the Tea Party darling Paul Ryan, announced he was retiring after serving just two and a half years as speaker, during which time he was unable to rouse Donald Trump's interest in any part of his legislative agenda beyond tax cuts for the rich. Trump's followers, meanwhile, detested Ryan, and plotted his removal .\n\nMcCarthy seemed, for some reason, to believe he could succeed where Boehner and Ryan had failed and forge a Republican majority capable of delivering real legislative accomplishments. Given that he helmed the House in a moment of divided government, with Joe Biden in the White House and a Democratic Senate, the prospects for passing any Republican priorities were slim, so the Republican agenda became mainly about forcing budget austerity.\n\nEven in this, McCarthy was unable to achieve any substantive consensus in his caucus. The GOP was united in wanting to use the debt-ceiling negotiations last spring to force broader cuts to federal spending. However, there were deep disagreements about how deep the reductions should be, and what the party should risk to secure them. The Republicans were unable to achieve anything resembling a coherent negotiating position, and ended up winning cuts that were little more than cosmetic . About a third of Republicans voted against the final bill, and McCarthy relied on Democratic votes to pass it. McCarthy's decision both weakened his position toward Democrats in future negotiations and further inflamed the party right.\n\nIn the past month, the GOP's internal conflicts again prevented the House from approving the long-term spending bills that generally fund the federal government. When this happens, short-term funding bills, called continuing resolutions, generally fill the gap. However, the ultraright in the GOP, led by Gaetz, denounced the attempt to pass continuing resolutions , effectively embracing government shutdowns until the House GOP was able to come to some agreement on the long-term budgets. McCarthy, determined to avert a government shutdown, caved and offered the Democrats a continuing resolution that did not include military aid to Ukraine, but contained no other budget cuts. The climbdown was, by any estimation, a major defeat for the entire GOP, whose inability to come to a consensus handed the Democrats an even bigger win than the spring spending bill.\n\nMcCarthy's rejection of a shutdown prompted Gaetz to call for a vote on McCarthy's speakership, finally bringing down the sword he and the other ultraconservatives had held over the speaker's head for his entire tenure. By voting against McCarthy, they have triggered a new leadership contest among the Republicans.\n\nThe outcome of that contest is not at all clear. Several names have already surfaced as contenders. But whoever wins, their task is unenviable. The Republican majority is so thin that a handful of defectors can easily derail a bill. Effectively, if Gaetz and company are willing to endure a government shutdown and its potential electoral consequences, they can force the rest of the conference to go through with it as well. The only way those opposed to a shutdown could avoid it would be with Democratic votes - bought with compromises that would only bring more tantrums from the ultraconservatives.\n\nThe political talent on offer from the GOP bench hardly seems sufficient to thread this needle.\n\nThe Republican Party of 2023 is deeply divided, and this division has blocked it from achieving its political goals. But the party is still dangerous. It is entirely possible that Gaetz and his ilk will get their way under the next speaker, and the possibility of a protracted government shutdown can hardly be discounted. Already, markets are pricing in this likelihood . Such a shutdown would bring a vast amount of suffering to the millions of people who depend on government services, as well as government workers who would suddenly be without paychecks.\n\nNothing encapsulates the modern Republican Party better than this moment. With no coherent policy agenda, the GOP's only impact is to spread pointless suffering.\n\nYet amid the Sturm und Drang , one potentially unifying figure has been floated as a possibility for House speaker: Donald J. Trump. Since the speaker does not have to be an elected member of the House of Representatives, the suggestion is not merely idle chatter, and is doubtless being discussed by at least some members. It's a fitting image for where Trump himself has delivered the Republican Party - fractured, weakened, and with little beyond his own person to give it direction.\n\nPaul Heideman holds a PhD in American studies from Rutgers University-Newark.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nA \"philanthropic venture fund\" backed by elites is trying to remake Colorado's electoral system to make it easier for the wealthy to buy up elections.\n\nFormer DaVita CEO Kent Thiry. (R. J. Sangosti / the Denver Post via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIt is intimidatingly early on a Friday morning and I'm inside the bright-white Denver headquarters of Unite America, a \"philanthropic venture fund\" dedicated to radically reshaping the way we elect our public officials. The walls are splashed with slogans in red and blue reading things like \"Country Over Party.\" Depictions of the Statue of Liberty are omnipresent. A bubbly employee repeatedly offers me a bagel.\n\nNick Troiano, Unite America's executive director, walks in looking abundantly boyish in khakis and a neat haircut. At thirty-four, Troiano fronts an organization that has spent more than $70 million since 2019 pushing through electoral reforms. Unite America's core demands are open primaries, meaning one nonpartisan primary open to all candidates, and ranked-choice voting, where voters rank all eligible candidates in order of preference.\n\nWhen these reforms are passed, Unite America contends, they boost moderate candidates that appeal to an \"exhausted majority\" of centrist voters alienated by current modes for extremism within the Democratic and the Republican parties. While the reforms may sound anodyne, Unite America is not humble in its aims: to Troiano, this is about nothing less than the salvation of our nation.\n\nAmerica has a \"partisan polarization problem\" that has become a \"threat to our democracy itself,\" Troiano says. \"Our trust in institutions, our ability to hold free and fair elections, the rule of law\" - all are under threat. In order to protect those hallowed values, Unite America is \"engaged on the proverbial field of battle\" fighting \"the status quo that the political establishment want to protect in service of their own power.\" This work is \"existential in nature.\"\n\nBut critics fear that reforms like the ones pushed by Unite America are, in actuality, a path to possible plutocracy. Opponents say that under the guise of saving democracy, Unite America wants to mute the power of political parties altogether, and what that may leave is a playing field ostensibly open to all but in reality quickly dominated by the ultrarich. Lee Drutman, senior fellow at the left-of-center think tank New America, has argued that under open primaries , parties \"become brands anybody can purchase for enough money.\"\n\nOne of Unite America's most prominent boosters is the cochair of its board: Kent Thiry, a Three Musketeers obsessive and the former CEO of DaVita, the Denver-based dialysis giant that has paid out nearly $1 billion in settlements since 2012 in lawsuits alleging everything from Medicare fraud to wrongful deaths.\n\nThiry and Unite America's current pressing concern is their joint homebase, Colorado, where they are pushing a constitutional measure for the November ballot that would bring open primaries and ranked-choice voting to elections statewide beginning in 2026, from the state legislature and governor to the US Senate.\n\nThiry is part of a network of tycoons pushing open primaries and ranked-choice voting nationally. Collectively, they've spent millions boosting Unite America and pushing lookalike ballot measures in Massachusetts, Oregon, New York, Maine, Alaska, Nevada , and now Colorado. Thiry says his goal is to take this billionaire-backed election reform push and turn it into \"a true movement\" like \"civil rights, like gay marriage, like #MeToo.\"\n\nStates have wide leeway to run their elections however they want . For a group like Unite America and its wealthy backers, then, spending millions to push election reform ballot measures state by state is a gradual but enormously impactful way to tilt the axis of the country's political system. If Thiry gets his way in Colorado, his strategy could well become a blueprint for wealthy power brokers nationwide.\n\nEllen Dumm is a Colorado communications consultant who specializes in election reform. She's also part of a local crew that has sprung up to resist Thiry's measure. A \"cabal of election nerds,\" Dumm jokes. The group is gravely alarmed by the potential impacts of Thiry's reforms - above all, the possibility that Thiry is setting the stage to make it easier for himself to run for governor in 2026.\n\nOn March 6, Colorado's Title Board, a no-partisan three-person panel with jurisdiction over ballot measures, will hold a hearing to evaluate Thiry's proposed reform. The cabal and its lawyers will be there, hoping to stop the measure before it ever makes it to the ballot.\n\n\"The changes, taken together, would make it easier for powerful, wealthy people to control elections,\" Dumm says. \"And Unite America, obviously, has boatloads and boatloads of money.\"\n\nBorn and raised in Milford, Pennsylvania, Troiano says he's always had an \"affinity towards civic engagement,\" to \"leaving a community better than how you found it.\" Smiling, he adds, \"I joined student council in second grade and it's been a snowball rolling downhill ever since.\"\n\nIn 2014, then fresh out of Georgetown, he switched his affiliation from Republican to Independent to run for a Pennsylvania House of Representatives seat, managing an admirable 13 percent of the vote at twenty-four years old .\n\nSoon after, he joined the Centrist Project, a group founded by Dartmouth professor Charlie Wheelan that originally focused on helping elect self-described \"moderate\" candidates. In 2018, the Centrist Project rebranded as Unite America and then began shifting to a more ambitious goal: reforming electoral systems nationwide.\n\nAs Unite America's executive director, Troiano tells me, \"I have the fortune of being in a position to do something good for the country as a whole. That's not just an opportunity, but a responsibility.\"\n\nIn February, Troiano published a book, The Primary Solution , which promises to save \"our democracy from the fringes.\" It featured promotional blurbs from Michael Bloomberg, Andrew Yang, and Arnold Schwarzenegger (\"This book offers thought-provoking ideas to terminate polarization and extremism in America\"). In the book, Troiano writes that \"abolishing partisan primaries\" is \"the single most important thing we can do\" to hold the government \"accountable to delivering better results.\"\n\nTroiano generally avoids specifying what those actual desired results are. He shares that he's worried about the national debt and that his parents voted for Obama in 2008 and Trump in 2016. Mostly, though, his sales pitch is full of vague paeans to unity and reconciliation. It is well-honed, emotional, and undeniably effective.\n\n\"The largest and fastest-growing segment in the electorate are people who don't belong to either political party,\" he tells me. \"You wouldn't necessarily know that by the constant maps of red and blue - but this is a country of purple.\"\n\nTroiano cites proprietary Unite America research that shows a disproportionate number of independents who don't participate in partisan primaries are young people and military veterans.\n\n\"It's stunning that we're telling the people who fought for our country and who are the future of our country, 'You don't get to have a voice in who our leaders are,'\" he says. \"It's wrong, on its face.\"\n\nIn 2020, Alaska adopted open primaries and ranked-choice voting. In the first cycle of elections after the reforms, former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin lost a race for a House seat to a Democrat, and Republican Lisa Murkowski defeated a more right-wing challenger to hold on to her Senate seat.\n\nIn the wake of those results, the system was widely praised for boosting moderates just as its backers had promised. (Some pundits also pointed out that those results were most likely under a traditional electoral system, too.)\n\nIn November 2024, Troiano points out, \"half a dozen states might take\" Alaska-style initiatives \"to the ballot to reform primaries.\" In Arizona, Montana, South Dakota, and Idaho, measures are moving forward through the process of getting on the ballot. In Nevada, an Alaska-style measure is already on the ballot.\n\nThe Nevada measure's backers have spent more than $20 million pushing it forward. Those backers include Kent Thiry's Unite America cochair, Kathryn Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch's daughter-in-law; Kenneth Griffin, the hedge-fund billionaire and GOP megadonor; Katherine Gehl, a scion of the food manufacturing giant Gehl Foods; and Action Now, a group founded by another activist hedge-fund billionaire, John Arnold. Gehl, Murdoch, and Arnold's Action Now also donate directly to Unite America.\n\nUnite America spent over $3 million backing Alaska's reform, the original impetus for this current swell of reforms. Within a decade, Unite America hopes to get a majority of the states to follow Alaska. Troiano says that will \"enfranchise or empower millions of more voters\" and will \"liberate dozens of US representatives and senators to govern to do what we hire them to do - work with each other to solve the major problems that the voters care about.\"\n\nEllen Dumm's \"cabal of election nerds\" represent a spectrum of political voices - from mainstream Democrats to activist lawyers - that collectively believe Alaska-style reforms in Colorado will have one impact that Unite America doesn't ever mention: wealthy candidates will gain massive advantages.\n\nIf all of Thiry's proposed reforms are approved, the only way candidates in Colorado could get on ballots would be by collecting signatures. While that sounds democratic, in practice it means paying signature collectors who go out into the field and solicit signatures directly from residents throughout the state, and that's hugely expensive. Getting as few as eight thousand signatures can cost as much as $120,000 .\n\nMany of Dumm's allies in the cabal first met while pushing a suite of reforms in 2013 aimed at making voting in Colorado as accessible as possible. A little over a decade later, they reconnected to push back against Thiry. The group jokes that it's kind of like getting the band back together.\n\nShad Murib is one of Dumm's allies in the push against Thiry's ballot measure. He was born and raised outside of Denver to parents who emigrated from Lebanon; he owns a ranch where he raises Scottish Highland cattle for beef. He's also the head of Colorado's Democratic Party. Speaking of Colorado's current election systems, he swells with pride.\n\n\"Every hurdle you could put in front of somebody to make it harder for them to vote - we've removed those,\" he says.\n\nOf the system that Thiry is proposing, Murib says, \"Well-funded special interests are gonna love this system. Political consultants are gonna love this system. People are gonna make a lot of money off of the gamification of our elections. The grifters in this business are so excited by this.\"\n\nMurib's fears of \"gamification\" are bolstered by the recent history of manipulation of ranked-choice voting and open primaries - also known, due to their chaotic nature, as jungle primaries - in California. In the current race for a Senate seat, Democratic representative Adam Schiff is spending money to boost the name recognition of a weak Republican opponent in hopes that the underdog beats out Schiff's closest in-party competitor, and provides Schiff an easier road to victory. As University of California San Diego professor Thad Kousser has written , \"Welcome to the jungle primary, where races can become more about strategic fights and less about battles of ideas.\"\n\nThe Colorado Title Board evaluates whether a proposed ballot measure is limited to a \"single subject,\" meaning its focus is limited to one single reform. To navigate the Title Board's careful vetting, Thiry has hired a gaggle of attorneys from a massive corporate law firm, Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, who are currently pushing application after application through the Title Board.\n\nScott Wasserman is the president of the Bell Policy Center, which focuses on economic mobility issues in Colorado, and a longtime critic of Thiry's political actions.\n\n\"You can flood the ballot process and eventually get your title,\" Wasserman says, \"if you have $5 million and a dream.\"\n\nAlong with Brownstein, Thiry is also using a consulting firm, the 76 Group, which is run by Josh Penry, a former Republican member of the Colorado State Senate, to help push through his measure. Penry is widely seen as Thiry's well-compensated right-hand man in his quest to reform Colorado politics. In 2020, Penry bragged to KFF Health News that Thiry is \"the 800-pound gorilla of the ballot initiative process in Colorado.\" The former CEO, Penry added, \"wields more power in an informal way than virtually all the elected officials.\"\n\nGetting through the Title Board is a mundane and technical process with huge ramifications: once measures pass the Title Board, a wealthy backer like Thiry can spend the millions needed to pay the collectors to amass the 124,000 signatures needed to get on the ballot . Once the measure is on the ballot, Thiry can again spend freely, running ads that promote the measure to the voters in order to get over the 55 percent threshold to pass the measure into law.\n\nAt the March 6 Title Board hearing, Dumm and the cabal of election nerds will be represented by the self-described \" progressive law firm ,\" Tierney Lawrence Stiles. (The same law firm was involved with the failed legal challenge to keep Donald Trump off Colorado's presidential ballot .) They're hoping to convince the board that Thiry's measure would reform Colorado election law far beyond its stated aims and that it should not be approved as a single ballot measure.\n\nDumm has actually worked directly with Thiry before, during a 2018 redistricting process. When I ask what he's like in person, she says she never wanted to \"crawl inside that brain.\"\n\nA few days later, she emails me a follow-up response: \"To steal a line from Humphrey Bogart, he's just like every other man, but more so.\"\n\nBefore Thiry took on Colorado politics, he ran a big business for people's dying kidneys. DaVita and its competitor Fresenius make up the duopoly that controls dialysis, a treatment for severe kidney disease, throughout the United States. As our population ages, and as chronic kidney diseases become more prevalent, the global dialysis market is forecasted only to rise and rise . In order to boost its bottom line, DaVita has earned a reputation for providing medical care so shoddy that it regularly endangers patients' lives.\n\nKent Thiry announced he was moving DaVita from California to Colorado in 2009 after the company was promised more than $6 million in economic incentives both from the state of Colorado and the city of Denver. DaVita's world headquarters - allegedly known as \" Casa del Mundo \" by its employees - now dominate Denver's skyline.\n\n(When I asked a spokesperson for Colorado governor Jared Polis what benefits the state of Colorado saw in return for the incentives given to DaVita, they responded only to say that \"no state tax credits have been provided to DaVita since Governor Polis took office,\" in 2019.)\n\nSince the relocation to Colorado, and all while under Thiry's control, DaVita has strung together a long list of massive legal settlements.\n\nIn 2014, via the Department of Justice : \"DaVita paid $350m to resolve allegations . . . it gave illegal kickbacks to physicians who referred patients to DaVita\" including \"non-disparagement agreements that would have prevented the physicians from referring their patients to other dialysis providers.\"\n\nIn 2015, via the Department of Justice : DaVita \"has agreed to pay $450 million [for] creating unnecessary waste in administering the drugs Zemplar and Venofer to dialysis patients, and then billing the federal government for such avoidable waste.\"\n\nIn 2018, via Reuters : \"A federal jury in Colorado has awarded $383.5 million to the families of three patients who said they suffered cardiac arrests and died soon after receiving dialysis treatments at clinics run by DaVita Inc.\"\n\nIn How to Make a Killing: Blood, Death and Dollars in American Medicine , an exposé of DaVita and the larger dialysis industry, the investigative reporter Tom Mueller writes that the settlements are an integral part of DaVita's business model: \"All manner of flagrant misconduct, including serious criminal charges, is routinely resolved by the payment of a legal settlement, which often represents a fraction of the money that the firm made during the period of the alleged fraud.\"\n\nIn the same year as DaVita's settlement in the wrongful death lawsuit, a ballot measure in California, Proposition 8, aimed to improve care for dialysis patients and conditions for dialysis workers by capping dialysis companies' revenues at 115 percent of costs to deliver care, with earnings over that amount being rebated back to patients.\n\nProp 8 was promoted by Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the union that represents health care workers in California. In How to Make a Killing , Mueller writes that during the fight over Prop 8, Thiry internally \"reviled labor unions as un-American\" and \"affirmed his firm's right to dictate all aspects of dialysis care.\" Thiry and his allies spent $110 million to kill Prop 8, and in the process set a national record for spending on ballot measures.\n\nIn 2021, Thiry himself was indicted by the Department of Justice on charges that he colluded with other health care companies not to solicit each other's employees in order to quash the workers' earnings and opportunities. In 2022, he was acquitted of all charges and duly continued his pattern of shrugging off his company's legal troubles.\n\nA blandly handsome native Wisconsinite, Thiry cultivates a milquetoast outward persona. His Twitter/X bio partially reads \"Love being a father of two.\" When speaking to the press, Thiry sticks to mild Unite America-style talking points. He declined my repeated requests for an interview, instead sharing a statement: \"Elections belong to voters - not political parties. I strongly support efforts to bring truly open primaries to Colorado because voters have a right to choose any candidate in any election and they have grown weary of insiders gaming the system.\"\n\nThat milquetoast persona is belied by Thiry's personal idiosyncrasies. As the Denver Post reported in 2009, Thiry began rallying his workforce by utilizing the slogans and imagery of the classic 1844 Alexandre Dumas novel The Three Musketeers after watching the 1998 Leonardo DiCaprio musketeer movie The Man in the Iron Mask .\n\n\"I looked over, and tears were rolling down his face,\" a coworker and friend, Doug Vlchek, recalled to the Post . \"That's the guy who is passionate about what he is doing, whether it's making a difference at work or watching a movie.\"\n\nThiry has happily posed for press photos at the DaVita office in front of a mural depicting big old hats with feathers and swordsmen and other signifiers of musketeer culture. In Denver, Thiry is known for hosting parties at his large and lovely home in the city's affluent Cherry Hills neighborhood. Once, midparty, he promised a large donation to the charity of choice to whoever stayed cutting it up on the dance floor the longest. One partygoer told me he's spotted a mannequin wearing a Three Musketeers outfit on display in a room in the house. Another recalls Thiry standing up in front of a party crowd and reciting, from memory, the Gettysburg Address.\n\nIn 2017, Last Week Tonight With John Oliver devoted an entire episode to breaking down DaVita's exploitative business practices and personal quirks - and utilized, to great effect, footage from internal DaVita conferences in which Thiry does barefoot tumble rolls to Bob Seger while dressed like an old-timey swordsman.\n\nWhen the John Oliver segment aired, Thiry was exploring a run for Colorado governor. Within months, he announced he would not enter the race. (While considering running, Thiry switched his party affiliation to Republican from unaffiliated; after giving up the idea, he switched back.) The language he used alarmed many in the cabal of election nerds that, ever since, he's only been waiting for a more opportune time to try again.\n\nHe told reporters , \"I have held onto the dream of running for office since I was 10 years old.\"\n\nI meet Wendy Howell, the state director for the Colorado chapter of the Working Families Party, in the conference room of a beguilingly brutalist office building across from the State Capitol. A cheery and pugnacious speaker, Howell represents the left flank of the cabal.\n\n\"Given that our North Star is building governing power for the multiracial working class, we tend to look at any kind of shift in the rules around elections with a pretty hard eye,\" Howell says.\n\nHowell points out that, in the era of MAGA Republicans, a \"corporate Republican\" like Thiry would have a very tough time making it through a Republican primary. Under an open primary system, though, Thiry would have a much better chance of outspending the competition and forcing his way forward. Echoing a sentiment I'd hear again and again in Denver, Howell suggests Thiry is ultimately shifting the landscape to favor his own political aspirations: \"This is a billionaire who is trying to game the system so he can run for governor in 2026.\"\n\nHowell takes a well-timed comedic pause, then locks back into her flow: \"And I'm sorry but Kent Thiry is a ridiculous human being . This is a man who literally rode into his employee meetings on a horse in a Three Musketeers costume. If he were anyone but a billionaire, he would be the weirdest neighbor you have. He has no business having as much access to power as he does.\"\n\nColorado's elections have a reputation for high voter turnout, transparency, and security. The 2013 reforms shepherded by members of the cabal have only improved that reputation. A 2016 Pew poll of Colorado voters showed more than 90 percent approval in the system. Pew also found that the cost of the government processing a single vote had dropped from $16 to less than $10 after the reforms.\n\nUnderpinning Colorado's electoral system's \"gold standard\" reputation are its well-respected county clerks . They're the ones who actually count the votes. And they don't usually like to make a fuss. But soon after Unite America and Thiry began pushing their election reform measure, Colorado's clerks began speaking up. After attending one Title Board hearing on Thiry's measure, Chaffee County clerk Lori Mitchell told local media , \"This would throw a grenade right in the middle of our election model.\"\n\nMitchell's friend Carly Koppes is the clerk of Weld County, just north of Denver.\n\n\"We weren't spoken to at all,\" Koppes says to me. \"And we are the ones that run elections. If you're going to completely rework the entire election model, you should have conversations with the people that do the work.\"\n\nKoppes says she's most concerned about voter confusion leading to a loss of faith in the system.\n\n\"What we've been dealing with since 2016, and it increased after 2020, is voter mistrust,\" she said. \"And when you ask people about ranked-choice voting, they are very confused.\"\n\nThiry also has local critics on the far right, including Republican Colorado representative Lauren Boebert, who's called his proposed reforms a \"scheme launched by well-moneyed interests.\" According to Rolling Stone , nationally, ranked-choice voting has been opposed by archconservative activist Leonard Leo's Honest Elections Project.\n\nUnite America's stated aim is to root out \"radicals\" from both parties. In his book, Troiano takes aim at both \"MTG\" - Republican Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Green - and \"AOC\" - Democratic New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, implying they're equally nefarious forces in American politics. As the cabal interprets it, one of Thiry's end goals is to boost more corporate-friendly candidates, whether they're Republicans or Democrats.\n\nDumm says the cabal is not opposed to changes to Colorado's election system. In fact, Dumm points out, \"every year we learn something, every cycle the voting population changes, and every year, we go to the legislature with cleanup bills to stay as close as we can to the cutting edge of the best in the nation.\"\n\nBut if Thiry were able to cement Alaska-style reform in Colorado's constitution, Dumm says, \"we couldn't do that. It's a bullying tactic: 'It's mine, I'm going to put it here, nobody can change it.'\"\n\nUnite America sells its reforms as being good for generating more \"moderate\" candidates and less \"radical\" ones. But as Unite America's critics point out, the definitions of \"moderate\" and \"radical\" are in the eye of the beholder. To Scott Wasserman, of the Bell Policy Center, a \"moderate\" candidate who is against raising taxes on the rich would actually be quite \"radical\" to millions.\n\nUnder the widespread utilization of open primaries, the efficacy of political parties may wane. In Colorado, that may mean that a candidate like Thiry could run for higher office without ever really needing to say anything about what he believes in.\n\n\"Will voters ever hear Kent Thiry's views on taxes?\" Wasserman asks.\n\nIn his current iteration as an electoral reformer, Wasserman points out, Thiry \"fashions himself as [someone] who cares about democracy and civic society. Okay, cool. Then we should have a commitment from you that you are not gonna run for governor under this.

Lauren Boebert quickly became one of Congress' most controversial members. Six months into her first term, The Washington Post's Dana Milbank wrote a column describing the far-right Colorado Republican as being \"lost in a cacophony of crazy.\"\n\nIn the years that followed, Boebert's reputation managed to get worse, culminating in an incident last year when the Colorado Republican attended a family-friendly \"Beetlejuice\" musical production in Denver, only to get kicked out of the venue for \" causing a disturbance \" at the show. The lawmaker denied any wrongdoing, right up until surveillance footage from within the theater proved that she had obviously acted inappropriately .\n\nA year later, Boebert managed to switch congressional districts and win another term, at which point she managed to fall into yet another mess of her own making. The Hill reported :\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) briefly offered videos on Cameo, a website on which public figures sell personalized videos to fans, before the page went offline amid questions about whether it would have violated House ethics rules. An introductory video from Boebert was visible on Cameo as of Monday morning, and a screenshot posted by a Semafor reporter showed her charging $250 per video.\n\n\"Hey, Cameo, it's your girl from Colorado, Lauren Boebert. I am so excited to be joining another platform where I can connect directly with supporters from all over the world,\" she said in the video. \"Whether you or someone you know needs an America First pep talk, if you want to surprise friends or family with a message for a special day, or if you just want to know my thoughts on whatever's on your mind, Cameo is the place to connect with me. You can book a video now on my Cameo profile, and I will be seeing you and talking with you soon.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Cameo confirmed to The Denver Post not only that Boebert's account was authentic, but also that she was the first sitting federal lawmaker to use the platform.\n\nA Cameo spokesperson confirmed the authenticity of the Boebert account to The Denver Post , noting that she was the first sitting member of Congress to join the platform.\n\nBut it's not because the other 534 members on Capitol Hill are shy. The New Republic explained that Boebert's Cameo account appeared to violate House rules.\n\nFirst, there's an outside income limit of $31,815, so she'd have to watch how much money she makes, and second, under House rules, members are prohibited from receiving honoraria, defined as a \"payment of money or thing of value for an appearance, speech, or article.\" Now, if Boebert was having her Cameo proceeds go to her campaign account, that would probably be in line with House rules, but that is prohibited by the video platform.\n\nOr put another way, the existence of Boebert's Cameo account was likely to result in a House Ethics Committee investigation, which probably helps explain why the account disappeared after one day.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Ken Buck of Colorado announced he will leave Congress earlier than expected - at the end of next week. His early exit makes the already-narrow Republican majority in the House even narrower . But what other implications might it have? And what does it have to do with his conservative Colorado peer Lauren Boebert ? Mark Murray , NBC News' senior political editor, is here to help.\n\nRep. Boebert narrowly won re-election in 2022. But how are her chances looking in 2024?\n\nIn 2022, Boebert barely beat Democrat Adam Frisch in CO-3, a Republican-leaning congressional district - but not necessarily a ruby-red one. Frisch decided to run against Boebert again, creating a supercompetitive House race for this November. That was until Boebert opted to run instead in Buck's soon-to-be available district, CO-4 - a much more Republican-friendly seat. So, Boebert maneuvered herself out of a rematch with Frisch.\n\nBuck's decision was abrupt and unexpected - especially for Boebert. Why is that?\n\nBuck's decision this week to resign - instead of serving out his term through 2024 - triggers a special election in June. This in turn forced Boebert to make a series of tough decisions. Would she run for CO-4 in the special election, earning a leg up as the incumbent there, but also requiring her to resign her current CO-3 seat (and thus reducing the GOP's House majority even further)? Would she avoid the special election, allowing another Republican to snag incumbent status and possibly putting herself at an electoral disadvantage when she runs for the seat in November?\n\nSo what path did Boebert ultimately choose?\n\nUltimately, Boebert chose the second option: She won't run in the special election and thus won't have to give up her CO-3 seat. But that means that in November, she may have to run against whichever Republican wins the June CO-4 special election, assuming that special election winner isn't simply a caretaker. Bottom line: Boebert's decision saves House Republicans from having to deal with yet another congressional vacancy right now, with their majority already hanging by a thread. But it could make her return path to Congress more difficult.\n\nThis week, Vice President Kamala Harris became the first vice president (or president) to ever visit an abortion clinic when she visited a Planned Parenthood in St. Paul, Minnesota - a state that has become a safe haven for abortion rights. Research published in 2023 showed average monthly abortions increased in Minnesota in the 12 months after Roe was overturned, as neighboring states (North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Wisconsin) rolled back access.\n\nHarris' historic visit is a stark contrast to the approach Democrats have taken for many years, and reflects the changing political climate.\n\nGiven the energizing power of abortion in the 2022 midterms, as well as in a number of special elections, it's not surprising that the Biden-Harris campaign has embraced the issue. The campaign is running ads highlighting powerful testimonials from women whose lives have been upended due to strict abortion bans in their states, and drawing attention to Donald Trump's role in overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"Right now in our country, we are facing a very serious health crisis,\" Harris said after her Planned Parenthood visit. \"It is only right and fair that people have access to the health care they need, and that they have access to health care in an environment where they are treated with dignity and respect.\"\n\nAbortion rights is sure to be a central issue in the 2024 election, and keeping it front and center is a smart strategy for Democrats. I'll be watching to see how else the Biden campaign reminds voters that one candidate is fighting for their rights while the other is still working to take them away.\n\nThis week marks a big anniversary at MSNBC - it's officially been one year of \"Inside with Jen Psaki\" !

Ken Buck 's term - and could pose a challenge to Rep. Lauren Boebert's bid for another term in Congress.\n\nIt's an unusual and confusing twist in a closely watched primary race for a district the far-right Republican Boebert has not represented previously . Whoever the committee chooses is expected to prevail in the special election against the Democratic nominee, finish Buck's term and reinforce Republicans' slim majority in the U.S. House.\n\nBut the decision could have farther-reaching consequences. The committee is expected to pick one of the current Republican primary candidates competing for the same seat. Boebert opted to finish her current term in her old district, and the committee will likely select one of her rivals.\n\nWhoever is picked would be running in two separate races for the same seat until the June election, giving them greater notoriety, media coverage and expanded fundraising opportunities - a boon for most of the candidates who fall far short of Boebert's national name brand and campaign chest.\n\n\"Ken Buck really threw a wrench into the whole thing,\" said Seth Masket, director at the Center on American Politics in Denver, who noted that it's unclear what Buck's intentions are. \"It was already a fairly topsy-turvy race, but I think this does make it a little bit harder for her.\"\n\nBoebert said in a recent statement that the move was interference: \"The establishment concocted a swampy backroom deal to try to rig an election.\"\n\nThe congresswoman has built a far-right name with a ferocious political style, in step with the accusation of election rigging, and remains a known, if divisive, quantity among conservatives nationwide.\n\nWhile Boebert has made headlines with scandals, including a tape of her groping and vaping with a date in a Denver theater, she's also garnered endorsements from former President Donald Trump and current Speaker of the House Mike Johnson.\n\nWhoever is picked would be running in two separate races for the same seat until the June election, giving them greater notoriety, media coverage and expanded fundraising opportunities - a boon for most of the candidates who fall far short of Boebert's national name brand and campaign chest.\n\n\"Ken Buck really threw a wrench into the whole thing,\" said Seth Masket, director at the Center on American Politics in Denver, who noted that it's unclear what Buck's intentions are. \"It was already a fairly topsy-turvy race, but I think this does make it a little bit harder for her.\"\n\nBoebert said in a recent statement that the move was interference: \"The establishment concocted a swampy backroom deal to try to rig an election.\"\n\nThe congresswoman has built a far-right name with a ferocious political style, in step with the accusation of election rigging, and remains a known, if divisive, quantity among conservatives nationwide.\n\nShe defended the move by saying her voice is still needed in Congress, and that her exodus from the old district makes it easier for Republicans to retain the seat, and therefore their majority in the U.S. House.\n\nThe option to district hop was opened to Boebert after Buck announced he wouldn't run for reelection last year, citing his party's handling of Trump.\n\nThen, earlier this month, Buck abruptly resigned, pointing to the \"bickering and nonsense\" he said now pervades the U.S. Capitol. Buck left Congress on March 22.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

      "text": "Rep. Jeff Hurd is a principled conservative who refuses to play culture war games\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nThis article is the sixth in a six-part MSNBC Daily series, \"Meet the Freshmen,\" featuring six of Congress' newest faces - three Republicans and three Democrats - in a series of diverse columns that explore the new members' backstories, policies, home districts and where they fit in this historic political moment. You can read the rest of the series here .\n\nCongress' new members have arrived in Washington with some positioning themselves to challenge the status quo . One incoming House freshman, Jeff Hurd, R-Colo., is entirely new to politics, having held no previous political office. Since he won his election, he has made no splashy statements or had any media controversies. By all appearances, he seems to be far more interested in legislating than in becoming a social media star. And that could be just what Washington needs.\n\nFor Colorado's 3rd District, Hurd will surely be a breath of fresh air. The district was most recently represented by embattled Rep. Lauren Boebert , before she moved districts to escape a tough re-election bid made only more difficult by her many public controversies. Hurd acknowledged that his representation of Colorado would be a \"different style\" from Boebert's. Specifically, Hurd's campaign said he would not engage in the same \"disgraceful behavior\" that made Boebert unable \"to deliver results for [the] district.\" This is a hopeful sign for Coloradans and Americans everywhere that our days of outlandish political theater are ending.\n\nSince he won his election, he has made no splashy statements or had any media controversies.\n\nHurd says he intends to focus on issues integral to his rural district and the whole of America, such as supporting small businesses and agriculture, protecting natural resources and increasing energy development. Importantly, Hurd tends to not lean in hard on culture war issues. He is against abortion, for example, but believes in exceptions for rape, incest and life-or-death situations. Calling himself a \"constitutionalist,\" he says he'd vote against a federal ban on abortion at 15 weeks - preferring to leave the matter to the states. Instead, he plans to focus on issues of fundamental importance to everyday Americans, saying he intends to \"be the principled, problem-solving Republican leader that Colorado needs.\"\n\nOn controversial issues such as immigration, Hurd notes his support for reforming our country's broken legal immigration system while highlighting the importance of securing our nation's borders.\n\nHurd presents a more nuanced conservative position on immigration reform than the brash plans supported by President-elect Donald Trump . While Hurd is in favor of allocating resources to recommence the construction of the border wall, he stresses that these efforts need to be focused on high-traffic areas - which is reminiscent of Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign promises and a sentiment also expressed by his Democratic challenger, Adam Frisch . Importantly, Hurd diverges from Trump when it comes to his views on mass deportations, as Hurd supports these efforts only when it comes to violent criminals who have entered the United States illegally.\n\nHurd is a native Coloradan living in his hometown, Grand Junction, with his wife, Barbora, and his five children. Barbora is originally from Czechoslovakia, where she grew up under \"the iron grip of communist rule\" and eventually saw the fall of the system before she immigrated to and became a citizen of the United States.\n\nHurd's lack of political background puts him in the perfect position to bring about institutional change to one of America's oldest institutions.\n\nHurd and his wife both had humble beginnings that he says led them to appreciate the fundamentals of the Constitution: limited government, individual rights and free markets. This appreciation for the Constitution turned into a career for Hurd, as he went on to study law at the University of Denver and Columbia Law School before he returned to Grand Junction to grow his family with Barbora and practice law. Hurd's intimate understanding of the downfalls of communism seems to have inspired his views on both legal immigration and the importance of safeguarding fundamental rights.\n\nHurd's wholesome social media presence - you won't find any ALL-CAPS rants from this Republican - is yet another positive indication that he will not feed into the toxic clout-chasing many of his congressional colleagues indulge in regularly.\n\nWhile it can be entertaining to watch the social media remixes of congressional members' harsh remarks to one another , these escapades slowly tarnish our country's reputation and international standing while normalizing the poor treatment of our peers. As Hurd put it on his campaign website, \"Congress has a lot of performers, but not enough doers.\" For many Americans, it is time for politicians to stop these silly games and act like the professionals they ought to be.\n\nHurd's lack of political background puts him in the perfect position to bring about institutional change to one of America's oldest institutions. The age of the culture war is waning, and outsiders like Hurd can lead America back to its roots of limited government, individual rights and - most importantly - respect.\n\nSofia Hamilton is a policy analyst at a Washington, D.C.-area policy organization and a harm reduction fellow with Young Voices.

Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., is hopping over to a neighboring congressional district next year to run for re-election to the House . Boebert announced Wednesday that she won't be running in her native 3rd Congressional District, which she's represented for two terms, and is instead leaping over to the 4th, where Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., is retiring. It's a sign of how much she's made a mess of things in her current district, and it underscores how serving as a MAGA firebrand has limited her versatility as a politician even in what should be friendly territory.\n\nOf course, that wasn't how Boebert explained her decision. \"It's the right move for me personally, and it's the right decision for those who support our conservative movement,\" she said in a video announcement Wednesday. She didn't get into how exactly it's the right thing for the 4th District, where she won't be moving until next year. But her calculation is straightforward: The 4th District is considerably more conservative than the 3rd, giving her higher chances of winning a race, assuming she prevails in the primary.\n\nBoebert has only herself to blame for the predicament.\n\nIn her announcement, Boebert argued that her hand had been forced. She claimed that \"Hollywood elites and progressive money groups\" were conspiring against her to \"buy\" the 3rd District. It's true that Democratic rival Adam Frisch has been pulling in record-breaking amounts of cash for an expected rematch against Boebert (although it's worth noting that he was also dwarfing her small-dollar donors). Frisch's strong performance against her last year was a surprise - it was a district that Donald Trump won by 6 points in 2020, and Trump had endorsed her. Boebert has chosen to duck out to avoid what might've been shaping up to be a fatal blow.\n\nAnd Boebert has only herself to blame for the predicament. In her brief time in office, she established herself as one of the most prominent and controversial politicians on Capitol Hill. She insisted on walking around Washington armed with a gun and made a show of refusing to be patted down after setting off metal detectors in the U.S. Capitol. She made bigoted jokes about a Muslim colleague's being a terrorist . She had awkward confrontations with advocates for mass shooting victims. She became buddies with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, whose conspiracy theories were as racist as they were ludicrous , only to then have a very public falling-out . While the 3rd District leans red , it's the most Democratic friendly of the state's GOP-held districts , and Boebert's appetite for hard-right and inflammatory activism quickly became politically risky.\n\nAfter that narrow re-election, Boebert also had a personal scandal this year that seemingly repelled even longtime supporters . She and her companion were kicked out of a performance of \"Beetlejuice\" in Denver in September after fellow theatergoers complained about inappropriate behavior . That incident may have been what Boebert was referring to when she noted that she had made \"personal mistakes\" in the past year in discussing her decision not to run again in her current district.\n\nThe combination of Boebert's controversies and Frisch's rise inspired prominent Republicans conservatives to turn on her. Former Gov. Bill Owens and former Sen. Hank Brown endorsed her relatively moderate Republican primary challenger, Jeff Hurd, as did the conservative-leaning editorial board of The Colorado Springs Gazette. \"Boebert has a seemingly intractable image problem, which has manifested in lackluster financial support,\" the board noted in its endorsement of Hurd. \"She appears divisive at a time when voters want peace.\"\n\nIt's a sign of how toxic Boebert had become that after she announced she wouldn't be running in the 3rd Congressional District, the Cook Political Report changed its assessment of the race from \"toss-up\" to \"lean Republican.\" Boebert's reputation had made a red district more purple than it would've otherwise been. But rather than rethink the way she does politics or consider more broadly how she might better serve her constituents, she's fleeing to another district where she hopes a more conservative electorate will shield her from the cost of her recklessness and attention-seeking activism. Whether that's good for the people of Colorado appears to be the least of her concerns.\n\nZeeshan Aleem is a writer and editor for MSNBC Daily.

Jamaal Bowman - a member of the progressive \"squad\" and a fierce Israel critic - facing scores of attacks.\n\nThe historic spending, according to the ad tracking firm AdImpact, includes $14.8 million in ads from United Democracy Project, a super PAC tied to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.\n\nPro-Israel groups are backing Bowman's opponent, Westchester County Executive George Latimer, a centrist who has served in local politics for decades and is an unabashed supporter of Israel.\n\nAnd while voters in the district said they are focused on other issues, like jobs and the environment, the unprecedented spending has made the primary a closely watched proxy fight in Democrats' broader intraparty battle that has played out over the Israel-Hamas war this election cycle.\n\nThe Bowman-Latimer brawl has attracted other prominent names, as well. Hillary Clinton, a Westchester County resident, endorsed Latimer , as did former Rep. Mondaire Jones, D-N.Y., a onetime Bowman ally and fellow Congressional Black Caucus member who has since blasted Bowman's criticism of Israel.\n\nJones, whose move infuriated progressives , is expected to win the Democratic nomination in a neighboring swing district for the chance to take on freshman GOP Rep. Mike Lawler in the fall. New York's primaries will also set the matchups in several competitive districts that will be key to the fight for the House.\n\nMeanwhile, Bowman brought in progressive reinforcements over the weekend. On Friday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., campaigned with Bowman in south Westchester County, and Sanders and neighboring Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., stumped with Bowman in the Bronx on Saturday.\n\n\"They are spending more money than has ever been spent in American history,\" Bowman said at the rally with Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez. \"But they are the money. We are the mighty. They are the money; we are the many. And they will not stop us. No matter what. We will not be stopped.\"\n\nIn addition to New York, Utah and Colorado will also hold primaries Tuesday, and South Carolina will hold primary runoffs.\n\nGOP Rep. Ken Buck's decision to resign in March has shaken up this year's Colorado's primaries. Voters in Buck's deep-red 4th District will also pick his replacement Tuesday in a special election.\n\nRepublican Greg Lopez, a former state director for the Small Business Administration and a former mayor of Parker, is favored to win the special election in the 4th District, given the district's Republican lean. Former President Donald Trump won by 19 points in 2020, according to calculations from Daily Kos Elections .\n\nLopez has run for office multiple times, including having unsuccessfully run for governor in 2022 and 2018. He is a staunch conservative and has taken some far-right positions , including not supporting any exceptions to a ban on abortions and casting doubt on the 2020 election results.\n\nLopez isn't running for a full term, so he would serve only about six months if he wins Tuesday. He is competing against Democrat Trisha Calvarese, a speechwriter.\n\nThere's also a primary Tuesday to pick nominees for this fall's general election in the 4th District. GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert decided to switch districts and run for the seat Buck is vacating, instead of seeking re-election in the 3rd District, which she barely won in 2022. Boebert, who has Trump's endorsement, is expected to secure the GOP nomination Tuesday.\n\nBoebert's move has also led to a crowded GOP primary in the more competitive 3rd District, which Trump won by 9 points in 2020. The race has been the target of some last-minute spending by the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House GOP leadership, against one of the Republican candidates.\n\nThe Congressional Leadership Fund launched a TV ad targeting former state Rep. Ron Hanks after Democrats appeared to be meddling in the primary to boost him, according to The Colorado Sun , possibly betting that he could be easier to beat in November. Hanks has denied the 2020 election results, and he marched to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He also ran unsuccessfully in the GOP Senate primary in 2022.\n\nDemocrat Adam Frisch, the former Aspen City Council member who nearly defeated Boebert, cleared the primary field on his side of the aisle. Frisch also appears to be putting his finger on the scale in the GOP primary by launching a TV ad targeting attorney Jeff Hurd, one of the top GOP candidates. The spot could damage Hurd's standing among conservative voters by suggesting that Hurd's positions on abortion and Trump are unclear; Hanks has been running as an unapologetic conservative on those issues.\n\nAnother House Republican exit has shaken up the GOP primary in the deep-red 5th District, where Rep. Doug Lamborn is retiring. Trump has endorsed state GOP Chairman Dave Williams, while House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and other congressional Republicans have endorsed Jeff Crank, a political consultant and former radio host.\n\nUtah Republicans are set to effectively choose who will replace retiring GOP Sen. Mitt Romney, one of the party's biggest Trump critics, next year.\n\nTrump is backing Riverton Mayor Trent Staggs, who also won the backing of Utah Republicans at their April convention . Despite Trump's endorsement, the race is hard-fought among four well-funded candidates. Former Utah House Speaker Brad Wilson has been the top fundraiser, thanks in part to his lending his campaign $3 million.\n\nBut Rep. John Curtis has been boosted by a flurry of outside ad spending, more than $6.6 million, by a group called Conservative Values for Utah and by another, a pro-cryptocurrency super PAC called Defend American Jobs that has been active in other GOP primary races across the country. The ads have largely been a mix of spots highlighting Curtis and others that criticize Staggs, who has been boosted by $700,000 in ad spending from Protect Freedom PAC, a group aligned with Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. Jason Walton, a businessman who lent his campaign $2.5 million, is also running.\n\nThe winner of the GOP primary will face Democrat Caroline Gleich in the fall and becomes the odds-on favorite to replace Romney in the red state.\n\nCurtis' decision to run for the Senate opened up a primary in the 3rd District. Utah County entrepreneur Case Lawrence and Roosevelt Mayor J.R. Bird are the top fundraisers in the race, which also includes state Sen. Mike Kennedy, state Auditor John Dougall and former state GOP chairman Stewart Peay.\n\nTrump picks are also running in two other House races - one in a Colorado swing seat and one in a Republican stronghold in South Carolina.\n\nTrump supports state Rep. Gabe Evans, who is running against former state Rep. Janak Joshi in Colorado's competitive 8th District, where Republicans are looking to dethrone freshman Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo. She won her first term in 2022 by just 1 percentage point.\n\nAnd in South Carolina's 3rd District runoff, Trump is behind pastor Mark Burns, who hopes to replace the retiring Rep. Jeff Duncan. Burns and nurse Sheri Biggs moved on to a runoff after the state's congressional primary this month when no candidate won a majority of the vote.\n\nI have covered Capitol Hill for the past 15 years and joined NBC News as a senior congressional reporter in 2022.

Lauren Boebert, turning to Twitter during the national address, was apparently unimpressed - because as far the Colorado Republican is concerned, it was Biden himself who closed schools.\n\nAs others have explained in detail , this was problematic for a couple of fairly obvious reasons. The first is that decisions related to school closures were made by state and local officials, not the White House.\n\nThe second is that school closures occurred in 2020 , when Biden was a private citizen with no official powers or responsibilities. The Democrat couldn't have closed schools even if he wanted to - which is the sort of basic detail that an elected federal lawmaker should probably understand.\n\nNaturally, this has generated a new round of derision for the far-right Coloradan, whose reputation was already dreadful. But what strikes me as surprising is the frequency with which incidents like these occur, even after last year's midterm elections.\n\nAs regular readers know , soon after taking office two years ago, Boebert became one of Congress' most controversial members. Six months into her first term, The Washington Post's Dana Milbank wrote a column describing the congresswoman as being \"lost in a cacophony of crazy.\"\n\nIt was generally assumed that she'd face no real consequences for her partisan antics. After all, Boebert represented a GOP-friendly district where her re-election was all but assured. Headed into the 2022 midterm elections, FiveThirtyEight's forecast model showed the right-wing incumbent with a 97% chance of winning, despite her routine ridiculousness. Both parties showed little interest in the race, assuming the results were a foregone conclusion.\n\nWhat the political world didn't fully appreciate was just how many voters in Colorado's 3rd district had grown tired of Boebert's strange behavior and bizarre ideas. The Republican incumbent prevailed, but her re-election contest proved to be one of the nation's closest House races .\n\nThe message from local voters seemed pretty obvious: Much of the \"red\"-leaning district was unimpressed with the congresswoman and her antics. Common sense suggested that Boebert should learn from the near-defeat and become a more respectable lawmaker, if for no other reason than to improve her career prospects.\n\nBy all appearances, Boebert has learned very little, and she seems to be just as outlandish in this Congress as she was in the last. The congresswoman is taking a real risk, even if she doesn't appear to care.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., won her GOP primary Tuesday, NBC News projects, after she decided to run in a different district from the one where she narrowly won re-election in 2022.\n\nBoebert defeated five other Republicans for the party's nomination in Colorado's 4th District, which opened up after Rep. Ken Buck announced this year that he would resign. She will be heavily favored to win the seat in the general election given the area's rightward lean.\n\nBoebert, who is in her second term, eked out a 546-vote victory in the neighboring 3rd District two years ago and faced the prospect of a rematch with Adam Frisch, a well-funded Democrat. Former President Donald Trump won the 4th District by 19 points, while he carried the 3rd District by 8 points in 2020, according to calculations from Daily Kos Elections .\n\nBoebert, whom Trump backed, built a national profile as a conservative firebrand after she pulled off a surprising 2020 GOP primary win against then-Rep. Scott Tipton, in part by promising to take on high-profile liberal figures like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\n\"Since the first day I ran for public office I promised I would do whatever it takes to stop the socialists and communists from taking over our country,\" Boebert said in December when she announced her decision to run in the 4th District. \"That means staying in the fight. But it also means not allowing Hollywood elites and progressive money groups to buy the 3rd District.\"\n\nBoebert also said the move would be a \"fresh start\" after a difficult year for her personally, noting she and her husband had divorced. She was granted a temporary restraining order against her ex-husband in February. She also grabbed headlines last year for being escorted out of a musical for allegedly \"vaping, singing [and] causing a disturbance.\"\n\nBoebert's decision to run in the neighboring 4th District also shook up the GOP primary in the more competitive 3rd District, where Frisch, a former member of the Aspen City Council, cleared the Democratic field and won the party's nomination.\n\nAttorney Jeff Hurd won the GOP primary to face Frisch in the fall, NBC News projects, overcoming a Democratic effort to meddle in the Republican contest and secure an opponent who could be easier to beat in November.\n\nA Democratic outside group launched a TV ad appearing to boost controversial former state Rep. Ron Hanks, according to The Colorado Sun . Hanks has denied the 2020 election results, and he marched to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He also ran unsuccessfully in the GOP Senate primary in 2022.\n\nThe Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House GOP leadership, countered the effort with its own TV ad targeting Hanks. Frisch also appeared to play in the primary by launching a TV ad aimed at Hurd, potentially damaging his standing among conservative voters by suggesting his positions on abortion and Trump are unclear.\n\nIn the deep-red 5th District, Republicans selected political consultant Jeff Cranks, a former radio host, to replace retiring GOP Rep. Doug Lamborn.\n\nCrank's victory is a blow to Trump, who had endorsed state GOP Chairman Dave Williams. Crank had support from House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and a few other congressional Republicans.\n\nBoebert also decided not to run in the special election to serve out the rest of Buck's term, opting to remain in Congress and continue representing the 3rd District.\n\nRepublican George Lopez won the special election Tuesday to replace Buck, NBC News projects, meaning Lopez will soon head to the House and help pad Republicans' thin majority. Lopez did not run for a full term, so he will serve in Congress for only about six months.\n\nLopez, a former state director for the Small Business Administration and a former mayor of Parker, has run for office multiple times, including having made unsuccessful bids for governor in 2022 and 2018.

He also does not support any exceptions to a ban on abortions.\n\nTuesday's primaries also set the matchup in Colorado's 8th District, which is expected to be one of the most competitive House races in the country this year.\n\nAs expected, state Rep. Gave Evans won the GOP primary to take on Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo, who won her first term in 2022 by just 1 percentage point.

The Associated Press called the race for her less than half an hour after polls closed as she led by a wide margin.\n\nAn outspoken right-wing lawmaker, Ms. Boebert first won her seat in 2020 after upsetting an incumbent Republican in a primary. She made a name for herself with strong pro-gun views, packing a Glock on her hip and encouraging staff at her now closed restaurant to openly carry handguns. In Congress, she has become known for her strident MAGA views and has become entangled in a series of personal scrapes, including being ejected from a Denver theater in a lascivious episode that was caught on closed-circuit camera.\n\nFacing a strong Democratic threat in the sprawling western Colorado district where she was first elected, Ms. Boebert chose to relocate to eastern Colorado to give herself a better chance of remaining in the House - and it appears to have worked.\n\nThe seat was vacated earlier this year by Ken Buck, a Republican who left Congress before the end of his term and will be replaced temporarily by Greg Lopez, a Republican former mayor of Parker who won a separate special election on Tuesday. Ms. Boebert did not run in the special election, since that would have required her giving up her current seat, cutting into the thin Republican majority.\n\nFormer President Donald J. Trump endorsed her, and her national profile helped her raise significantly more money than her five primary opponents, who split the anti-Boebert vote and enabled her victory despite claims that she was carpetbagging by suddenly changing her residence.\n\nMs. Boebert narrowly won re-election in her original district in 2022 by just over 500 votes and would have again faced a challenge from Adam Frisch, a Democrat who made the race close two years ago with little outside help. This go-round, he was drawing strong financial support from Democrats who saw a chance to oust Ms. Boebert.\n\nNow, with Ms. Boebert gone, Democrats are hoping to pick up the seat she now holds in the conservative district, which includes high-end ski resorts as well as energy facilities and working ranches. Democrats boosted a right-wing conservative in a crowded primary there, gambling that a far-right Republican might be easier for Mr. Frisch to defeat in November.\n\nBut the effort came up short when Jeff Hurd, a Grand Junction lawyer, won the Republican nomination on Tuesday, giving the party establishment the candidate it preferred against Mr. Frisch.\n\nCarl Hulse is the chief Washington correspondent, primarily writing about Congress and national political races and issues.

Some Republicans Want an Alternative.\n\nTrump Administration\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nThe \"Beetlejuice\" incident continues to haunt the once-unrepentant congresswoman from Colorado. The state's old guard is lining up behind a primary challenger.\n\nBy Charles Homans\n\nPhotographs by Rachel Woolf\n\nCharles Homans drove 640 miles across Colorado's 3rd congressional district, which is nearly three times the size of Switzerland, to report this story.\n\nAt a casino bingo hall in southwestern Colorado, Lauren Boebert, the Republican congresswoman, bounced her 6-month-old grandson on her knee.\n\n\"The election's still a ways away,\" she said, as the guests arriving for the Montezuma County Republican Party's annual Lincoln Day dinner trickled into the room. \"And in talking with people at events like this, you know, it seems like there's a lot of mercy and a lot of grace.\"\n\nThe month before, Ms. Boebert, then in the midst of finalizing a divorce, was caught on a security camera vaping and groping her date shortly before being ejected from a performance of the musical \"Beetlejuice\" at the Buell Theater in Denver for causing a disturbance. The footage contradicted her own initial claims about the incident, and the venue's statement that Ms. Boebert had demanded preferential treatment added to the outrage.\n\nThe episode has proved surprisingly sticky for Ms. Boebert, a politician who more than almost any other has embodied the gleefully provocative, no-apologies politics of the party's right wing in the Biden era. Several local Republican officials have since announced their endorsement of Jeff Hurd, a more conventional Republican challenging her for the nomination this year.\n\nMr. Hurd's candidacy has become a vessel for Republican discontent with the perceived excesses of the party's MAGA wing. His backers include old-guard party fixtures such as former Gov. Bill Owens and former Senator Hank Brown.

Beto O'Rourke performed better than expected in these majority-Hispanic counties. - Nate Cohn Nov. 9, 2022\n\nDemocrats and Republicans each need to win three more competitive Senate seats to win control of the chamber (in addition to the races they are expected to win most easily). Here's the state of the closest races: - Lazaro Gamio Nov. 9, 2022\n\nWith more counties nearly finished counting, things keep looking better for Lt. Gov. John Fetterman. He's outperforming Biden across the state and is currently up 8 points in counties that were the closest in 2020. - Alicia Parlapiano Nov. 9, 2022\n\nAlaska has competitive races for both the Senate and the House, neither of which is a straightforward Democrat-versus-Republican affair. Don't expect quick results in either race; officials in Alaska won't finish counting absentee ballots for about two weeks. - Maggie Astor Nov. 8, 2022\n\nGov. DeSantis outperformed Trump in Florida in every county that has nearly finished counting votes. While the three majority-Hispanic counties - Hendry, Miami-Dade and Osceola - shifted the most, Latino turnout tends to drop more in the midterms compared with other groups. - Alicia Parlapiano Nov. 8, 2022\n\nThe early vote in Arizona has been strong for Democrat Mark Kelly, but we expect a good portion of the in-person and late-counted mail vote to favor Blake Masters. It could be awhile before all votes are counted. - Alicia Parlapiano Nov. 8, 2022\n\nIn Washington State, Senator Patty Murray is facing a strong Republican challenge, though she remains favored to win. Aside from that, the main action at this hour will be in the House, with a close race in Washington's 8th District and at least half a dozen in California. - Maggie Astor Nov. 8, 2022\n\nIt's still early in Wisconsin, but it looks close. In the counties where most of the vote is in, Senator Ron Johnson is running ahead of Trump. - Nate Cohn Nov. 8, 2022\n\nKentucky, a solidly red state, reelected Rand Paul to the Senate. But so far, voters are rejecting an effort to deny abortion rights. However the state already bans abortions, and that is unlikely to change. - Lazaro Gamio Nov. 8, 2022\n\nIt's still early, but Fetterman is running ahead of Biden in five Pennsylvania counties that have reported nearly all of their votes. - Nate Cohn Nov. 8, 2022\n\nThese charts show how the reported vote margin (the dashed line) compares with our estimated final margin (the solid line, surrounded by bands of uncertainty) over time. When reported data comes in that is not what we expected, our model will update and incorporate this new data. - Lazaro Gamio Nov. 8, 2022\n\nRural counties in Virginia's 7th district are counting votes more quickly than its most populous and left-leaning county, Prince William. It's giving Yesli Vega, the Republican candidate, an edge over incumbent Abigail Spanberger, though this could be temporary. Here's where we think votes remain. - Kennedy Elliott Nov. 8, 2022\n\nNevada is the last big swing state of the day, and virtually everything is up for grabs: The races for Senate, three House seats, governor and secretary of state. There is also an unexpectedly competitive Senate race in Utah between Senator Mike Lee, a Republican, and Evan McMullin, an independent. - Maggie Astor Nov. 8, 2022\n\nThe shift to the right has been dramatic among counties in Florida reporting nearly all their votes. Eight of those counties that voted for Biden in 2020 shifted 16 points to the right in the race for governor, and 12 points in the Senate race. - Lazaro Gamio Nov. 8, 2022\n\nArizona has multiple races featuring Republicans who have questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 election. In Wisconsin, Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican, is up for re-election against Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, and there is a close contest for governor. - Maggie Astor Nov. 8, 2022\n\nDemocrat Tim Ryan leads Republican J.D. Vance in the returns, but almost all of the results are early votes, which we expect to disproportionately favor Democrats. Here's where we think votes remain. - Alicia Parlapiano Nov. 8, 2022\n\nSenator Raphael Warnock is out with an early lead in Georgia, but it could all be just a mirage. Most of the vote reporting so far is early, and Democrats are expected to win those votes by a large margin. - Nate Cohn Nov. 8, 2022\n\nThe Times's election forecast is now running. We use early returns and polling data to estimate in real time the outcome of the elections for Senate and House control. Here's how it works › - Nate Cohn Nov. 8, 2022\n\nPennsylvania is home to a close Senate race between Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a Democrat, and Dr. Mehmet Oz, a Republican. Michiganders are voting on abortion rights. And Kansas' Democratic governor, Laura Kelly, is in a tight re-election race, as is Gov. Janet Mills of Maine. - Maggie Astor Nov. 8, 2022\n\nRepublicans are favored to win the open Senate races in North Carolina and Ohio, but if Democrats have a better-than-expected day, these are two places we might see evidence of it. We'll also be watching competitive House races in N.C.-13 and Ohio-9. - Maggie Astor Nov. 8, 2022\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis winning the early vote in Miami-Dade County - which voted for Hillary Clinton by +29 points just six years ago - is yet another sign of growing Republican strength among Hispanic voters. - Nate Cohn Nov. 8, 2022\n\nThe Georgia Senate race, which could go to a Dec. 6 runoff, could determine which party controls the chamber. In Virginia, the performances of Democratic incumbents in the 2nd and 7th districts may offer early indications of how the party will fare in House races overall. - Maggie Astor Nov. 8, 2022\n\nRepublicans must win just 19 competitive seats to retake majority control from the Democrats. To retain control of the House, Democrats must win 46 of these seats (after accounting for the races the parties are expected to win most easily). - Alicia Parlapiano Nov. 8, 2022\n\nIn Kentucky, voters will decide whether to approve a constitutional amendment that would effectively ensure the implementation of a near-total abortion ban. In Indiana, a House race in the 1st district leans Democratic, but, if the seat were to flip, it could be an early sign of a red wave. - Maggie Astor Nov. 8, 2022\n\nIf Democrats hold onto two seats leaning their way, they will need to win three additional tossup seats to maintain control of the Senate. Republicans would need just two tossup seats beyond what they are favored to win. - Lazaro Gamio Nov. 8, 2022\n\nSix of the eight most competitive Senate races are in states that did not call a winner in the presidential race until after election night: Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. What we expect this year › - Alicia Parlapiano Nov. 8, 2022\n\nBecause of the order in which different types of ballots are counted, early returns can be misleading. In 2020, Virginia's early vote for president favored Republicans, while Pennsylvania's skewed toward Democrats. These \"mirages\" show that vote margins early in the night can change significantly. - Lazaro Gamio Nov. 8, 2022\n\nResults will begin coming in at 6 p.m. Eastern as the first polls close in Indiana and Kentucky, but the pace will really pick up with a slew of closings at 7 and 8. By 9 p.m., the polls will have closed in a majority of states. - Maggie Astor Nov. 8, 2022\n\nSource: Election results and race calls are from The Associated Press.

The state's Democratic governor, Jared Polis, quickly announced a special election would be held on June 25 to fill Mr. Buck's seat.\n\nThat left Ms. Boebert with a conundrum: If she resigned from her current seat in order to run in the special election, she would risk reducing the Republicans' already razor-thin House majority by teeing up a special election in her current district, where a Democrat has a chance of winning.\n\nTo the relief of Speaker Mike Johnson, she opted not to do that.\n\nIn 2022, Ms. Boebert nearly lost her district, which is on the Rockies' western slopes, to Adam Frisch, a Democrat . If she had resigned by May 14, it would have given Mr. Frisch a shot at winning her seat in a special election. ( Democrats have excelled at mobilizing for low turnout special elections.)\n\nNow that won't happen. Instead of running in the special election in Mr. Buck's heavily Republican district, she will keep her focus on winning a crowded Republican primary for the seat, which will be held on the same day.\n\nThat means she needs to convince Republican voters in her newly-adopted district to vote for one Republican in the special election against a Democrat, while simultaneously voting for her in the primary. That will be no mean feat in a district where she is already facing the \"carpetbagger\" aspersion. The district is in Denver's eastern suburbs and Colorado's Great Plains.\n\nMs. Boebert, who has the backing of former President Donald J. Trump, seemed to recognize her disadvantage in the statement she released on her decision. She portrayed herself as fighting a cabal of mainstream Republicans and Democrats, which she called the \"Uniparty.\"\n\n\"Ken Buck's announcement yesterday was a gift to the Uniparty,\" she said. She added: \"The establishment concocted a swampy backroom deal to try to rig an election.\"\n\nJonathan Weisman is a politics writer, covering campaigns with an emphasis on economic and labor policy.

Her fellow Republicans onstage reminded her of it repeatedly.\n\nBy Chris Cameron\n\nRepresentative Lauren Boebert, the far-right firebrand, faced off against eight Republican opponents on Thursday night in a debate in the new Colorado district she is seeking to represent in Congress.\n\nAfter barely managing to win re-election in Colorado's Third Congressional District against a Democrat in 2022, she is running this year in a much more conservative district, the Fourth. On Thursday evening, Ms. Boebert appeared at ease delivering fiery rhetoric and espousing her pro-Trump, hard-right stances among similarly conservative peers at the debate in Fort Lupton.\n\n\"Everyone will talk like a Freedom Caucus member, but there is only one who governs as a Freedom Caucus member,\" Ms. Boebert said in her opening statement, adding that she did not expect a \"coronation\" in her new district and that she looked forward to \"earning your vote.\"\n\nBut Ms. Boebert also faced steady criticism from her rivals about switching districts - having relocated to the other side of the state to improve her chances after a strong primary challenger emerged in the Third District.\n\nState Representative Mike Lynch suggested that Ms. Boebert was a \"carpetbagger\" after she brought up a drunken-driving arrest that forced Mr. Lynch to step down on Wednesday as the minority leader for Republicans in the statehouse.\n\nThe candidates mostly avoided mentioning what had landed Ms. Boebert in their district in the first place: an incident in September in which Ms. Boebert - then in the midst of completing her divorce with her husband - was caught on a security camera vaping and groping her date at a performance of the musical \"Beetlejuice.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Lauren Boebert.\n\nHer image as an attention-seeking conspiracy theorist nearly cost Boebert her congressional seat in the 2022 midterms. She won reelection in a Republican district that year by a mere 546 votes . To avoid a rematch and spare her career, she relocated to a new, even redder district on the other side of the Continental Divide for 2024. In her personal life, she got divorced, a process that wasn't pretty , and her eldest son was arrested not long after making Boebert a grandmother. Boebert's postdivorce dating life made its own set of headlines after a particularly handsy outing to the Beetlejuice musical.\n\nBut Boebert may just get away with it all. If the polling is anywhere near correct, she's set to cruise to a primary win on Tuesday night on her new turf.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nBoebert's days were numbered in her old district. After coming out of nowhere to nearly defeat her in 2022, Democrat Adam Frisch had announced that he would challenge her again in Colorado's 3 rd District, covering the state's Western Slope and extending east along its southern border. Frisch would not suffer from a lack of funds as he tried once again to take out an MSNBC archvillain. He has raised more than $13 million this cycle, an unfathomable amount for a former Aspen City Council member in an R+7 district. Boebert, with her own national profile, was raising a fair share in her own right, but Frisch was blowing her numbers out of the water quarter after quarter in 2023.\n\nFacing this tidal wave of cash, Boebert announced late last year that she would swap mountains for plains and run in Colorado's 4 th District, on the other side of the state, in an open seat vacated by retiring Rep. Ken Buck. She described this act of moving to a safer Republican district as a matter of self-sacrifice.\n\n\"Since the first day I ran for public office, I promised I would do whatever it takes to stop the socialists and the communists from taking over our country,\" she said in a Dec. 27 Facebook video . \"That means staying in the fight. But it also means not allowing Hollywood elites and progressive money groups to buy the 3 rd District, a seat that they have no business owning. I will not allow dark money that is directed at destroying me personally to steal this seat. It's not fair to the 3 rd District and the conservatives there who have fought so hard for our victories.\"\n\nSaying that she'd become too toxic to keep the 3 rd District for Republicans was a reasonable explanation for why she wouldn't run for reelection there. Her explanation that moving to a new part of the state would give her and her children a \"fresh start\" following a difficult year too made sense. What she would have to find a way to explain, though, was why she deserved to represent this new part of the state-an entirely separate biome-in Congress, aside from paycheck continuity.\n\nGiven that Buck had already announced his plan not to run again a couple of months before Boebert's switch, the race was already full of candidates who were ready and eager to slam Boebert's carpetbagging. Among them were state House Minority Leader Mike Lynch, County Commissioner and former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg, conservative talk radio host Deborah Flora, state Rep. Richard Holtorf, and former state Rep. Ted Harvey.\n\nDespite Boebert's own unserious reputation, though, her competitors had problems of their own. Lynch had to quit his leadership post in the Statehouse after a 2022 drunk driving arrest surfaced. Harvey was under scrutiny for allegations of having run a \"scam PAC\" that had spent an unusually high amount of its funds raised on \"operating expenses.\" Holtorf, who once was in such a hurry to cast a vote against abortion rights that he dropped his gun on the Capitol's marble floor, revealed that he had once paid for a girlfriend's abortion. (He also said that he had once \"had another beautiful woman\" whom he'd impregnated but that the child had been put up for adoption.) In a January debate, six of nine candidates raised their hands when asked whether they'd been arrested, and Boebert and Lynch gave each other a high-five. In other words, groping a date at Beetlejuice: The Musical wasn't that atypical of a Sunday night by the field's standards.\n\nBoebert had a few other notable advantages over her competitors. Her fundraising numbers, which were a pittance compared to Frisch's in the old district, were well above those of the primary competition in the new district. Donald Trump endorsed her . And she won the prized top line on the ballot at a local GOP assembly in April.\n\nAt least as importantly as all that, though, is that the field never consolidated around a single candidate with the best chance to take on Boebert. The prime opportunity for that came in March, after Buck announced that he would be leaving Congress early instead of at the end of the year. This triggered a special election, also to be held this Tuesday, for the remainder of Buck's term. Boebert opted not to run in that special election and instead to finish out her term in the 3 rd District. That gave the other candidates a shot to earn a leg up in the primary by appearing on the ballot as both a primary candidate and the special election candidate. Instead, local party officials selected a placeholder candidate, Greg Lopez, for the special election. Sonnenberg came in a narrow second.\n\nAnd so the polling in the six-way field looks the way that it does. A survey from earlier this month from Kaplan Strategies found Boebert at 40 percent, with no other candidate above 5 percent and many more undecided. It's the celebrity vs. the unidentifiable blob.\n\nBoebert had switched to this more conservative district believing she'd finally be free of general election worries and the avalanche of money from \"Hollywood elites\" and the \"socialists and communists.\" But there is no escaping from the libs' cash. While Frisch's fundraising numbers have slowed since Boebert left the 3 rd District, Democrats in the 4 th District-who are not supposed to have any chance whatsoever-have seen theirs rise. Just one Democratic primary contender, retired Marine Ike McCorkle, raised $462,000 between April and mid-June. He outraised Boebert by more than $100,000.\n\nMcCorkle was Democrats' nominee in the 4 th District the past two cycles, and in neither case did he come within 20 points of Ken Buck. Now, Lauren Boebert is no Ken Buck. Since unseating an incumbent in the 2020 Republican primary, she hasn't stopped making headlines for her antics. Minutes into her first term, she made a video about why she'd carry her Glock into the Capitol. She repeatedly cracked a joke about Rep. Ilhan Omar being a terrorist. She obviously was all over QAnon. And yet, even for all of the embarrassment she courts, her district's GOP lean should be enough to carry her.\n\nBut if this one is also too close for comfort in the end? There won't be a redder place in Colorado for Boebert to turn to.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

If so, first of all, congratulations on being some sort of mindfulness genius -hope you enjoyed your weekend of hiking and reading poetry. Second, here's the latest:\n\nBoebert initially denied that she had been vaping at a Denver performance of Beetlejuice: The Musical , from which she was ejected on Sept. 10. Security footage from the venue, though, caught her blowing out a big fat cloud of ... vape steam, or whatever, while seated. (You will never catch me trying to smoke out of a mechanical pencil.) She then issued an apology statement that included the all-time apology phrase \"I genuinely did not recall vaping that evening.\"\n\nThe security footage also captured Boebert rubbing her hand on her date's crotch while he grabbed one of her breasts. Talk to your teens tonight about whether they are \"Boeberting\" and, if so, whether they know how to do it safely.\n\nBoebert's date, the New York Post reports, is the co-owner of a bar in Aspen, Colorado, that hosted a drag performance in January. (Yes, Lauren Boebert represents Aspen . And like others in her political cohort, she has complained that drag shows are corrupting American children and softening its military and so forth. In fact, she tweeted about that subject Monday morning.)\n\nBack in Washington, Boebert and the other hard-right members of the House Freedom Caucus will be playing an important role in this week's negotiations over whether to continue funding the operations of government. The latest news there is that the Freedom Caucus reached an agreement with the GOP's moderate \"Main Street Caucus\" on a bill that would fund the government through Oct. 31 ... but that it may not even garner enough support to pass the Republican-held House, much less the Democrat-held Senate because it includes 8 percent cuts to spending and would cut off military aid to Ukraine.\n\nOther MAGA House Republicans, meanwhile, are insisting that funding be tied to the termination of Jack Smith's special counsel prosecution of Donald Trump. Sounds like it's gonna be a long week! The kind of stressful environment, in other words, that can make a member of Congress want to take the edge off with a few hits from the vape pen and a quick- [ looks at editor ] ha-ha, actually, let's go in another direction here ...

      "text": "Biden's Race Isn't the Only One at Stake for Democrats This Election\n\nIn the wake of last Thursday's debate debacle, President Joe Biden and his defenders are pushing back against calls for him to abandon his reelection bid by claiming that he can still beat Trump .\n\nBut that assertion is deeply questionable and ignores a much bigger problem: how dire things could get for downballot politicians if Biden stays in the race.\n\nOn Saturday night, two days after the debate, I helped my son cater a Democratic Party fundraiser in Durango, Colorado, for Adam Frisch, the Democratic candidate for Congress in the state's 3 rd District, Lauren Boebert's current district.\n\nCD-3 is massive . It takes up almost half the state and is bigger than Pennsylvania. It is mostly rural, though its largest city is Pueblo, a traditional manufacturing town. Outside Pueblo, the economy is a mix of farming, ranching, oil and gas, mining, education, and outdoor recreation. The district contains the headwaters of the Colorado River system that provides water for six states.\n\nRepublicans enjoy a 5 percent registration advantage over Democrats, but 42 percent of voters are independents. Hispanic Coloradans make up 26 percent of the population; virtually all the rest of the population is white.\n\nCD-3's rural character and whiteness, as well as the increasing conservatism of Western Hispanics, make it a tough district for Democrats. But it is winnable. Frisch nearly beat Boebert in 2022, losing by only 546 votes . The prospect of a rematch with him scared her so badly that she decamped to the other side of the state to run in a district with a 20 percent Republican registration advantage.\n\nWhat makes Frisch formidable in this swing district is that, although he has the disadvantage of being a rich former finance guy who lives in Aspen, he is, by disposition, a political moderate. In fact, Biden's kind of guy. And he has done the work. He has learned the issues that matter here: water, energy, land use. For three years, he has traveled constantly to every town and hamlet. He meets regularly with groups Democrats tend to ignore-the Cattlemen's Association, mining and energy interests, business groups.\n\nBut now that Boebert has fled, Frisch has a much tougher race. Republicans have nominated an unremarkable Grand Junction lawyer who is conservative and Trump-supporting but not insane. In short, a great fit for R+5 CD-3. Frisch can still win, but he needs big turnout from Democrats and from persuadable independents.\n\nWhich brings us back to Biden and the Frisch fundraiser.\n\nAt the end of the Q&A session, one bold soul raised the question on everyone's mind: What did Frisch think about the debate and its effect on Biden's prospects and his own?\n\nCarefully, respectfully, Frisch told the crowd of Democratic loyalists that although he admired the president's governing accomplishments, he had been concerned about Biden's age for years. Then, sometimes elliptically, but in the end unmistakably, Frisch confessed to thinking that the debate collapse made Biden's reelection unlikely. As he put it, governance is important, but in order to govern, you have to be elected.\n\nWhen pressed further, Frisch grudgingly admitted that Biden's age and now-undeniable frailty made his own election in Colorado tougher too. And, though he carefully avoided saying so directly, the candidate made it clear that he hoped Democratic Party elders would have serious conversations with the president about withdrawing from the race. (A few days later, Frisch issued a video statement and an op-ed unequivocally calling for Biden to withdraw.)\n\nWhen Frisch finished speaking, a remarkable and telling thing happened. No one in that crowd of lifelong Democrats raised so much as a murmur of dissent.\n\nI have since been told that, unsurprisingly, there are local Democrats who disagree-some quite strongly-with Frisch's position on the viability of Biden's candidacy. Nonetheless, my own assessment is that the vast majority of attendees at the gathering understood two things that Biden's inner circle must accept.\n\nFirst, Biden's collapse at the debate was not merely a slight wobble, an off day that anyone might have and recover from. It was, at the least, powerful evidence that the president is, sadly, too old to serve four more years. The committed Democrats in that Colorado barn on Saturday-not one of them a Biden hater or member of the coastal elite media-saw what the world saw during the debate. None of them tried to deny the obvious. And none of them raised a voice to deny the obvious consequence: If this aged and diminished Biden remains in the race, the risk that he will lose to Donald Trump is very high indeed, and certainly far higher than it was before the debate.\n\nSecond, if Biden stays in the race, he is likely to drag swing-district Democrats like Adam Frisch down with him. In a presidential year, turnout is driven by voters' reactions to the presidential race. Hardcore Democrats and Republicans will come out and vote for their party's presidential and congressional nominees regardless of individual merit. But many independents and lukewarm Democrats-the people that both Biden and congressional Democrats like Frisch need to win-could be more likely to stay home in disgust or despair.\n\nIf they do, they will not be voting in downballot races at all. Not only could Biden lose, but lots of other Democrats across the country could lose too. And if that happens, Trump could enter the presidency without even the check of one or more houses of Congress in Democratic control.\n\nI admire Biden immensely. He has long been an exemplary public servant. He has accomplished great things in his first term. Perhaps, despite last week's debate, he can somehow pull off an electoral miracle. But I doubt it. Replacing him would be awkward, to be sure. But I think that a Democrat, almost any Democrat, younger, more vigorous, and free of the baggage with which years of disingenuous Republican attacks have saddled Biden, now has a better chance of beating Trump.\n\nBiden needs to do one last agonizing, soul-searing service for the country he loves. Step aside. Let a new generation take up the fight. If he will not do that, then the Trumpian darkness he rightly fears is more likely to fall. And if it does, that catastrophe will properly be laid, at least in part, to his charge.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "House Republican Strategy of Elevating Unstable Clown People Reveals Itself to Have Downsides\n\nThe biggest story on Capitol Hill this Thursday is that, according to the Daily Beast , Republican Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called Republican Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert \"a little bitch\" on the floor of the House of Representatives on Wednesday.\n\nCorrection-that's according to the Daily Beast and Rep. Greene herself, who explained her reasoning to Semafor:\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene explains her feud with Lauren Boebert: https://t.co/RU1BO1QyKk pic.twitter.com/K5uzEJCOv7\n\nMakes sense!\n\nAt this moment, you might be asking yourself, Am I reading the political news or watching Real Housewives of the freakin' District of Columbia? First of all, that's a pretty dated/obvious joke; let's try to keep things a little fresher. Second, this incident, as much as it seems like a tawdry matter of debasing gossip, actually speaks in an important (?) way to the Dynamics of Power in the Beltway.\n\nTo understand why, consider what drew Greene and Boebert into conflict-their competing resolutions to impeach President Joe Biden. \"You copied my articles of impeachment after I asked you to cosponsor them,\" Greene is said to have told Boebert on Wednesday. Greene filed articles of impeachment against Biden in May; Boebert filed hers this week, but as a \"privileged resolution,\" which means they must be considered immediately.\n\nSpeaker of the House Kevin McCarthy does not want to consider impeaching Joe Biden, now or ever. (He's hoping to route Boebert's articles to committee .) Biden's approval ratings aren't great, but voters predominantly don't believe he's running a \"crime family,\" as the right wing has it. (Greene's most recent Biden impeachment filing-it's her sixth-accuses him of deliberately compromising national security by failing to complete Donald Trump's \"border wall.\" ) In 2022, voters also tended not to support Republican candidates who took Trumpy positions on issues like election denial as much as Republican candidates who did not. (See the section of the preceding link called \"When the Opposition Party Can't Balance.\") And impeaching Biden for imaginary crimes would be \"Trump vibes,\" as young people say.\n\nMcCarthy's task as speaker is in some way like that of all Republican speakers before him: Keeping his party's most conservative voters and legislators happy without becoming perceived as so extreme as to lose seats in the next election. It is also very different than the task of speakers before him, because \"conservatism\" has been increasingly defined, by a certain Florida-based criminal defendant, as acting like a reckless idiot and believing in things that didn't happen . McCarthy is managing a caucus which includes a significant contingent of members who are liable to say in public, for instance, that individuals connected to the Italian military used satellites to change 2020 votes from Trump to Biden. (That is a real accusation that a Republican representative texted to the Republican White House chief of staff in January 2021 .)\n\nGreene and Boebert both come from this wing of the party. McCarthy has appealed to Greene by giving her committee assignments and consulting with her on leadership matters ; in return, he's gotten such concessions as Greene not filing her impeachment bills as privileged resolutions, which means that the House isn't obligated to vote on them, which means no Republican in a vulnerable seat has to decide whether to put themselves on the record voting for crazypants stuff.\n\nPut another way, though, the more cooperative and team-oriented Republican in this story called another Republican a little bitch on the floor of the House for \"copycatting\" her plan to hold an impeachment no one wants over the issue of building Donald Trump's border wall. Maybe McCarthy should call Bravo executive and Real Housewives producer Andy Cohen for some advice!

      "text": "They Came. They Squawked. They Squandered Their Leverage.\n\nIn November, a characteristically impassioned Texas Rep. Chip Roy unloaded in a House floor speech about how lousy a job House Republicans were doing.\n\n\"One thing. I want my Republican colleagues to give me one thing - one! -that I can go campaign on and say we did. One!\" he shouted, inviting anybody hanging around listening to \"come explain to me one material, meaningful, significant thing the Republican majority has done besides 'Well, I guess it's not as bad as the Democrats.' \"\n\nRoy is policy chair of the House Freedom Caucus, the group of a few dozen far-right Republicans whose rigid demands and relentless threats to oust GOP leadership have mired the House of Representatives in dysfunction. Its members include Lauren Boebert, Jim Jordan, and Chairman Bob Good; Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene are kindred ideological spirits. (Greene was a part of its ranks until she was booted last year, for being too mean to other caucus members.)\n\nFive months after his epic rant, Roy and his chums have the same amount to celebrate-basically nothing-and a lot more to complain about. The House finally passed into law government-funding bills for the rest of the fiscal year at levels far too high for the hard-liners' taste. It also finally pushed through security assistance for Ukraine without any border security reforms or changes attached, and without any corresponding spending cuts.\n\nThe hard right had been able, at least , to secure the impeachment of a cabinet secretary-but then had to watch Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer crumple up the articles and toss them into the wastebasket in half an afternoon's work.\n\nLet's be honest. House Republicans (and especially Freedom Caucus Republicans) were never going to get much out of this Congress. The greatest accomplishment of their incredibly slim House majority was always going to be that they blocked the Democratic agenda for two years. Beyond that, not much Republican agenda enactment was going to be achieved between their own slim voting margins, a Democratic Senate, and a Democratic White House. The Freedom Caucus either doesn't get this or pretends not to.\n\nBut the hard-liners have not merely been idle bystanders, whining aimlessly as they get outvoted. They have made policy outcomes actively worse for Republicans. Their insistence on maximalist wins-rather than incremental gains proportional to their junior-partner stake in running the country-lessened conservative achievements by throwing Republican leaders into the arms of Democrats in order to pass necessary items.\n\nThey have to know this. This is not a dynamic that's difficult to understand or that they haven't been lectured about a thousand times. Freedom Caucus members weren't born yesterday. They just prioritize the politics of crying betrayal over any small policy successes.\n\nHouse Republicans had two central leverage points in this Congress: the debt ceiling and aid for Ukraine. On both occasions, Republicans could have influenced the outcomes to their advantage. On both occasions, anger from the far right about how the wins didn't go far enough undercut any GOP negotiating power.\n\nThough it may seem like ancient history now, it was only one year ago that then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy was in the middle of executing a successful debt-ceiling strategy. He kept House Republicans united on the need for the Biden administration to negotiate with them in exchange for raising the debt ceiling, forcing the White House to enter talks. In the end, McCarthy's negotiators secured a reasonable budget deal to trim domestic spending while giving a small boost to defense spending. It was a modest reversal of the previous year's budget agreement from when Democrats were in charge, and an acknowledgment of the 2022 \"Red Ripple\" midterms, during which Republicans flipped nine House seats on net. Given that the spending agreement was reached relatively early last year too, it would have given conservatives an opportunity to achieve another stated goal: consideration of the 12 government spending bills one by one, rather than having a single omnibus spending bill jammed down their throats at the end of the year.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus revolted , blocking McCarthy's agenda until he agreed to cut spending further beyond the deal he'd just agreed to. The whole process, then, went completely off-track after McCarthy was ousted as speaker and the newly installed speaker, Mike Johnson, had to learn the ropes. When all was said and done, \"full-year government funding\" wasn't achieved until nearly halfway through the fiscal year, late last month . All the far-right griping achieved, in other words, was the delayed implementation of domestic spending cuts.\n\nNevertheless, the Freedom Caucus claimed betrayal .\n\nSimilarly, on Ukraine funding, Republicans had a real opportunity to achieve meaningful reforms to border policy. Republican leaders in both the House and Senate insisted that Democrats engage in border talks in exchange for Ukraine funding. Democrats agreed.\n\nAfter months of discussions, a group of three senators-one Republican, one independent, and one Democrat-reached a border deal that would have required the administration to, among other things, restrict asylum claims when southern border encounters surged. It was the first time in modern memory that Democrats had agreed to a major immigration deal that was almost entirely enforcement-based, without insisting in return on immigrants' being guaranteed a path to legal status or citizenship.\n\nThe far right, largely at the beckoning of Donald Trump, killed the deal before it was even released. They didn't try to tinker with it or ask for amendments to fix things here or there. It was rejected out of hand.\n\nSo, what Republicans got out of their Ukraine leverage was zero. Zip. There was nothing in the package of foreign policy bills that the House passed last weekend that addressed the border. The Freedom Caucus likes to believe that Republicans had enough leverage on Ukraine that they would ultimately get Democrats to swallow conservatives' very strict border bill, H.R. 2-a demand that calls into question how many of them have ever spoken to a Democrat. Ukraine aid passed with over 300 votes.\n\nOnce again, the Freedom Caucus claimed betrayal .\n\nBetrayal, then, is the \"one thing\"-repeated multiple times over-that Roy and other members of the hard right can campaign on (aside from being \"not as bad as the Democrats,\" which is more-than-adequate reelection material in nearly all of these members' districts). They fought and fought, they'll say, only to be betrayed by the Republican leader of any given moment, who-no matter how conservative their bona fides-always reveals themself to be a secret Democrat.\n\nThe House functions now only because an uneasy coalition of Democrats and practical Republicans wills it to do so. The rest, as a byproduct of that, rack up and sell complaints.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

It was a warm, sunny afternoon in 2019 in Aurora, Colorado, and the then-presidential candidate stood on the steps of city hall talking to voters about gun control . As the crowd shared stories and fears about the state of gun culture in the U.S., O'Rourke pledged to pursue aggressive gun control measures. Then a petite woman in the front row was handed the mic.\n\n\"My name is Lauren and I drove down here from Rifle, Colorado, to speak with you today,\" she said. \"I was one of the gun-owning Americans that heard your speech and heard what you had to say regarding, 'Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15s and your AK-47s,'\" she continued, referring to a response O'Rourke had given during a Democratic presidential debate just days earlier.\n\nSome in the crowd began to cheer and shout \"Hell yeah!,\" but O'Rourke asked them to \"be respectful.\" Suddenly, the woman seemed to tap into deeper confidence: \"Well, I am here to say, 'Hell no. You're not.'\"\n\nO'Rourke, of course, did not go on to win his election, but the woman - a 32-year-old, gun-themed restaurant owner named Lauren Boebert - did. At the time, Boebert was not yet running for Congress. But after her confrontation with O'Rourke went semi-viral among the right, landing her an appearance on Fox News and headlines in the National Review , Boebert decided to challenge incumbent Republican Rep. Scott Tipton in her home district, Colorado's 3rd. Her 55-percent-to-45-percent victory in the Republican primary on June 30, 2020, was one of the biggest shocks of the cycle.\n\nThe moment with O'Rourke that launched Boebert's political career is striking because it captures so much of what voters liked about the congresswoman during that first campaign. She was ballsy, a small business owner with no political experience, and attuned to the issues that people in her community were talking about. But today, two terms in, many of her former supporters feel she's become a D.C. insider who's out of touch with the district and whose ballsiness looks more like impertinence.\n\nNow, after nearly losing her seat in 2022 and surviving an objectively awful year in her personal life , Boebert is starting over on the other side of the state . Running in the 4th Congressional District in Colorado's Eastern Plains, she's hoping to reignite some of that early appeal in the state's most conservative district - where, if she can win over enough voters in the June primary, she'll be virtually guaranteed a seat in Congress as long as she wants it. There are a number of things working in her favor - name recognition, a crowded primary and a healthy war chest - but will they be enough for Boebert to inspire the same kind of support she had when she was just Lauren from Rifle?\n\nWhen Boebert first decided to run for office in late 2019, many doubted that a little-known, Trumpy millennial stood much of a chance against a five-term incumbent.\n\nThough Boebert enjoyed some name recognition from owning Shooters Grill - a gun-themed restaurant that attracted national media attention , where servers openly carried firearms - she was still at a disadvantage. Tipton had represented the district in Congress since 2011 and was a member of the state legislature before that. Boebert had no political experience, even less money - and, to top it all off, former President Donald Trump had endorsed Tipton .\n\nBut Boebert was dedicated to hitting the campaign trail, and she had a charismatic speaking style and a message that resonated. Laura Carno, a Republican political strategist who worked on Boebert's 2020 campaign, said the candidate had a tenacious work ethic: She visited every county, and drove the district end-to-end (a more than eight-hour excursion) in a single day multiple times.\n\n\"I've worked on a number of campaigns in my career, and I've never seen a candidate work as hard as she did,\" Carno said.\n\nGun rights were at the forefront of her campaign, as they were on voters' minds - the state had recalled two state senators just a few years prior for being too bullish on gun control, and Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 thrust gun violence into the national conversation . In the end, some of Boebert's perceived weaknesses actually added to her appeal, according to Kevin McCarney, who was then the GOP chair for Mesa County, the 3rd District's second-most populous county. \"She resonated as someone who wasn't a politician, which was a big message at that point in time, especially after what happened with Trump,\" McCarney said. \"And she was definitely a Trump girl.\"\n\nBut a lot can change in four years. Even before she got to Capitol Hill, Boebert began making national headlines, and not necessarily for reasons her constituents liked. There was her comment about hoping the QAnon conspiracy theory was real , the dispute with Capitol police over her Glock setting off metal detectors , the time she called fellow Rep. Ilhan Omar a member of the \"jihad squad\" (she later apologized for the remark).\n\nTo call her a controversial figure would be an understatement. She's part of a cohort of far-right obstructionists in Congress - largely from the Freedom Caucus - whose goal seems to be to make life harder for other politicians, even from their own party . She's an election denier who has made comments supportive of Christian nationalism and has sponsored or supported bills ranging from impeaching President Joe Biden for withdrawing from Afghanistan to a resolution that sought to strip a win from a transgender swimmer.\n\nAs I've written before , Colorado's 3rd District, though reliably red, doesn't look like other districts represented by Boebert's fellow hardline Republicans: It's less white, less evangelical Christian and less Republican. While she still maintained a coterie of devoted fans, each headline-grabbing stunt chipped away at her popularity back home. It wasn't that voters on the Western Slope always disapproved of her behavior (though some certainly did), but instead, they felt that it was evidence she was more interested in her own image and celebrity than in representing her constituents.\n\n\"People thought that she had - I'm gonna use the language [I've heard others use] -'gone Hollywood,' because they felt like it was more about her and her fame, as opposed to representing the district,\" said Carno. This was reflected in a poll of the 3rd District conducted last spring by Global Strategy Group. When asked if the description \"more focused on getting attention than getting things done,\" matched Boebert, 55 percent of voters said that it described her \"well\" or \"very well,\" and 44 percent called her \"an embarrassment to Colorado.\"\n\nThe damage caught up to her in the 2022 midterms, when she came within a few hundred votes of losing her seat to Democratic candidate Adam Frisch. Things only got worse from there as Boebert's personal life began to unravel. She and her husband embarked on a messy divorce ; she was kicked out of a performance of \"Beetlejuice,\" the musical, for being loud, vaping and groping her date ; and her 18-year-old son was arrested and charged with multiple felonies.\n\nAt the end of the year, Boebert made an announcement on Facebook . She wouldn't be running for reelection in the 3rd District, where she claimed \"dark money that is directed at destroying me personally\" could \"steal\" the seat (her spin on the six-figure Democratic attack ad campaign being lobbed against her). Instead, she moved her family to Windsor, in the state's 4th District, from which then-Rep. Ken Buck had recently announced he would be retiring. Along with concerns that staying in the 3rd District could give Democrats the opportunity to flip the seat (which went for Trump by 6 percentage points in 2020), Boebert framed the move as a \"fresh start\" for her and her sons after such a tumultuous year.\n\n\"I've made my own personal mistakes and have owned up and apologized for them,\" Boebert said. \"It's been humbling and challenging, but it's also given me perspective and helped me grow.\"\n\nBut while the 4th District (which went for Trump by 16 points in 2020) is a safe seat for just about any Republican in the general election, Boebert still needs to get through a tough primary on June 25 before she can rest easy. Sure, she's started out with more name recognition than she did in her upstart 2020 campaign, but given all the negative headlines about her, that isn't necessarily a good thing. And she can no longer fall back on being a political outsider after two terms in D.C. or claim to be deeply connected to the district. No, this deep-red district has been skeptical of the congresswoman, at least to start.\n\n\"The red carpet was not rolled out for her in January,\" said Drew Sexton, a spokesperson for Boebert's campaign. Indeed, a February poll of likely Republican voters in the 4th District found 42 percent had an unfavorable view of Boebert, more than the 38 percent who had a favorable view. And of the 49 percent who said they weren't certain who they would vote for in the primary, 63 percent said it wouldn't be Boebert.\n\nThere are also five other candidates, including some current or former officeholders, vying for the nomination in the 4th District - something serious politicians typically don't dare to do against an incumbent. For instance, there's former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg, who also represented part of the region in the state House. Sonnenberg has been endorsed by three former senators - Cory Gardner, Wayne Allard and Hank Brown - and has plenty of local bona fides, having worked as a farmer and rancher in the region for decades. There's also Deborah Flora, a former Miss Colorado and local talk radio host who is a well-known Republican voice in the community.\n\nBut there's a lot working in Boebert's favor too. Unlike that first primary four years ago, Boebert now has a huge fundraising advantage , by a factor of 10: She's raked in close to $3.5 million compared to the $356,000 raised by the next-highest fundraiser, Flora. And this time around, she's the one with Trump's endorsement .\n\nAccording to Sexton, Boebert has also held onto her hard work ethic from her first campaign; she has made 50 campaign appearances across the district already this year. \"Saturday the 30th before Easter, she drove from Windsor to Elbert County for their County Assembly, kept driving to Baca County for their Lincoln Day Dinner, back up to Crowley County for their Meat-In Dinner, and then returned home to take her boys to Easter service with supporters in Yuma County,\" Sexton wrote in an email. \"All told, that's about 1,000 miles of driving for the weekend.\"\n\nIndeed, the spark she ignited on the Western Slope in 2020 seems to be rekindling on the other side of the state. In Colorado, there are two ways for candidates to get on the ballot for a primary election: either by collecting signatures or earning at least 30 percent of the vote at the district assembly (a meeting of local party organizers and devotees). Boebert managed to do both, and she even took top billing at the 4th District assembly in April . Now, the firebrand congresswoman is just one more first-place finish away from what is probably a safe House seat for life.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "New York, Colorado and Utah primaries 2024: Bowman loses, Boebert wins\n\nThree Trump-endorsed candidates also lost in Republican primaries.\n\nJune 25 was one of the most jam-packed primary election days of the year: Democrats and Republicans in Colorado, New York, Utah and parts of South Carolina picked their party's nominees for this fall's elections.\n\nTwo incumbent representatives - Jamaal Bowman and Lauren Boebert - who have made enemies inside and outside their own parties faced serious challengers in their primaries, but they met with different fates. Bowman lost to a more moderate Democrat, George Latimer, in what was the most expensive congressional primary in history. However, Boebert easily prevailed in her Republican primary despite running in an entirely new district.\n\nIt was also a bad night for former President Donald Trump. Going into these primaries, only one candidate he had endorsed for Senate, House or governor had lost; tonight alone, three did, including his preferred candidate to replace retiring Sen. Mitt Romney in Utah.\n\nIn addition, the fields are now set in some key congressional matchups this fall. In Colorado, Republicans avoided nominating far-right candidates who could have put normally safe red districts in play. Meanwhile, Democrats picked their fighters in two competitive New York House districts that could help them reclaim the House majority.\n\n538 reporters and contributors broke down the election results as they came in with live updates, analysis and commentary. Read our full live blog below.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, businessman and state Rep. Gabe Evans has won the Republican Primary for Colorado's 8th Congressional District. With 64 percent of the vote reporting, he currently has a 78 percent to 22 percent lead over his opponent, Janak Joshi, a physician and former state representative.\n\nEvans will face off against incumbent Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo, who won the district by 1,600 votes in 2022. It is the most competitive seat in Colorado according to the Cook Political Report's Partisan Voter Index.\n\n-G. Elliott Morris, 538\n\nThe AP projects that Lauren Boebert will win the GOP nomination in Colorado's 4th District . With 66 percent of the expected votes in and Boebert at a sizable lead above her next closest competitor, Deb Flora, it's (as my dad would say) all over but the crying. Boebert had a big fundraising advantage, Trump's endorsement, and obviously has a ton of name recognition, but after the headlines of the last year, that didn't necessarily equate with a guaranteed win. She had her work cut out for her in this new district, according to her campaign, where voters were skeptical of her reputation. But she reportedly put in the work, trekking all across this district over the last few months. A spokesperson for her campaign told me last month that on Easter weekend alone , she drove the district end-to-end for multiple campaign stops, totaling about 1,000 miles. Whatever combination of hard work, notoriety and deep pockets seems to have worked, and now she can all but cruise into the seat in November in this deep red district.\n\n-Kaleigh Rogers, 538\n\nWith nearly half of the vote reporting in Colorado's 3rd and 8th Congressional Districts, mainline Republican candidates Jeff Hurd and Gabe Evans have pulled ahead of the competition. Evans is endorsed by both Trump and the conservative activist organization Americans for Prosperity, funded by the influential Republican Koch brothers, so no surprises here really. Hurd's race was closer though. Going into the night he had a clear fundraising advantage and the support of several \"normie\" Republican organizations - like the national cattleman's association and the association of automobile dealers. A victory for Hurd (which looks likely, but there's quite a few rural votes left to be counted) would be a defeat for the other MAGA-aligned candidates in the race - such as Ron Hanks, who has previously called himself a \"pro-Trump warrior\" .\n\n-G. Elliott Morris, 538\n\nIn perhaps the highest-profile race of the evening, Latimer leads Bowman 56 percent to 44 percent in the Democratic primary for New York's 16th District, with a little more than a quarter of the overall expected vote reporting, per the AP. Bowman is running up huge numbers in the small part of the district that's in the Bronx - he leads 84 percent to 16 percent there - but about nine-tenths of the district's population lives in Westchester County, where Latimer currently leads 69 percent to 31 percent.\n\n-Geoffrey Skelley, 538\n\nIn the Republican runoff in South Carolina's 3rd District, 12 percent of the expected vote has reported, and Biggs leads Burns by about 8 percentage points, 54 percent to 46 percent, according to the Associated Press. Remember, Burns has Trump's endorsement, but the early returns suggest a potentially close race. Still, there's a long way to go.\n\n-Geoffrey Skelley, 538"

With 60 percent of the expected vote reporting, Latimer leads about 55 percent to 45 percent. While Bowman has performed extremely well in the small part of the district located in the Bronx, most of the seat is in Westchester, which Latimer is carrying handily. This race was defined largely by internal Democratic divisions over the Israel-Hamas conflict and the influence of pro-Israel groups, although controversies about Bowman's past behavior certainly made him more vulnerable. Most notably, though, United Democracy Project, a super PAC affiliated with the pro-Israel group AIPAC, spent $14.8 million to take down Bowman, who like many in the progressive \"Squad\" has been sharply critical of Israel's military operations in Gaza (although he also condemned Hamas, too).\n\nBowman becomes the first Democratic incumbent to lose renomination this cycle and probably the third to lose a primary overall. Republican Rep. Jerry Carl of Alabama lost renomination in an incumbent-versus-incumbent race brought about by redistricting in March, while Republican Rep. Bob Good appears likely to lose his primary in Virginia, although the June 18 primary result was close and Good intends to pay for a recount .\n\n-Geoffrey Skelley, 538\n\nThere's a reason why we average! The Ohio race was super sleepy. This Colorado race was taking place at the same time as a high-profile Republican primary election in the same district. Best not to read anything too much into any individual result.\n\n-Jacob Rubashkin, Inside Elections\n\nAs you mentioned earlier, Jacob, Trump won Colorado's 4th District by 19 points in 2020, so Lopez's 21-point win is pretty much exactly in line with the partisanship of the district. That's notable in a year when Democrats have made a lot of hay out of their overperformances in recent special elections, like in Ohio's 6th District a couple weeks ago. It's a good reminder that individual special election results can be noisy. That said, Democrats are still punching above their weight in special elections this year on average by about 6 points, and historically, overperformance in special elections has augured general-election success.\n\n-Nathaniel Rakich, 538\n\nThe AP projects that Greg Lopez will win the special election for Colorado's 4th District, which was vacated by Republican Ken Buck. The former Parker, Colorado, mayor leads Democrat Trisha Calvarese, 58 to 35 percent, with 80 percent of the expected vote counted.\n\n-Jacob Rubashkin, Inside Elections"

      "text": "Screaming match breaks out in House after vote to censure Democrat Al Green\n\nDemocrats began singing from the House well \"We Shall Overcome.\"\n\nThe House voted on Thursday to censure Democrat Al Green over his outburst at President Donald Trump's speech to Congress on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Republican-led effort passed 224-198 with two members voting present, one of them being Green. Ten Democrats voted to censure Green.\n\nThe Texas Democrat was immediately called to the well for a public reading of the resolution by Speaker Mike Johnson. Green and other Democrats surrounding him there began singing the civil rights anthem \"We Shall Overcome,\" which prompted the Republican side to yell \"order.\"\n\nA screaming match between House Democrats and Republicans broke out. At one point, Democratic Rep. Ayanna Pressley yelled back, \"Shame on you!\" Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib also shouted at Republicans.\n\nIn a brief appearance on Fox News after the vote, Johnson called it \"a really sad day for our institution.\"\n\nRep. Andy Ogles, a hardline member of the House Freedom Caucus, posted on X he's already drafting a resolution to remove each of the Democrats who demonstrated alongside Green from their committees.\n\nGreen spoke on the House floor hours after being censured. He read the resolution aloud and offered his own commentary.\n\n\"Mr. Speaker and still I rise,\" Green said, \"and still I rise a proud, liberated Democrat, unbought, unbossed and unafraid.\"\n\nGreen continued to criticize Trump's agenda and animatedly explained why he and other Democrats sang in the well, calling it an \"act of incivility.\"\n\n\"We have to not allow [Trump's] incivility, his requirement of fealty, to prevent us from taking the necessary actions to protect liberty and justice for all, to protect government of the people, by the people, for the people ... We have to do what is necessary. I believe we have to engage in a level of positive, righteous incivility.\"\n\nThe censure resolution was introduced by Rep. Dan Newhouse, who called Green's behavior on Tuesday \"unacceptable.\" Democrats tried and failed on Wednesday evening to block the measure.\n\nA censure resolution is a formal reprimand by the House for violations of the chamber's code of conduct. A vote to censure a member of the House does not hold any power beyond a public condemnation of the member's behavior and it does not deny the member privileges.\n\nCensuring House members has been historically rare, but in the last few years we've seen members from both political parties use this as a political tool. Green is the fifth member of Congress to be censured in this decade.\n\nSome House Republicans are floating more punitive measures against Green. The House Freedom Caucus said its members plan to try to strip Green of his committee assignments next week.\n\nGreen is not the only lawmaker to interrupt a presidential address to Congress. In 2022, Republican Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert repeatedly interrupted then-President Joe Biden's speech. Greene did it again during Biden's 2024 State of the Union address.\n\nOn Thursday, ten Democrats supported the censure resolution: Reps. Ami Bera of California, Ed Case of Hawaii, Jim Costa of California, Laura Gillen of New York , Jim Himes of Connecticut, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, Jared Moskowitz of Florida, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington and Tom Suozzi of New York.\n\nBut many Democrats criticized the resolution.\n\n\"That censure vote was outrageous to my mind,\" Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin told ABC News about Green's vote. \"What they've done is they've completely watered down the meaning of censure. Censuring people over heckling. Of course, now we'll have to start censuring Marjorie Taylor Greene, she repeatedly heckled President Biden.\"\n\n\"We know that we've seen Marjorie [Taylor Greene] yell at Joe Biden. There was no outrage. None. So there shouldn't be any outrage today,\" Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett said on ABC News Live.\n\nWhen asked about the 10 Democrats who supported the censure, Crockett said, \"I don't know their reason or their rational, but I know I voted the way that I did and at the end of the day if my district decides I need to go because I voted that way then so be it. But I stand with Al Green.\"\n\nMoments before the vote, Johnson had told ABC News he took \"no pleasure in making history like this\" and hoped Green would \"acknowledge his mistake.\"\n\n\"I want us to have proper decorum. I want us to maintain really the great tradition of this institution,\" Johnson said. \"And these things do damage to it and I'm sorry that it happened.\"\n\nGreen was ejected from the joint session on Tuesday after interrupting the president's speech and refusing to sit down despite warnings from Johnson. Green said multiple times he was not upset with Johnson for removing him or for overseeing the censure vote.\n\n\"He chose to deliberately violate House rules in a manner that we think is probably unprecedented in history -- interrupting a message of a president of the United States, who is an honored guest,\" Johnson explained ahead of the vote.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Read our full live blog below.\n\nAnd with that, we're calling a lid on one of the busiest primary nights of the year! Here's a recap of what went down.\n\nFirst, in the two highest-profile races of the night, controversial incumbents went 1-for-2:\n\n- In New York's 16th District , the AP has projected that Westchester County Executive George Latimer will defeat progressive Rep. Jamaal Bowman in the Democratic primary. This race was defined largely by internal Democratic divisions over the Israel-Hamas conflict and the influence of pro-Israel groups, although controversies about Bowman's past behavior certainly made him more vulnerable.\n\n- In Colorado's 4th District , the AP has projected that Rep. Lauren Boebert will win the GOP nomination. Boebert caused a lot of grumbling after switching districts from the 3rd, on the other side of the state, but she ultimately won easily thanks to her big fundraising advantage, Trump's endorsement and ton of name recognition.\n\nIt was a bad night for Trump-endorsed candidates in competitive races, three of whom lost:\n\n- The AP has projected that Air National Guard Lt. Col. Sheri Biggs will narrowly defeat Trump-endorsed pastor Mark Burns in the Republican runoff in South Carolina's 3rd District ..\n\n- According to the AP, Jeff Crank, a conservative talk radio host, won the Republican primary in Colorado's 5th District , defeating state party chair and Trump endorsee Dave Williams.\n\n-In the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Utah , Rep. John Curtis defeated Trump-endorsed Riverton Mayor Trent Staggs. Curtis will follow in the moderate footsteps of Sen. Mitt Romney, who is retiring from this seat.\n\nBoth parties also chose their nominees for some competitive House races this fall - and in general, they chose the more electable options.\n\n- The AP has projected attorney Jeff Hurd will win the Republican primary in Colorado's 3rd District . Republicans avoided nominating former state Rep. Ron Hanks, who was so conservative he risked losing this light-red seat to Democrat Adam Frisch.\n\n- The AP has projected that state Rep. Gabe Evans has won the Republican primary for Colorado's 8th District over state-party-endorsed Janak Joshi. Evans will face off in November against Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo, who won this district by just over 1,600 votes in 2022.\n\n- In New York's 1st District, former CNN anchor John Avlon won the Democratic primary against 2020 nominee Nancy Goroff. He'll face Republican Rep. Nick LaLota this fall.\n\n- In New York's 22nd District , the AP has projected that state Sen. John Mannion will win the Democratic primary against DeWitt Town Councilor Sarah Klee Hood. Mannion will face Republican Rep. Brandon Williams in this blue-leaning district in the general.\n\nHowever, conservative Republicans did score a win in one solid-red open seat:\n\n- In Utah's 3rd District, the AP has projected that state Sen. Mike Kennedy, who was endorsed by Sen. Mike Lee, will win the GOP nomination to succeed Curtis. Kennedy outpaced four other contenders, including trampoline tycoon Case Lawrence, who self-funded his bid but came in second place.\n\nFinally, a number of other incumbents also beat back notable challengers tonight:\n\n- The AP has projected that incumbent Gov. Spencer Cox will defeat state Rep. Phil Lyman in the Republican primary for Utah governor . However, Lyman, who was running to Cox's right, still took more than 40 percent of the vote.\n\n- Moderate Rep. Blake Moore also won renomination in Utah's 1st District , according to the AP, easily dispatching a more conservative challenger.\n\n- The AP has projected that Rep. Claudia Tenney will win the Republican primary in New York's 24th District over businessman Mario Fratto, who came within 14 points of unseating her in 2022.\n\n-G. Elliott Morris, Monica Potts, Nathaniel Rakich, Kaleigh Rogers and Geoffrey Skelley, 538; Meredith Conroy, 538 contributor; and Jacob Rubashkin, Inside Elections\n\nThere's only one unprojected race that we're still tracking: the Republican primary in Utah's 2nd District. The AP estimates that 83 percent of the final vote has been counted there, and Maloy is clinging to a 52 percent to 48 percent lead over Jenkins. However, it's getting late, so unfortunately I don't think we'll be sticking around for the bitter end for this one. (It's very possible we won't even get a projection tonight.)\n\n-Nathaniel Rakich, 538\n\nTonight I tracked several primaries in which women had a chance to win. On the Republican side, in the runoff in South Carolina's 3rd, Biggs's projected victory over the Trump-endorsed candidate should add a woman to the GOP conference in November given that district's rightward lean. In Colorado's 4th, another safe red district, it was likely a woman would win - we just weren't sure who - and Boebert ended up the winner there. However, we're still waiting to see whether Maloy will ward off her challenger to prevail in Utah's 2nd.\n\nAmong Democrats, nonincumbent women didn't have a remarkable night. In New York's 1st District, Goroff is projected to lose despite her support from the Democratic-aligned powerhouse EMILYs List. Also in New York, the AP has projected that Sarah Klee Hood will lose the primary in the 22nd. The only nonincumbent Democratic woman who prevailed tonight in a district winnable in November is probably Laura Gillen in New York's 4th District.\n\n-Meredith Conroy, 538 contributor\n\nBoebert easily won the Republican primary in Colorado's solidly red 4th District, making it almost certain she'll successfully switch over from the more competitive 3rd District and remain in Congress after the 2024 election. However, it's easy to wonder if she might've had more trouble against one notable opponent. With 89 percent of the expected vote reporting, per the AP, Boebert has 43 percent against five other candidates, four of whom have at least 10 percent. Had one of those candidates, especially one of the better-funded or well-known contenders with long-standing local ties (such as Sonnenberg) gotten a one-on-one crack at Boebert, perhaps she would have had more trouble. We'll never know, of course, and outside of states with runoffs or ranked-choice voting, a plurality win is all a candidate needs.\n\n-Geoffrey Skelley, 538\n\nIn Colorado, the state party organization is in a state of constant disarray , but they found the time to endorse a number of candidates in competitive GOP primaries tonight. Those candidates aren't doing particularly well: in the 3rd District, former state Rep. Ron Hanks is losing handily to attorney Jeff Hurd; in the 5th District, state party chairman Dave Williams lost to radio host Jeff Crank, and in the 8th District, former state Rep. Janak Joshi lost in a landslide to state Rep. Gabe Evans.\n\nWhile that's a poor track record for the state party itself, it's music to the ears of national Republicans who want to win House races. Hanks, Williams, and Joshi were poor fundraisers who had lots of baggage in their backgrounds and would have made holding onto even GOP-leaning seats more of a challenge. With all three losing tonight, national Republican groups can focus on the most competitive seat, the 8th District, and feel a lot better about the 3rd and 5th Districts.\n\n-Jacob Rubashkin, Inside Elections"

      "text": "Long before getting booted from Trump's speech, Rep. Al Green called for the president's impeachment\n\nGreen said \"there are times when it is better to stand alone.\"\n\nHe was the first Democrat to call for impeachment during President Donald Trump's first term in the White House and now Rep. Al Green is believed to be he first lawmaker in modern history to be thrown out of a joint session of Congress or a State of the Union address, according to a presidential historian.\n\nThe 78-year-old Texas congressman was escorted out of the House Chamber at the Capitol Building Tuesday night by the House sergeant at arms after he stood and shook his cane at Trump, and refused to obey House Speaker Mike Johnson's order to sit down and refrain from interrupting the president's speech by shouting criticisms.\n\n\"I can't think of another lawmaker being taken out. In modern history, I can say with some level of confidence that the answer is no,\" said presidential historian Mark Updegrove, CEO of the President Lyndon B. Johnson Foundation.\n\nIn advance of Trump's speech, members of the House Freedom Caucus called on the sergeant at arms to take action against any member of Congress who violated House rules during the address.\n\n\"The President's address to tonight's joint session of Congress is a constitutional obligation -- not a sideshow for Democrats to use noisemakers, make threats, throw things or otherwise disrupt,\" the Freedom Caucus said in a statement posted on social media. \"Our colleagues are on notice that the heckler's veto will not be tolerated. You will be censured. We expect the Sergeant at Arms and Capitol Police to take appropriate action against any Members of Congress or other persons violating House rules.\"\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the group of hardliners said they would censure Green, but moderate GOP Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington beat them to it. Newhouse formally introduced a measure on the House floor to censure Green, which is expected to be voted on Thursday.\n\nMembers of the Freedom Caucus include Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colorado.\n\nDuring President Joe Biden's State of the Union speeches between 2022 and 2024, Boebert and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, R-Georgia, heckled the former president. During Biden's 2023 State of the Union speech, Greene stood and yelled \"liar\" multiple times at the former president, but was not escorted out of the House Chamber.\n\nUpdegrove, an ABC News contributor, noted that Rep. Joe Wilson, R-South Carolina, yelled \"You Lie\" during former President Barack Obama's 2009 address to a joint session of Congress on health care. At the time, the House of Representatives, with the Democrats holding the majority, voted to reprimand Wilson, who later issued an apology to Obama.\n\n\"The Joe Wilson episode was kind of the introduction of greater hostility in Congress, at least in modern times,\" Updegrove said.\n\nAfter lashing out at Trump, yelling, \"You have no mandate to cut Medicaid,\" Green was removed from the chamber Tuesday night. He later told ABC News he'd welcome any consequences from his disruption, saying he was \"following the wishes of conscience.\"\n\n\"There are times when it is better to stand alone than not stand at all,\" Green said.\n\nGreen doubled down on his protest of Trump's speech on Wednesday, saying if given the chance, \"I would do it again.\"\n\n\"I am not angry with the speaker. I am not angry with the officers. I am not upset with the members who are going to bring the motions or resolutions to sanction. I will suffer the consequences,\" Green told ABC News.\n\nGreen added, \"What I did was from my heart. People are suffering. And I was talking about Medicaid. I didn't just say you didn't have a mandate. I said you don't have a mandate to cut Medicaid.\"\n\nGreen said he has not spoken to Democratic leadership about his Tuesday night outburst.\n\nIt's not the first time that Green, who has represented Texas' 9th congressional district since 2005, has been a thorn in Trump's side.\n\nIn May 2017, Green presented the first articles of impeachment against Trump, citing the firing of FBI Director James Comey. In July 2019, he called for Trump's impeachment again, citing the president's attack on four Democratic congresswomen of color. The house voted to table Green's resolution, effectively killing it.\n\nAnd just last month, Green announced on the floor of Congress that he intends to again file articles of impeachment against Trump, citing the president's suggestion that the United States take over the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"The movement to impeach the president has begun,\" Green said on the House floor. \"I rise to announce that I will bring articles of impeachment against the president for dastardly deeds proposed and dastardly deeds done.\"\n\nIn February 2024, Green, temporarily left his hospital bed in a wheelchair after undergoing intestinal surgery to vote against the Republican-led impeachment of Alejandro Mayorkas, then Biden's secretary of Homeland Security, over his handling of a crisis at the southern border. The house ended up voting 214-216 not to impeach Mayorkas.\n\n\"I wanted to do all that I can because I know Secretary Mayorkas. He's a good, decent man and I didn't want to see his reputation tarnished,\" Green said at the time.\n\nBorn and raised in New Orleans, Green moved to Houston, Texas, in the 1970s to attend the Thurgood Marshall School of Law, where he earned a law degree, according to a biography published on his website. He later founded and co-managed the law firm Green, Wilson, Dewberry, and Fitch.\n\nGreen also served as the Justice of the Peace for Harris County, Texas, for 26 years, retiring in 2004 to run for Congress. He also served for 10 years as president of the Houston branch of the NAACP.\n\nDuring his tenure in Congress, Green has focused on fair housing and fair hiring practices for the poor and minorities. While in Congress, he has served on the House Financial Services Committee and the Committee on Homeland Security, and chaired the House Oversight and Investigations subcommittee.\n\nOn his website, Green credits his family for teaching him \"righteous resistance to overcome persistent injustice.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "GOP reps encouraged to do town halls virtually rather than in-person after fiery meetings with constituents\n\nRep. Hudson said virtual forums allow them to have better control over events.\n\nRep. Richard Hudson, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, encouraged House Republicans to do more virtual events over in-person town halls, according to multiple sources familiar with the meeting.\n\nThe plea comes as multiple House Republicans have faced fiery constituents at recent in-person town halls concerning cuts to the federal workforce and the impact Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has had on communities.\n\nHudson told members that communicating with constituents via Facebook Live, tele-town halls and other virtual avenues would be more effective, allowing them to screen questions and have better control over the events.\n\n\"Chairman Hudson supports members reaching and helping as many of our constituents as possible, using technology makes this a heck of lot easier. Chairman Hudson opposes attention-seeking MoveOn and Indivisible activists hijacking these events,\" Will Kiley, NRCC's spokesman, told ABC News.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., claimed tele-town halls are \"more productive than if you just go to an open forum right now,\" accusing Democratic activists, without evidence, of showing up to in-person town halls to portray Republicans in a negative light.\n\n\"Look, these are their people who do this as a profession,\" Johnson said at the GOP press conference. \"They're professional protesters. So why would we give them a forum to do that right now? The best thing that our members can do is communicate directly, frequently, consistently, with their constituents, and there are other avenues to do it than just going in to try to give the other side sound bites.\"\n\nThis comes after President Donald Trump made accusations, without evidence, that \"paid troublemakers\" were interrupting GOP town halls, not constituents.\n\nOutside Tuesday's GOP conference meeting, Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., claimed she experienced safety concerns in her district, saying that virtual events were safer and more effective.\n\n\"I've done many tele-town halls, and I think those are very productive and we can reach 1,000s more people than we ever could in person,\" she said. \"And so, I think that that is a great strategy, but for me personally, it's just not safe to do an in person town hall because I don't know what to expect.\"\n\nMeanwhile, some Democrats said that if Republicans won't host town halls, they will.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said on Tuesday that he'd soon go out to red districts in his state to speak out against DOGE layoffs.\n\n\"Starting March 24th, I will be going to three red districts in California to speak out against DOGE's mass firings and the Republicans' Medicaid cuts,\" Khanna wrote in an op-ed in The Prospect published on Tuesday.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee, posted on X Tuesday morning that he'd host events in districts where Republican representatives won't meet constituents.\n\n\"If your Republican representative won't meet with you because their agenda is so unpopular, maybe a Democrat will,\" he said. \"Hell, maybe I will. If your congressman refuses to meet, I'll come host an event in their district to help local Democrats beat 'em.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "For GOP firebrand Rep. Lauren Boebert, anger and suspicion linger after Capitol riot\n\nSince Jan. 6, she's faced calls for expulsion and ridicule on social media.\n\nGun control advocate Eileen McCarron faced blowback last year when she quipped that newly elected Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert would be heading to Washington to lead the \"nut-job caucus.\"\n\nAfterward, McCarron said she wondered if she had gone too far. But then she saw Boebert rail about the 2020 elections, demand to carry a handgun onto the House floor, and send incendiary tweets about 1776 ahead of the U.S. Capitol violence on Jan. 6 . Now, McCarron told ABC News, she thinks Boebert \"may actually be worse\" than she feared.\n\n\"I think it's become clear she is a menace to our country,\" said McCarron, the president of Colorado Ceasefire.\n\nBoebert, 34, is just days into her first term as a member of Congress, and already the fast-talking, gun-toting tavern owner is proving to be a provocative and disruptive force -- a reputation she says she relishes.\n\n\"I know I am exactly where I am supposed to be for this moment,\" Boebert told ABC News. \"I'm proud to be here. I'm not slowing down. I'm not backing down.\"\n\nThe Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol served as a signal event for the Donald Trump presidency, and it has proven both defining and perilous for some of his staunchest supporters -- of which Boebert is one. In the weeks since the attack, Boebert has faced suspicion from many of her new colleagues in Washington. She has endured death threats and a flood of ridicule on social media. And she has seen strong reactions from critics and even some supporters back home in Colorado.\n\nSome of Boebert's Colorado constituents hosted a rally calling for her expulsion from Congress last week. Democrats promoted an aggressive recruiting drive to field an opponent to run against her in 2022. And a group of 60 elected officials from the Western Colorado region Boebert represents wrote an open letter to congressional leaders calling for an investigation into Boebert's conduct during the Jan. 6 insurrection, which they described as \"irresponsible and reprehensible.\"\n\n\"We have heard overwhelmingly from our constituents, therefore her constituents, that there is deep concern about her actions leading up to and during the protests that turned into a violent and deadly mob,\" the letter said.\n\nExactly what Boebert did leading up to and during the Capitol siege remains a subject of rumors, dispute and continued controversy.\n\nOn the morning of the siege, Boebert tweeted, \"Today is 1776.\" She was speaking on the House floor against certifying Arizona's election results as rioters swarmed the Capitol, saying \"The Constitution makes it necessary for me to object to this travesty.\" And as extremists poured into the Capitol, she tweeted: \"The Speaker has been removed from the chambers.\"\n\nSome of the most combustible claims leveled by her critics -- that she secretly gave reconnaissance tours of the Capitol to extremists, that her mother was a rioter, or that her tweet about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was intended to guide the mob -- appear to be entirely unsupported and have been met with sharp denials from Boebert herself.\n\n\"We are getting death threats over these slanderous claims,\" Boebert told ABC News. \"This is complete malice. They know that this is not true and they are still running with it.\"\n\nBut there are reasons that the otherwise obscure freshman congresswoman has remained a focus of attention both in Washington and at home.\n\nOne of the militants arrested for participating in the riot posted a photo online last week in which he posed in front of the restaurant Boebert owns in her hometown of Rifle, Colorado. Authorities said the man, Robert Gieswein, is aligned with a militia group known as the \"Three Percenters,\" which espouses anti-government and pro-gun views. The Southern Poverty Law Center says some members are dangerous \"anti-government extremists\" and the Anti-Defamation League has flagged members pushing white supremacist dogma .\n\nAnother image, taken at a pro-gun rally shortly after Boebert launched her campaign in 2019, showed her posing with local members of the Three Percenters, which was one of two organizations credited with providing security at the rally, according to published reports .\n\nPhotos of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol showed some participants waving the Three Percenters flag during the riot.\n\nIn June, Boebert tweeted the provocative statement: \"I am the militia.\"\n\nWhen asked about her views on anti-government militia groups, Boebert said their activity is sanctioned by the U.S. Constitution -- but she stopped short of offering a full-throated endorsement of their efforts. She said she doesn't know Robert Gieswein, the Colorado man who had posed in front of her restaurant and who was later charged with participating in the Capitol siege. She said the photos she has taken with Three Percenters should not be viewed as an endorsement of their actions.\n\n\"Lots of people attend my campaign events,\" she said. \"I'm not affiliated with any groups. Lots of people come out. Lots of people take photos with me. I'm not vetting every person that comes to my events.\"\n\nA recent FBI report notes that simply espousing anti-government rhetoric is not against the law, but that these types of militias represent a security threat because of their efforts to \"advance that ideology through force or violence,\" which is illegal.\n\nBoebert took to Twitter on Jan. 6 to condemn the attack on the Capitol, which has been proven to involve large numbers of militia members from around the country. And she refuted many of the claims circulated about her as false -- telling ABC News, for instance, that her mother did not participate in the siege and was locked in Boebert's office the entire time.\n\nDemocrats have continued to question whether any Republican members took steps to aid the rioters. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said on Thursday that \"if people did aid and abet, there will be more than just comments from colleagues here -- there will be prosecutions.\"\n\n\"We should have a full investigation,\" said Rep. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., adding that the conduct of members of Congress should \"absolutely\" be looked at by the FBI.\n\nBryson Morgan, a former investigative counsel to the House Office of Congressional Ethics, said nothing revealed so far would indicate that Boebert could face discipline.\n\n\"But we keep learning more and more about the events of Jan. 6,\" Morgan said. \"I would expect if a member was shown to be supporting an attack on the Capitol in any way, there would be swift action.\"\n\nGroups that monitor militia activity said they are increasingly concerned by what they have been learning about Boebert. Scott Levin, director of the Colorado chapter of the Anti-Defamation League, said his group has not been able to tie Boebert directly to any extremist or hate groups -- but he said the events of Jan. 6 generated heightened suspicion.\n\n\"The language she uses is something that people will take cues from, and that will empower them and embolden them to act,\" Levin said. \"And that's where the real danger is.\"\n\nBack in Colorado, people in Boebert's district have been following her first days in Congress with a range of reactions. Boebert said she has received positive feedback from her constituents.\n\n\"My supporters who sent me to Washington, D.C., are happy with me,\" she said. \"My base is growing.\"\n\nMatt Scherr, a commissioner in Eagle County, said Boebert is probably correct that her conduct is not likely to siphon away support -- even though he was upset by it. He said he does believe she needs to conduct herself with more care, now that she holds elective office.\n\n\"She is clearly passionate and a patriot,\" Scherr said. \"We were not calling for her resignation or for her to be expelled. But we would hope she learns from this and shows some contrition about what happened from the Capitol.\"\n\nOthers say they are increasingly concerned by what they see as combustible rhetoric.\n\n\"I know she has a lot of supporters,\" said John Clark, the mayor of the town of Ridgway in Boebert's district.\n\n\"I just know my friends and acquaintances aren't happy at all about what occurred on Jan. 6 and her ensuing behavior,\" Clark said. \"So many people are believing radical misinformation and it's really hard to convince them otherwise -- and unfortunately, Lauren Boebert is doing everything she can to spur them on.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Andy Biggs, Lauren Boebert, Michael Cloud, Eli Crane, Matt Gaetz , Bob Good, Diana Harshbarger, Anna Paulina Luna, Ralph Norman and Andy Ogles.\n\nGaetz and Boebert were seated in the front row, just behind Trump.\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside Manhattan's 100 Centre Street, the lawmakers took turns staunchly defending the former president and attacking witnesses and even the jury -- something Trump is barred from doing under the judge's gag order .\n\nA fired-up Gaetz went after Michael Cohen, who was on the witness stand, calling him a \"liar\" and suggesting the jury had a \"great appreciation\" for him. Gaetz also took aim at Judge Juan Merchan, describing him as \"corrupt.\"\n\n\"This is a made-up crime,\" Gaetz said. \"No other American in the country would be charged with this type of crime.\"\n\nGaetz is currently under investigation by the House Ethics Committee over allegations that include sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and potential public corruption, according to sources. The Florida Republican has denied all wrongdoing.\n\nTrump is facing felony charges related to a 2016 hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. He pleaded not guilty to a 34-count indictment charging him with falsifying business records in order to hide an alleged sexual encounter with Daniels from voters just before the 2016 election. He denies any wrongdoing.\n\nSome lawmakers also repeated Trump's statements labeling the case against him a concerted effort to keep him off the campaign trail or interfere in the 2024 election.\n\n\"This is a crooked, sham trial to try to hurt the nominee who is going to be the president of the United States whether or not they like it or whether or not they want that to happen,\" Rep.

And we are not going anywhere either. We are here to stand with him as he stands up for you, the American people.\"\n\nThe group's trip to New York came as Republicans on Capitol Hill moved to advance a contempt resolution against Attorney General Merrick Garland.

Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., announced Wednesday that she will switch congressional districts when she runs for reelection next year after barely eking out a victory in 2022.\n\nBoebert, a House hardliner who made a name for herself as a staunch advocate for gun owner rights, said in a video that she will be running in Colorado's 4th Congressional District rather than the 3rd Congressional District, which she currently represents. The 4th Congressional District is currently held by Rep. Ken Buck, a Republican who is retiring at the end of his current term. The district leans more Republican than the seat Boebert currently holds.\n\nIn a Facebook video, Boebert cast the move as a \"fresh start.\"\n\n\"I cannot put into words how grateful I am for everyone who has steadfastly stood alongside me over the past year and beyond. I am going to do everything in my power to represent the 3rd District well for the remainder of this term as I work to earn the trust of grassroots conservative voters in the 4th District to represent them in 2025,\" Boebert wrote in caption accompanying the video.\n\nStill, the Colorado Republican nodded to the headwinds she could face if she were to run for reelection in her current district and the implications for House Republicans' narrow majority if she were to lose.\n\n\"I will not allow dark money that is directed at destroying me personally to steal this seat. It's not fair to the 3rd District and the conservatives there who have fought so hard for our victories,\" she said.\n\nBoebert was already facing a credible primary challenger in the 3rd Congressional District in attorney Jeff Hurd, who had started racking up endorsements from prominent Republicans like former Gov. Bill Owens.\n\nThe move comes after she won reelection by about 500 votes against Adam Frisch, a Democrat who is running again in 2024 and has more than tripled her in fundraising so far this cycle.\n\nFrisch, responding to Boebert's announcement in a statement, said she was \"running scared\" from the 3rd Congressional District \"because she knows she can't match our campaign's ability to connect with voters and the hard work we have put in to provide them with a common sense voice in Congress.\"\n\n\"From Day 1 of this race, I have been squarely focused on defending rural Colorado's way of life, and offering common sense solutions to the problems facing the families of Colorado's 3rd Congressional District,\" he said. \"My focus will remain the same, and I look forward to bringing these issues with me to Congress in 2024.\"\n\nBoebert's self-styled reputation as a Christian conservative took a hit earlier this year after she was caught on video groping a date at a performance of the musical \"Beetlejuice\" in Denver. She has since apologized for the incident.\n\nHer move will place her in Colorado's most Republican district, which Buck won with over 60% of the vote in 2022. However, there is already a crowded field of Republicans running to replace Buck, and Boebert currently lives hundreds of miles from the 4th Congressional District, though she said she plans on moving.\n\nLegally, she can run in any district in Colorado as long as she lives in the state.\n\n-ABC News' Alexandra Hutzler contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "How Rep. Lauren Boebert's new district stacks up against her old one, in 4 charts\n\nUS Rep. Lauren Boebert's decision to switch congressional districts less than a year out from the 2024 election could be the key to preserving her political future. The firebrand is competing for the seat in a Whiter, wealthier and more Republican district - a recipe that could help keep the staunch conservative in Congress for another term.\n\nInstead of seeking reelection in the 3rd District, where she currently resides, Boebert set her sights on the 4th District, which is on the other side of the state. The move avoids a potentially challenging rematch with Democrat Adam Frisch, who out-fundraised her through the fall , and places Boebert in a district with demographics and politics more favorable to her election.\n\nHere's more on how the two districts compare.\n\nThe pivot from her current more moderate district to the new one is an attractive step for someone like Boebert, who has allied herself with the Donald Trump wing of the party and fought Rep. Kevin McCarthy's election as Speaker when Republicans took control of the House in 2023.\n\nThe 4th has a larger share of Republican voters and a 9.1 percentage point larger share of White residents compared to the 3rd, according to the Colorado Independent Redistricting Commissions.\n\nThe 4th District, anchored in Douglas County and encompassing the rural Eastern Plains, is also more affluent than Boebert's former district - or any other district in the state. Four percent of families in District 4 reported income below the poverty level, compared to 8.8% of families in District 3, according to the Census Bureau .\n\nIn the 2022 midterms, Boebert narrowly defeated Frisch with 546 votes in the tightest GOP House race of the year. In comparison, Republican Rep. Ken Buck - whose soon-to-be vacated seat Boebert is eyeing in the 4th - beat out his Democratic opponent by more than 86,000 votes, or 24.3 percentage points.\n\nWhile she will be running in the most conservative district in the state, Boebert still isn't guaranteed a win. The polarizing conservative has been embroiled in a series of scandals during her time in office, associating with the QAnon conspiracy movement and making anti-Muslim comments against fellow Rep. Ilhan Omar. Boebert faces a crowded primary Republican field in the 4th District, including a talk radio host and a member of the state legislature.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Lauren Boebert announced Wednesday that she will run in Colorado's 4th Congressional District in 2024 as Republicans look to keep their narrow House majority.\n\nAmong the most conservative members of the chamber, Boebert had been expected to face a tough reelection bid in Colorado's 3rd District in the Western part of the state.\n\n\"It's the right move for me personally, and it's the right decision for those who support our conservative movement,\" she said in her announcement video . \"Colorado's 4th District is hungry for an unapologetic defender of freedom with a proven track record of standing strong for conservative principles.\"\n\nThe eastern Colorado district is currently represented by Republican Rep. Ken Buck , who announced last month that he will not seek reelection.\n\nBoebert said she did not \"arrive at this decision easily\" and said she was driven by \"Hollywood elites and progressive money groups,\" whom she accused of \"buying\" the 3rd District seat.\n\nEarlier this year, Democrat Adam Frisch - who narrowly lost to Boebert in 2022's midterm elections - announced he would again mount a campaign to unseat her in 2024 .\n\nBoebert won her 2022 race by just 546 votes. Trump won the same district by about 8 percentage points in 2020, while he won the 4th District by about 19 percentage points.\n\nA staunch ally of Donald Trump, Boebert reiterated her support for the former president's White House bid in her announcement video. She listed putting \"a stop to Bidenomics\" as a key platform of her reelection campaign while blaming President Joe Biden for inflation.\n\nBoebert and Biden have been at odds several times, with Biden calling the congresswoman out during a recent visit to the 3rd District.\n\nDuring the visit last month , Biden touted provisions of his administration's Inflation Reduction Act, which he pledged would bring jobs to the local community, while issuing a blistering critique of Boebert, whom he described as \"one of the leaders of this extreme MAGA movement.\"\n\n\"She, along with every single Republican colleague, voted against the law that made these investments in jobs possible,\" Biden said. \"And then she voted to repeal key parts of this law, and she called this law a massive failure. You all know you're part of a massive failure? Tell that to the 850 Coloradans who got new jobs. ... It all sounds like a massive failure in thinking by the congresswoman and her colleagues.\"\n\nCNN's Ethan Cohen, Donald Judd and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

Lauren Boebert will win the Republican primary in Colorado's 4th Congressional District, CNN projects, after fleeing a stiff challenge in the district she has represented for two terms.\n\nBoebert, a MAGA firebrand who barely won reelection to the 3rd District in Colorado's Western Slope in 2022, announced in January that she would run for the open 4th District seat being vacated by Republican Ken Buck in the eastern part of the state.\n\nBuck, a fifth-term lawmaker and House Freedom Caucus member, resigned in March after lambasting his fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill for parroting former President Donald Trump's lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election.\n\nHis resignation triggered a special election to fill the remaining months of his term - though Boebert opted not to run in that election, which also took place Tuesday.\n\nRepublican Greg Lopez, the former mayor of Parker, will defeat Democrat Trisha Calvarese in the special election, CNN projects, and will serve through January. Lopez did not run in the regular primary, which drew six Republicans, including Boebert.\n\nBoebert first entered the national political consciousness in 2020 with her upset primary win over Republican Rep. Scott Tipton. She will be the heavy favorite to win a third term from her new district, which Trump would have carried by about 19 points in 2020 under its current lines. (The 3rd District, which she currently represents, also leans Republican, but Trump would have carried it by a narrower 8 points.)\n\nBoebert has faced accusations of carpetbagging since switching districts. She has said the decision to relocate was based on personal reasons - namely, wanting a fresh start following a messy and public divorce. She quickly established herself as the front-runner for the GOP nod in the 4th District after winning a Republican nominating assembly in April and with it, the top spot on the ballot.\n\nBoebert's decision to move avoided a repeat of her hard-fought 2022 race against Democrat Adam Frisch in what was the narrowest general election victory for a House Republican that year. Frisch is making a second bid for Congress and ran unopposed in the Democratic primary Tuesday.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros.

Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, whom she called \"black-hearted\" and \"evil,\" was a terrorist.\n\nIn those same remarks, she said that she felt safe around Omar because the Democrat wasn't wearing a backpack while they were in an elevator together.\n\nIt's another instance in which Boebert suggested Omar, who is Muslim and wears a hijab, was a terrorist. On Monday, the two lawmakers sent dueling statements about a phone call between the pair set up by Boebert after she apologized last week to \"to anyone in the Muslim community I offended,\" when similar comments surfaced on social media.\n\nThe video of Boebert's anti-Muslim comments, made in New York at a September Staten Island Conservative Party dinner, were posted on Facebook that month by an attendee running for borough president.\n\nRelated article Rep. Lauren Boebert suggested Rep. Ilhan Omar was terrorist in anti-Muslim remarks at event\n\n\"One of my I staffers, on his first day with me, got into an elevator in the Capitol.

Rashida Tlaib of Minnesota, another Muslim member of Congress.\n\n\"Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. These are just black-hearted evil women,\" Boebert said.\n\nBoebert's remarks were also posted on Twitter in September by Mike DeCillis , a New York Democratic congressional candidate. They received little attention outside of a local press write up , which noted she called her \"the jihad squad\" and a \"black-hearted evil\" woman.\n\nOn Monday, Boebert and Omar spoke on the phone, according to statements from both lawmakers.\n\n\"I have reflected on my previous remarks, now as a strong Christian woman who values faith deeply I never want anything I say to offend someone's religion,\" Boebert said in a video posted to Instagram . Boebert said Omar asked her to publicly apologize which she would not do and instead challenged Omar to issue an apology of her own for some of the comments she has made in the past.\n\nIn her statement, Omar said Boebert refused to apologize to her.\n\n\"Instead of apologizing for her Islamophobic comments and fabricated lies, Rep. Boebert refused to publicly acknowledge her hurtful and dangerous comments,\" she said. \"She instead doubled down on her rhetoric and I decided to end the unproductive call.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Omar called the elevator story \"a fabrication.\"\n\nIn her statement blasting Boebert on Monday, Omar said Boebert had \"a clear pattern for Islamophobic hate speech,\" and cited the local press write up of the September event and comments where Boebert called Omar \"a full-time propagandist for Hamas\" and she said Omar was an \"honorary member of Hamas\" and that we have \"terrorist sympathizers\" in Congress.\n\nOmar on Monday blasted Boebert's September comments in a message to CNN's KFile.\n\n\"It just gets worse,\" Omar told CNN. \"This is unhinged, and she continues to be emboldened by her party. This is their brand and it's dangerous.\"\n\nSimilar comments surfaced last week on social media when the Twitter account PatriotTakes, a left-wing group that researches right-wing extremism and is associated with the liberal PAC MeidasTouch posted a video of Boebert at an event in Colorado on Nov. 20.\n\nIn the since-removed video posted on Facebook from an event that day, Boebert implied Omar had been mistaken for a terrorist in an elevator on Capitol Hill.\n\nRelated article McCarthy should publicly condemn behavior by GOP members 'crossing the line' on violence and civility, Hutchinson says\n\n\"So the other night on the House floor was not my first jihad squad moment,\" Boebert told a crowd. \"I was getting into an elevator with one of my staffers and he and I were leaving the Capitol, we're going back to my office and we get in the elevator and I see a Capitol Police officer running hurriedly to the elevator. I see fret all over his face. And he's reaching. The door is shutting. I can't open it.\"\n\n\"What's happening? I look to my left and there she is, Ilhan Omar, and I said, 'Well she doesn't have a backpack, we should be fine,'\" Boebert continued.\n\nLast week, Boebert apologized to any offended in the Muslim community.\n\n\"I apologize to anyone in the Muslim community I offended with my comment about Rep Omar,\" Boebert said in a statement posted on Twitter. \"I have reached out to her office to speak with her directly. There are plenty of policy differences to focus on without this unnecessary distraction,\" she said\n\nOmar said the \"whole story\" was made up and condemned Boebert for her comments.\n\n\"Fact, this buffoon looks down when she sees me at the Capitol, this whole story is made up. Sad she thinks bigotry gets her clout,\" Omar tweeted on Thursday. \"Anti-Muslim bigotry isn't funny & shouldn't be normalized. Congress can't be a place where hateful and dangerous Muslims tropes get no condemnation.\"\n\nOn Friday, Omar called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to take action against Boebert.\n\n\"Normalizing this bigotry not only endangers my life but the lives of all Muslims,\" Omar said in another tweet. \"Anti-Muslim bigotry has no place in Congress.\"\n\nDemocratic leaders said Boebert should fully retract her comments, noting in a statement the congresswoman's \"language and behavior are far beneath the standard of integrity, dignity and decency with which the Constitution and our constituents require that we act in the House.\"\n\nMcCarthy said he spoke to Boebert on Friday in the wake of her comments and encouraged her to meet with Omar.\n\n\"She has apologized for what she said and has reached out to Congresswoman Omar to meet next week,\" McCarthy said in a statement. \"I spoke with Leader Hoyer today to help facilitate that meeting so that Congress can get back to talking to each other and working on the challenges facing the American people.\"\n\nMcCarthy's office did not respond to a request for comment on Boebert's September comments. Pelosi's office pointed to their weekend statement. Boebert and her staff did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

He faces felony counts of criminal possession of identification documents and conspiracy to commit a felony, as well as more than 15 additional misdemeanor and petty offenses, police said.\n\nBoebert, who recently switched to a neighboring congressional district that is solidly Republican to avoid a tough re-election bid in her previous district, cited family troubles as one of the reasons behind her decision to move.\n\nMegan Lebowitz is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., won her GOP primary Tuesday, NBC News projects, after she decided to run in a different district from the one where she narrowly won re-election in 2022.\n\nBoebert defeated five other Republicans for the party's nomination in Colorado's 4th District, which opened up after Rep. Ken Buck announced this year that he would resign. She will be heavily favored to win the seat in the general election given the area's rightward lean.\n\nBoebert, who is in her second term, eked out a 546-vote victory in the neighboring 3rd District two years ago and faced the prospect of a rematch with Adam Frisch, a well-funded Democrat. Former President Donald Trump won the 4th District by 19 points, while he carried the 3rd District by 8 points in 2020, according to calculations from Daily Kos Elections .\n\nBoebert, whom Trump backed, built a national profile as a conservative firebrand after she pulled off a surprising 2020 GOP primary win against then-Rep. Scott Tipton, in part by promising to take on high-profile liberal figures like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\n\"Since the first day I ran for public office I promised I would do whatever it takes to stop the socialists and communists from taking over our country,\" Boebert said in December when she announced her decision to run in the 4th District. \"That means staying in the fight. But it also means not allowing Hollywood elites and progressive money groups to buy the 3rd District.\"\n\nBoebert also said the move would be a \"fresh start\" after a difficult year for her personally, noting she and her husband had divorced. She was granted a temporary restraining order against her ex-husband in February. She also grabbed headlines last year for being escorted out of a musical for allegedly \"vaping, singing [and] causing a disturbance.\"\n\nBoebert's decision to run in the neighboring 4th District also shook up the GOP primary in the more competitive 3rd District, where Frisch, a former member of the Aspen City Council, cleared the Democratic field and won the party's nomination.\n\nAttorney Jeff Hurd won the GOP primary to face Frisch in the fall, NBC News projects, overcoming a Democratic effort to meddle in the Republican contest and secure an opponent who could be easier to beat in November.\n\nA Democratic outside group launched a TV ad appearing to boost controversial former state Rep. Ron Hanks, according to The Colorado Sun . Hanks has denied the 2020 election results, and he marched to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He also ran unsuccessfully in the GOP Senate primary in 2022.\n\nThe Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with House GOP leadership, countered the effort with its own TV ad targeting Hanks. Frisch also appeared to play in the primary by launching a TV ad aimed at Hurd, potentially damaging his standing among conservative voters by suggesting his positions on abortion and Trump are unclear.\n\nIn the deep-red 5th District, Republicans selected political consultant Jeff Cranks, a former radio host, to replace retiring GOP Rep. Doug Lamborn.\n\nCrank's victory is a blow to Trump, who had endorsed state GOP Chairman Dave Williams. Crank had support from House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana and a few other congressional Republicans.\n\nBoebert also decided not to run in the special election to serve out the rest of Buck's term, opting to remain in Congress and continue representing the 3rd District.\n\nRepublican George Lopez won the special election Tuesday to replace Buck, NBC News projects, meaning Lopez will soon head to the House and help pad Republicans' thin majority. Lopez did not run for a full term, so he will serve in Congress for only about six months.\n\nLopez, a former state director for the Small Business Administration and a former mayor of Parker, has run for office multiple times, including having made unsuccessful bids for governor in 2022 and 2018. He is a staunch conservative and has taken some far-right positions , including casting doubt on the 2020 election results. He also does not support any exceptions to a ban on abortions.\n\nTuesday's primaries also set the matchup in Colorado's 8th District, which is expected to be one of the most competitive House races in the country this year.\n\nAs expected, state Rep. Gave Evans won the GOP primary to take on Democratic Rep. Yadira Caraveo, who won her first term in 2022 by just 1 percentage point. Evans was the top fundraiser in the GOP primary and had Trump's endorsement.\n\nBridget Bowman is a national political reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Jayson Boebert was uncooperative when police responded at the restaurant, which led to charges of disorderly conduct, third-degree criminal trespass and obstructing a peace officer, according to court documents.\n\nJayson Boebert said he's just learning of the restraining order.

      "text": "Rep. Lauren Boebert won by only 546 votes last year. She isn't changing her ways.\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nWASHINGTON - Far-right Rep. Lauren Boebert eked out the narrowest of victories in Republican-friendly territory last fall, defeating Democrat Adam Frisch by only 546 votes and stunning political watchers who hadn't had the sleepy Colorado race on their radar.\n\nFrisch is now seeking a rematch - and Boebert, a conservative firebrand and culture warrior, hasn't moderated her policy positions or toned down her rhetoric in her second term on Capitol Hill. Instead, Boebert has been attracting national headlines for taking on President Joe Biden - and her own GOP leadership.\n\nIn January, she and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., nearly derailed GOP leader Kevin McCarthy's bid to become speaker in a dramatic standoff on the House floor. She accidentally missed the biggest vote of the year - a vote to raise the debt ceiling that she had opposed. Last month, she infuriated GOP leaders and colleagues by trying to force a floor vote on impeaching President Joe Biden over border issues before House investigations into him had wrapped up.\n\nNow, she's picking a fight over must-pass government funding and military policy bills, demanding they include right-wing policies to win her vote.\n\n\"A lot of Republicans have been bewildered by her,\" said Dick Wadhams, the former chairman of the Colorado Republican Party from 2007 to 2011. \"She has not changed her operating style, either substantively or just generally.\"\n\nOne House GOP lawmaker, who knows Boebert well, offered this advice: \"Her ass needs to get home to go campaign. Cut ribbons, go to bar mitzvahs and take credit for stuff she had absolutely nothing to do with.\"\n\nIn a part of Colorado that leans conservative but is accustomed to electing pragmatic Republicans and Democrats who tend to focus on local issues like water, natural resources and agriculture, Boebert stands out in the wrong ways to a segment of voters, Wadhams said.\n\n\"The perception, whether it's fair or not, is that Congresswoman Boebert has paid more attention to fighting these battles within the Republican Party than she has paid attention to the district,\" the former Colorado GOP leader said. \"Now, I'm sure her office would refute that. The trouble is it gets obscured by how she conducts herself. And that's what she's battling right now.\"\n\nAsked if she planned to change her approach this cycle, Boebert blamed her close call in 2022 on \"ballot harvesting\" - a GOP term for third-party collection of absentee ballots - rather than what Democrats have called her \"MAGA extremism\" and political charades.\n\n\"We need to get voter turnout. I think that all Republicans need to focus on ballot harvesting where it's legal in Colorado. And, I mean, that's something that we have to pay attention to or we're going to continue to be in the mess that we're in,\" Boebert said in an interview as she descended the Capitol steps. \"Democrats chase ballots while we're chasing voters. And so, I mean, we have to get in the game.\"\n\nBut Boebert also said she's focused on \"delivering\" for Colorado's sprawling 3rd District that includes rural areas, the cities of Grand Junction and Pueblo, and wealthy ski resorts around Aspen. While she didn't provide specifics - and her office didn't respond to a request for comment - some recent press releases have focused on local issues, like her water payments bill getting a hearing, her bill to remove the gray wolf from the endangered species list passing out of committee and securing a $5 million grant for a rural health center in a spending package she voted against.\n\n\"In the previous Congress, I wasn't able to do that as much because we were in the minority,\" she said. \"And we have a wonderful advantage of having this majority where I can actually deliver wins for my district.\"\n\nOnce the owner of the gun-themed restaurant Shooters Grill , Boebert, 36, has amassed millions of followers on social media, and a substantial platform outside Congress on conservative podcasts and TV shows, and at political conventions.\n\nDemocrats, and even some Republicans, say her rising national profile has eclipsed any purported local victories. Boebert has recently grabbed headlines after another conservative hero, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, called her colleague a \"little b----\" on the House floor - an altercation that led to Greene's ouster from the far-right Freedom Caucus. While Greene has now aligned herself with McCarthy, Boebert remains a thorn in his side.\n\n\"People want the circus to stop,\" said Frisch, accusing Boebert of pursuing \"all sorts of wild goose chases and causing all sorts of drama\" that don't matter to the district. \"She's one of these people that continues to love to get on Twitter and cable news networks and yell and scream.\"\n\n\"She's not focused on the district, she's focused on herself,\" he said. \"And we'll hammer her away on that.\"\n\nIn a phone interview, Frisch said he had needed just \"two more weeks with only gas station money\" to win the 2022 race. Now, he says, he'll have the time and resources he needs to close the deal. Frisch raised an eye-popping $2.6 million to Boebert's roughly $818,000 in the second quarter; he reported having $2.5 million cash on hand to Boebert's $1.4 million, according to campaign reports.\n\n\"She doesn't seem to be taking the job any more seriously than she was before. And again, that's bad for the district and bad for the country,\" Frisch said.\n\nHe promised that if he's elected his focus would be on local matters like water, rural health care, rural education, farming, ranching and natural resources.\n\nBut the Democrat still faces an uphill climb in the Republican-friendly district, which former President Donald Trump carried by 8 percentage points in 2020, according to data tracked by Daily Kos.\n\nBut Frisch, 55, said the 2022 result shows he appeals to nominal Republicans, including Trump voters, calling himself a \"very conservative Democrat running against an extremist.\" He wants to join the centrist Problem Solvers Caucus and be one of the five most bipartisan members of Congress. He said he disagrees with his party on energy policy, seeing a larger role for oil and gas alongside clean energy (although he said he'd have voted for the Inflation Reduction Act). And he wouldn't say whether he's supporting Biden's re-election bid in 2024.\n\n\"I share the concern that the majority of people have that it's a little disappointing that we're left with kind of a redo of 2020,\" he said. \"I'm laser-focused on what happens in CD-3.\"\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, however, is eager to paint Frisch, a former Aspen City Council member, as too liberal for the district.\n\n\"Adam Frisch is a liberal hack traveling around the district spreading lies like a snake oil salesman. Coloradans see through his act,\" said NRCC Regional Press Secretary Delanie Bomar.\n\nRep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a Frisch supporter this cycle and last, acknowledged that Boebert - with millions of social media followers on the right - can raise campaign cash off things like her Biden impeachment push. But he pointed out that Boebert voted no on Biden's bipartisan infrastructure law, which is expected to deliver billions in funding for the Centennial State and will be a major focus of Democratic campaigns next year.\n\n\"There are those who can monetize extremism, monetize selfish politics. And she might do that to some degree, but that only carries you so far when you're literally not submitting funding requests for roads and bridges and water infrastructure,\" Crow said. \"You can only hide that for so long. And clearly last cycle, the jig was up. The jig is even more up now.\"\n\nDemocrats will put a premium on knocking Boebert out of Congress, Wadhams warned, which could force the national GOP to spend money to step in and rescue her.\n\n\"She's become kind of a national symbol of what they want to beat,\" Wadhams said. \"It's just going to be a knock-down, drag-out fight between these two. It's not gonna be pretty. And it's gonna go down to the wire.\"\n\nScott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., lost his primary today to a moderate challenger who was backed by pro-Israel groups, NBC News projected, following a bitter and expensive race that exposed the party's divisions.\n\nThe race in New York's 16th District between Bowman and Westchester County Executive George Latimer drew more ad spending - $25 million, according to the ad tracking firm AdImpact - than any other House primary in history. Nearly $15 million of that spending came from the United Democracy Project, a super PAC linked to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, a powerful pro-Israel lobby, which backed Latimer.\n\nBowman, 48, one of Congress' fiercest critics of Israel, is the first incumbent Democratic lawmaker to lose a primary this election cycle and the first member of the \"squad\" of progressive lawmakers of color to be ousted from power since the group formed after the 2018 elections. Other squad members, including Reps. Ilham Omar, D-Minn., Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Summer Lee, D-Pa., have been targeted, but they survived primary challenges.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nBridget Bowman\n\nTrump's endorsement was on the line today in the GOP primary runoff in South Carolina's 3rd Congressional District, and his candidate came up short.\n\nTrump had endorsed pastor Mark Burns over nurse Sheri Biggs - both advanced to a runoff after none of the candidates vying to replace retiring GOP Rep. Jeff Duncan won a majority of the primary vote this month. Biggs, who also serves in the Air National Guard, ultimately won the GOP nomination, The Associated Press projects.\n\nIn the two weeks since the primary, a group called Conservatives for American Excellence spent more than $400,000 attacking Burns, launching an ad that cited media reports that he lied about having served in the military and had supported Democrats in the past. The group is funded by major GOP donors, including Ken Griffin, Paul Singer and Warren Stephens.\n\nJake Traylor\n\nZoë Richards\n\nIn an interview published this week, Trump appeared to acknowledge that he interrupted Biden too much in their first presidential debate in 2020.\n\nTrump was asked by the Washington Examiner about his debate performance during the 2020 cycle and whether he agreed that he interrupted Biden \"too much.\"\n\nAfter he appeared to acknowledge the interruptions, Trump said that \"I was very aggressive in the first one\" but contended that the interruptions were tied to Biden's making false claims.\n\n\"I agree, though. The second debate I handled it much differently and got very good marks,\" Trump said.\n\nHe also criticized the rules and limits of the debate, saying he doesn't like how he'll be debating in any empty room and not be able to feel an audience's real-time reaction.\n\nBridget Bowman\n\nRep.

We have a great bench, and even beyond that, we have a great bench, and we'll make a decision fairly soon.\"\n\nNBC News reported this afternoon that the Trump campaign is considering announcing his running mate this week.\n\nTrump said this week that he had made up his mind about who his pick would be but had yet to tell anyone whom he has chosen.

He starts with nonsense and then digresses into blather. This has gotten only worse in the years since we debated.\"\n\nClinton debated Biden during the 2008 presidential primaries, a contest they both lost to Barack Obama. Clinton faced off against Trump in debates three times before he scored an upset victory in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nShe said people who tune in to Thursday's debate should \"pay attention to how the candidates talk about people, not just policies,\" \"try to see through the bluster and focus on the fundamentals at stake\" and \"think about the real choice in this election.\"\n\n\"This election is between a convicted criminal out for revenge and a president who delivers results for the American people,\" Clinton wrote in closing. \"No matter what happens in the debate, that's an easy choice.\"\n\nAbigail Brooks Abigail Brooks is a producer for NBC News.\n\nDasha Burns\n\nReporting from Erie, Pennsylvania\n\nERIE, Pa. - Richard Speicher and Mary Gensheimer are lifelong Republicans and lifelong residents of Erie County. A yard sign that was, until recently, on the front lawn of their suburban home displayed the political homelessness they feel in their party and their community.\n\nThe couple had put up a \"Republican voters against Trump\" sign, only to find it missing one evening when they returned from dinner. Speicher and Gensheimer say they aren't sure whether it was a prank or whether a neighbor was sending a message about their political views. Regardless, they decided to send a message of their own in Pennsylvania's primary this spring, voting for Nikki Haley - even though she had dropped out of the race weeks before.\n\n\"Trump is not a representative candidate of the Republican Party. He might be what they represent now, but as lifelong Republicans, we both come from a much different tradition,\" Speicher said. \"The only choice available was Nikki Haley.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nTrump could announce his running mate choice as early as this week and possibly before Thursday's first debate with Biden, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nAli Vitali\n\nAlex Rhoades\n\nReporting from Mount Vernon, New York\n\nMOUNT VERNON, N.Y. - A fiery Bowman just stopped by a polling place, where he was greeted by supporters and a marching band.\n\nAsked by NBC News about why voters have been skittish to speak publicly about how they voted and about how intense this campaign has gotten, Bowman pointed the finger at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee .\n\n\"It's intense because AIPAC are bullies ... and my opponent has sided not just with AIPAC but with Republican billionaires. And because [Latimer's] been in office so long,\" he said, \"people are afraid.\"\n\nAsked whether he would commit not to run as a candidate with the Working Families Party if he loses his Democratic primary today, Bowman sidestepped the question.\n\n\"We're winning, brother! We are winning,\" he responded.\n\nLatimer has repeatedly said that if he loses the primary, he will not continue his bid for Congress.\n\nJane C. Timm\n\nTrump's campaign vowed legal action and said it would seek a criminal investigation into a super PAC that ran a misleading digital ad in Pennsylvania featuring clips of him discouraging Republicans from voting by mail.\n\nAfter having condemned mail voting for years, Trump is now embracing it and encouraging his voters to take advantage of the practice in the presidential election.\n\n\"MAGA Patriots, listen to our president,\" the ad from Pennsylvania Values PAC begins before it splices together sound bites of Trump condemning mail voting.\n\n\"Mail-in voting is totally corrupt, get that through your head,\" Trump says in one such clip.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nAlex Tabet\n\nReporting from Phoenix\n\nPHOENIX - Maricopa County officials today provided new details at a news conference about the alleged theft of a key and a fob from an election ballot facility last week.\n\nWalter Ringfield Jr. - 27, a temporary election worker - was arrested Friday and accused of stealing keys and a security fob from the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center on Thursday.

But in that short time, he has already separated himself as the most consistently MAGA-aligned of the three GOP senators on Trump's shortlist for a running mate.\n\nVance, an Ohio Republican, has distinguished himself as a harsh critic of American engagement in foreign conflicts and as a populist on most domestic issues. When he splits from the other senators Trump is eyeballing for his ticket - Marco Rubio of Florida and Tim Scott of South Carolina - it is often by embracing GOP base positions at the expense of establishment priorities such as funding government operations, according to an NBC News analysis of their voting records compiled by Congressional Quarterly.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nKatherine Koretski\n\nZoë Richards\n\nAfter he fail ed to qualify for Thursday's presidential debate, independent Robert F.

After she asked him to address a defense argument that the search warrant application misrepresented when the FBI investigation began, Harbach called it a \"conspiratorial theory\" and challenged the premise of the question. \"Don't put words in my mouth,\" Cannon interjected.\n\nHarbach apologized and said his issue was with the defense's argument, not the judge.

It features a woman named Sarah who runs her own tech company and tells viewers: \"Foreign competitors like China want to surpass America in AI. Our leaders need to protect America's competitive edge.\"\n\nThe ad comes as lawmakers in Washington have increasingly begun to scrutinize tech and AI companies in the last few years. Just last year, Biden issued an executive order promoting the safe and responsible development of AI.\n\n\"We must not overlook the threats posed by China and other foreign adversaries aiming to surpass us. That is why U.S. policymakers must strengthen domestic innovation and preserve our competitive edge in these vital technologies. The stakes are too high for us to get it wrong,\" American Edge Project CEO Doug Kelly said in a statement announcing the ad.\n\nElleiana Green Elleiana Green is a Digital Politics intern with NBC News\n\nTrump will be interviewed by his 2016 campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, on Newsmax at 8 p.m., Lewandowski announced in a post on X.\n\nThe interview will take place just hours after the New York judge in Trump's hush money case lifted parts of a gag order that prevented the former president from speaking about the witnesses and jurors at the trial.

Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, and Byron Donalds, R-Fla., the campaign said.\n\nThe event, at 1 p.m. tomorrow, comes as Trump has tried to make inroads with the Black voters in battleground states . Trump and Biden will debate on Thursday night.\n\n\"Joe Biden's failed economy has left Black Americans behind, burdened with higher prices and lower wages,\" the campaign said in a release, adding that Trump would \"ease the financial pressures placed on Black American households.\"\n\nOwen Hayes\n\nJake Traylor\n\nDareh Gregorian\n\nTrump's attorneys are back before U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon today for a third day of hearings in the former president's criminal case involving classified documents.\n\nThe hearing focuses on Trump's motion to exclude evidence obtained during the Mar-a-Lago search and from his former attorney, Evan Corcoran. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., had allowed prosecutors to question Corcoran despite attorney-client privilege because of the so-called crime-fraud exception.\n\nCannon said in an order that the first part of the hearing would be held in a sealed session to \"protect material to which grand jury secrecy applies and/or as to which Defendant Trump asserts attorney-client privilege.\" It will then resume in public around 1 p.m. \"or as soon as otherwise practicable,\" the order said.\n\nCannon held separate hearings Friday and yesterday on Trump's motion arguing Jack Smith's appointment as special counsel in the case was improper and on Smith's request to modify the conditions of Trump's release to bar him from making false statements about the FBI agents who searched his property.\n\nShe has not ruled on either issue.\n\nDasha Burns\n\nElleiana Green Elleiana Green is a Digital Politics intern with NBC News\n\nTrump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended her criticisms of the moderators for Thursday night's presidential debate on CNN after the network cut her off during a combative interview yesterday.\n\n\"I was not attacking the moderators,\" Leavitt told NBC News when asked whether her criticisms would set up an excuse if the debate doesn't go Trump's way. \"What I was doing was pointing out their very long history of anti-Trump statements.\"\n\nBeing cut off during the interview just \"proves our point that President Trump is knowingly going into a hostile environment on Thursday, but that's OK. He's ready and willing to do it because he believes so strongly in his message, \" she said.\n\nAsked whether Trump and the campaign also were backtracking from their efforts to paint Biden as suffering from cognitive decline, raising expectations for his performance in recent days out of concern they might have set too low a bar for what would constitute a successful debate for him, Leavitt said, \"No, I think two things can be true at the same time.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden, at the end of the day, is still a career politician who has been doing this for decades,\" she said.\n\nWith just days to go before the first Biden-Trump debate, the campaigns are preparing differently. Biden prepared with advisers at Camp David, while Trump was holding campaign events and said he has chosen a running mate. NBC News' Gabe Gutierrez reports.\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nBiden and first lady Jill Biden will hold a post-debate campaign rally Friday at 12 p.m. in Raleigh, N.C., the campaign announced.\n\nDaniel Barnes is reporting from the federal courthouse.\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nProsecutors from special counsel Jack Smith's office said in a new filing yesterday that Trump's latest effort to dismiss his classified documents case should be denied without holding a hearing on the matter.\n\nThe filing included some new photos of the boxes seized during the search of Mar-a-Lago in 2022. They included a photo Walt Nauta took of spilled boxes in a storage room, examples of classified documents photographed next to boxes they were found in and a photo of a leather-bound box retrieved from a closet in Trump's office.\n\nThis filing comes in response to Trump's latest push to get the case dropped - an argument by his lawyers that the FBI failed to properly maintain the exact order of the materials inside the boxes at the moment they were seized, thereby destroying potentially exculpatory evidence.\n\nIf classified materials were buried in the boxes or filed next to other items that predated Trump leaving office, that would support an argument that Trump did not know the documents were in the boxes and he did not \"willfully\" retain them, Trump's lawyers argued.\n\nBut prosecutors said in last night's filing that that argument doesn't hold up, in part because Trump was personally involved in the packing of the boxes and had personally gone through them more than once since leaving the White House.\n\nKelly O'Donnell\n\nGabe Gutierrez\n\nAmong Biden supporters, there was concern yesterday after CNN's political director, David Chalian, was quoted in The New York Times saying that Thursday's debate \"is not the ideal arena for live fact-checking.\"\n\nDemocrats are now increasingly calling for the moderators to take an active role in calling out any false statements Trump makes.\n\n\"Trump has been known to steamroll moderators and make false claims on the debate stage, and when he lies, there is a responsibility to call it out,\" said Jim Messina, a Democratic strategist and then-President Barack Obama's campaign manager when he won re-election.\n\n\"In 2012, there was a controversial moment where the debate moderator challenged a false claim from [GOP nominee Mitt] Romney, and it hurt Romney with voters. Despite the tectonic shift in politics since then brought about by Donald Trump and MAGA extremism, it is still journalists' responsibility to call out blatant lies,\" Messina said.\n\nKelly O'Donnell\n\nGabe Gutierrez\n\nVarious officials are moving from the White House to Camp David depending on their primary roles, according to a source familiar with the preparations.\n\nWhite House deputy chief of staff Bruce Reed has been leading the policy portion of the debate prep, highlighting the administration's accomplishments and its agenda.\n\nAides are working in rotation with the president. Some advisers are connecting by Zoom, as well. Former National Economic Council Director Brian Deese is also involved.\n\nThe process was described as \"going well and will continue for the coming days.\"\n\nThe source said Camp David provides a different kind of environment to juggle presidential duties and preparation for Thursday.\n\nThe president is also having his regular briefings on national security and daily topic issues, such as the extreme weather, heat and flooding.\n\nScott Wong\n\nBen Kamisar\n\nBridget Bowman\n\nAfter House Republicans have been facing competitive primaries for weeks, it's now a Democrat who could be in trouble today.\n\nThe primary in New York's 16th District has attracted the most ad spending ever for a House primary, with Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman - a member of the progressive \"squad\" and a fierce Israel critic - facing scores of attacks.\n\nThe historic spending, according to the ad tracking firm AdImpact, includes $14.8 million in ads from United Democracy Project, a super PAC tied to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.\n\nPro-Israel groups are backing Bowman's opponent, Westchester County Executive George Latimer, a centrist who has served in local politics for decades and is an unabashed supporter of Israel.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nKelly O'Donnell\n\nGabe Gutierrez\n\nSeveral officials familiar with the debate preparations are incredulous that Trump is mocking Biden for prepping at Camp David.\n\n\"He's sleeping now,\" Trump said at a rally Saturday. \"Because they want to get him good and strong.\"\n\nOne source pointed out that Biden traveled to Europe twice over two weeks for international meetings, going straight from the G7 Summit in Italy to a high-profile fundraising event in Los Angeles. The source added that Trump wasn't as active on the campaign trail as Biden was during the former president's hush money trial in Manhattan this spring.\n\nSahil Kapur\n\nIn six weeks, Trump has gone from mocking Biden as a feckless debater who can barely speak to praising his talents ahead of their first debate in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"Crooked Joe Biden is the WORST debater I have ever faced - He can't put two sentences together!\" Trump wrote on his social media platform May 15. Two days later, he said in a speech to the Minnesota GOP: \"He can't talk. He can't walk. Can't find his way off a stage. Can't put two sentences together.\"\n\nBut lately, ahead of the debate Thursday in Atlanta, Trump is singing a different tune, saying he has watched Biden's vice presidential debate from 2012 and appreciated his rival's abilities.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Read it now .\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. isnât backing down after calling Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo. a âlittle bitchâ to her face on the House floor Wednesday during a fight over their dueling efforts to impeach President Joe Biden.\n\nAsked whether there was any chance the two would reconcile after the confrontation, Greene said: âAbsolutely not.â\n\nâShe has genuinely been a nasty little bitch to me,â Greene told Semafor. (Their fight was first reported by The Daily Beast.)\n\nGreene acknowledged that the feud between the two hard-right stars has been sizzling since the last Congress. She said Wednesdayâs explosive fight began over public comments she made earlier that day, effectively accusing Boebert of trying to hijack her own efforts to impeach the president.\n\nGreene introduced impeachment articles against Biden as early as January 2021 and then again this May . Boebert put forward her own impeachment articles more recently but has been trying to force an immediate vote on them by turning them into a so-called âprivileged resolutionâ that can go straight to the floor.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Wednesday morning, Greene said that Boebert had âbasically copied my articles,â then tried to leapfrog her. Later in the afternoon, she says Boebert confronted her about what sheâd said to the press.\n\nâI was sitting down, and so I stood up and I said, âIâm happy to clarify my public statements to your face,ââ she told Semafor. âI told her exactly what I think about her.â\n\nGreene said she told Boebert she was upset that the Colorado lawmaker had decided to imitate rather than support her own impeachment effort.\n\nâItâs purely for fundraising,â she told Semafor. âItâs throwing out red meat so that people will donate to her campaign because sheâs coming up on the end of the month, and sheâs trying to produce good fundraising numbers.â\n\nGreene said that at one point in the fight, parts of which were caught from afar on video, Boebert accused the Georgia lawmaker of accidentally spitting on her lip. Then, toward the end of the exchange, Boebert tried to re-engage her, but she cut the conversation off. âI said âyou need to shut up because the only person thatâs recognized to speak right now is Luna,ââ she told Semafor, referring to Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., who was then giving a speech on the floor.\n\nBoebert did not respond to a request for comment. Her impeachment drive suffered a setback Wednesday, however, when House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told reporters he would refer her resolution to the House Judiciary Committee, meaning it wonât see an immediate vote.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Read it now .\n\nI met Adam Frisch in the Spring of 2022 and found him to be extremely gracious and yet determined. Sort of a really nice but unstoppable honey badger. He told me he was planning to run in the Democratic primary and, if successful, wanted to challenge and beat one of the Houseâs most flamboyant MAGA idols, Rep. Lauren Boebert, whom he thought was achieving nothing but embarrassment for her district.\n\nHe was a businessman, policy wonk, long distance skier, doing the kind of ski trekking where you have to go up the mountains as much as down them. He seems to care a great deal about good public policy and has Republican and Democrat friends who also care about policy and spend time talking about real issues with him in fancy haunts around Aspen.\n\nI knew in my gut he would succeed in winning the primary and give her a very tough race, but almost no one else in the political world gave him any attention or support â though he did get an endorsement from Andrew Yangâs Forward Party. Itâs a great story of what it takes to overcome inertia.\n\nWith 99% of the vote counted, Frisch leads Boebert by 64 votes. Under Colorado law, thatâs less than a 0.5% difference given the total vote counts and thus there will be a recount if it holds.\n\nHere is my exchange with Frisch, edited for length and clarity, on why and how he took on an incumbent that few saw as beatable.\n\nSTEVE CLEMONS:Â  So unpack it for us. How did you do this? This was a race that I knew from knowing you was going to be hot, but most other people said there werenât going to be any surprises there.\n\nADAM FRISCH: Â  After nine months, people are starting to finally return my phone calls. So I think you and I met up in the springtime this year.Â A year ago, Rep. Boebert made some comments. Donât ask me what the exact words were but they were not helpful and they were disrespectful. And sheâs said a lot worse. And Iâm just thinking, âOh my goodness. Not good.â\n\nAnd at that time, Iâm thinking, let me pull up some numbers and see if thereâs any way she or others can lose.Â  And, you know, you have these five or six people in the Squad on the left, and you have eight or nine or ten on the right. And you put them all together, and I donât want to make any moral equivalency here, but there are 15 or so of those brand name loud ones on either side, and 14 of them have 65% to 80% wins in 2020 in the general election.\n\nBut Boebert was at 51%. I realized, oh my goodness, she won 51% to 46%. And if only 5% of the voters switched their vote in 2020, she would have lost. On top of that, she didnât even win her home county. Those who know her best donât care for her, and a lot more people know more now than they did in 2020 and not for good reason. And so that was one data point.\n\nShe would have had about 54% of the vote in 2020 if she had the district where we ran. The district went from R-5 to R-8 or R-9. Donald Trump in 2016 won these 27 counties by over 15 points. So what in the world was I doing?!\n\nMy math was, instead of needing 5%, we needed 10% of her prior voters. And Iâm like, I bet you more than 10% of her prior voters are frustrated with her. I think 40% nationally of the Republican Party wants their party back.\n\nI ran into this guy, Joel Searby from the Renew America Movement. I saw that he was launching a variety of anti-Trump Republican organizations. And then on November 30th of last year, the conservative newspaper Delta, which is the Western Slope, the heart of Trump country, wrote an anti-Boebert editorial along the lines of âwe supported her at the start but sheâs been an embarrassment.â\n\nI started to see some tea leaves that maybe the Trumpism is starting to go down. But for better or worse, the only place in the entire country where thereâs any mathematical chance to see one of these extremists defeated is Colorado-3. And I knew that somehow thereâs a way to make this an emotional win for the country and send a message of enough of the hate, enough of the yelling and screaming.\n\nAnd so I did some math. I am asking if someone can get 10% of her prior voters, can you get a little buffer, because sheâs probably going to get a bunch of undervoting. And I think the statistics will show that she accumulated a lot fewer votes than in her own district, than the local state House representative, or Joe OâDea who ran a fairly good Senate race against Michael Bennett, but came up pretty short.\n\nAnd Iâm like, youâre gonna need a moderate pragmatic Democrat. And if that person can get by the Democratic Party primary, which wonât be easy â and it wasnât, I won by 290 votes out of 50,000.Â  The Democratic primary voters are not looking for a pro business, pro domestic energy. moderate person who wants to go join the Problem Solvers Caucus, which I talked about. I made it very clear in the primary. And they certainly didnât want it to be from a guy from the mountaintops. And they certainly didnât want a guy from Aspen. I had to own that. I appreciate a lot of people are not looking for a fairly successful, middle-aged, straight white guy to lead the Democratic party going forward.\n\nAnd so I won in spite of all that.Â  I won because I worked very, very hard. I drove 10,000 miles. And I made a case â I said the district has 25% D, 31% R and 43% unaffiliateds. No matter what you want to do in the Democratic Party, thereâs not enough Dâs in the district to win. I just implore you to invest your vote in someone who can build a coalition. And I think I can build that coalition.\n\nSTEVE CLEMONS: Youâre sort of describing yourself as a kind of Joe Manchin of Colorado. Do you expect that to be welcomed by your fellow members in the Democratic caucus, or would they give you a tough time like they do him?\n\nADAM FRISCH: People are pushing me like, âI donât want you to be a Joe Manchin,â or âAre you going to be like Joe Manchin?â but said derisively. But Iâm like, listen, Iâm going to be my own person, but I think we need to realize Colorado-3 are ranchers and farmers. Itâs 25% Dems. And we have a unique opportunity to get rid of an extremist and try to build a coalition.\n\nAnd so Iâm not going to attach myself to AOC, Nancy Pelosi, [Arizona Senator Kyrsten] Sinema, or Manchin. I am a Western Slope Democrat, who is going to be more conservative. And I tell people I lived in Boulder for four years, I lived on the Upper West Side for six years, I grew up in Minneapolis. I appreciate the more progressive liberal scene, but thatâs not going to fly here. And I convinced some, almost not enough, but enough people to kind of do that.\n\nAs a side note, when Joe Manchin â and I would say, correctly â pushed back against President Bidenâs comment [about coal] in California last week, I was having a 40 minute interview with a Republican organization that represents 22 counties in southern Colorado. And my first talk to them as an introductory podcast, they were blown away about my pro-domestic energy views that Iâve had for a long time. My belief is, as long as we are begging Saudi Arabia for help, we might want to have a different energy policy than if weâre not begging Saudi Arabia for help.\n\nSo thereâs a lot of hard things about running. But one of the easy things to run for me was what I believed as a father, as a small business owner, and that is exactly what I laid out very clearly to the Democratic primary voter. They knew what my demographic is, but I made it very clear. Iâm not the progressive in this race. I am a pro-business pro-domestic energy, Democrat that can build the coalition needed. And my mandate is to defeat Lauren Boebert. And I want to have those conversations.\n\nA couple things that resonated with the non-Dâs. For 20 years, I would say that if there was a âget stuff doneâ party, I would be in that party, but that party is not doing very well right now. And our country is suffering for that. I think our district is especially suffering for that because of who our representative is.\n\nTwo, people want the circus to stop. That was probably the best five or six words that I used all the time. And again, it resonated with everybody on the right and the left and the center.\n\nAnd then I have this buddy I went to middle school and high school with Dean Phillips, D-Minn. who is in the Congress, and heâs in the Problem Solvers Caucus.Â  Dean used this term âAngertainmentâ about a year ago on some little newscast.\n\nAnd Iâm like, Oh, my goodness, that is exactly the best definition of where the sad part of our political parties are on either side â getting people angry, turning it into entertainment, generating money, generating media off of it. And our district is represented by the Queen of Angertainment, along with Marjorie Taylor Greene. When I talked about wanting this âangertainment industryâ to stop, that resonated with a lot of people.\n\nAnd so with all these messages, I wanted people to know who I was and that I was trying to get across that Iâm a no-nonsense, get stuff done, pragmatic, moderate, accomplished, consensus builder. And I talked about the Problem Solvers Caucus 50 times a day. And I would say that about 80% of the people had no idea what I was talking about. But when I started talking about this caucus that has 29 Dâs and 29 Râs, people got very, very excited.\n\nThis came off as pretty authentic because I believe in all this stuff. And again, I go back to, oh, my goodness, I wish there were other opportunities to see someone like Boebert defeated. But I think this is the only place in the entire country to see an emotional win.\n\nSo, I called the DCCC â they never called me back. But I reached out to everyone among the donors, and I called the politicos and elected officials and everyoneâs like, hey, great for you, but thereâs no chance in hell. They said in conversations that maybe in 2024 or 2026, you can make a goal of it. Get your name out there. And Iâm like, Oh my goodness, Iâm trying to focus on now because I think thereâs a huge opportunity. If you wait too long, her schtick will get baked into normalcy. And it wonât be as shocking and God forbid her verbal actions become normal to a lot of people.\n\nSo we started down seven points in July. We should have started down about 10. But, I knew that she was going to have some negatives. And then we worked very, very, very hard. I think we ran one of the best campaigns in the entire country. Great team, and we stuck on message. And about a month ago, we had a good poll that showed us down 2 points within the margin of error. And when that came out, that generated a chunk of money, and some of our first media exposure where people started to say, oh, thatâs quite okay.\n\nAnd you saw what happened last night. We know there was a message sent, and I spent a lot of time working on Republicans and Democrats. We launched the Republicans for Frisch website. We had some testimonials on there. We started to hear from people and things started to come together.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Your guide to everyone Republicans want to impeach\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nAs most of the Internet is now aware, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. cursed out Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo. on the House floor this week during a fight over their competing efforts to impeach President Joe Biden. Some readers may have been taken aback by the collapse of Congressional decorum. But others may have been more surprised by the fact that, yes, there are already dueling efforts to impeach the president.\n\nFor the perplexed, hereâs a quick guide to all the various impeachment efforts currently aimed at Biden, as well as those targeting four other administration officials.\n\nIn this article:\n\nFour Republican members have introduced separate impeachment resolutions against Biden, including Reps. Greene , Boebert , Bill Posey , R-Fla. and Andy Ogles , R-Tenn. All of them center around Bidenâs handling of the border. However, Ogles has added language pointing to the uncorroborated allegations that Biden and his family were involved in a bribery scheme that Republicans have recently seized on.\n\nGreene was the first to file a resolution and has accused Boebert of essentially copying and trying to hop over her effort.\n\nFour Republican members of Congress have filed impeachment resolutions against Mayorkas. All of them center around the influx of migrant people illegally entering the U.S.-Mexico border. Reps. Greene , R-Colo., Clay Higgins , R-La., Pat Fallon , R-Texas and Andy Biggs , R-Ariz.\n\nGreeneâs impeachment resolution against Garland includes a litany of Republican qualms about the DOJ. As she summed it up: âMerrick Garland has weaponized the Department of Justice against Americans in many different ways, all kinds of every level: from January 6th people that walked through the Capitol to parents holding their school boards accountable to pro-life Catholics, and it goes on and on to President Trump with the documentâs case. Itâs outrageous.â\n\nGreene also introduced articles of impeachment against Wray, a favorite target of former president Donald Trump, accusing him of âfacilitating the development of a Federal police force to intimidate, harass, and entrap American citizens that are deemed enemies of the Biden regime.â\n\nThe list of accusations is long and includes some familiar conservative complaints over issues like Hunter Bidenâs laptop and the FBI raid of Mar-a-Lago, as well as less well-known ones, such as that the Bureau had a plan to spy on traditionalist Catholic groups believed to be tied to white supremacists. Wray âhas spit in the face of Republicans on the Oversight Committee and has refused to comply with our subpoena with unclassified forms,â she told reporters this week.\n\nOn May 16, Greene introduced impeachment articles accusing Graves of âendangering, compromising, and underminingâ the justice system, because his office is currently declining to indict 67% of people arrested for local crimes in D.C., up from 35% in 2015, despite rising crime. (Graves has said the decline in prosecutions is partly due to police body-camera footage bringing more scrutiny to arrests as well as problems with D.C.âs crime lab).\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "The final lessons of the 2022 midterms\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nPhoto: FLICKR / Gage Skidmore\n\nItâs over. The re-election of Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock last week wrapped up the 2022 midterms. A few days later, California actually finished counting ballots, and a recount in Colorado confirmed the narrow victory of Rep. Lauren Boebert.\n\nSo, we have new clarity on what turned out to be the strongest midterm election for a party holding the White House in 20 years. There was a national shift toward the GOP, but not everywhere. The red wave was strongest in Florida, New York, and parts of California; it was a dribble, or less, in swing states like Michigan. Here are a few key things weâve learned.\n\nIn this article:\n\nNew York really was decisive\n\nRepublicans wound up with 222 seats, exactly what Democrats had two years earlier, when a series of close races broke against them. The GOP was luckier this year in a contest that came down to just 6,670 votes spread across the country.\n\nFirst, it pulled off a series of reed-thin victories in districts Donald Trump carried in 2020. Boebert, for instance, escaped the yearâs closest House race with a 551-vote win in a district that the former president won by 8.3 percent points. It was the largest red-to-blue shift in any district the Republicans won, but GOP candidates in Iowa and Iowa also pulled out narrow victories while underperforming Trump.\n\nAt the same time, Republicans outperformed their 2020 numbers in some states Democrats hoped would be strongholds, pulling off their most decisive win in New York. The fifth-closest House race, the one that sealed the GOP majority, was won by Mike Lawler over Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney. Lawlerâs 1,787-vote win represented a 10.9-point shift toward Republicans since 2020, when the Hudson Valley solidly rejected Donald Trump.\n\nWas that the reddest vote shift in New York? No! On Long Island, where Republicans swept all four House seats, they improved on Trumpâs 2020 numbers by an average of 16.8 points. Rep. Lee Zeldin wonât run to lead the Republican National Committee after all, but this is why so many conservatives wanted him to.\n\nRepublicans won a lot of wasted votes\n\nGerrymandering worked. As the Cook Political Reporterâs Dave Wasserman puts it, there are âtwo Housesâ â one that Republicans and Democrats drew to safely re-elect their candidates, and one that independent commissions drew, where the vast majority of competitive races unfolded. That also meant a whole lot of votes went to largely uncontested seats, skewing the national numbers.\n\nFor the first time in eight years, more Americans voted for Republicans than Democrats in races for the House. The GOP prevailed 51 percent to 48 percent, a 5.9-point red shift from 2020.\n\nBut many of those votes were effectively wasted running up the score in places Republicans were going to win anyway âÂ especially after redistricting shored up their safe seats, or Democrats simply declined to put up a candidate. In Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantisâs gerrymander turned three swing seats into safe GOP seats, the party improved by 12 points. In Arkansas, where Democrats barely contested anything, the GOP vote improved by 7.3 points.\n\nDemocrats also outperformed in their safe seats. In Pennsylvania, they drove margins higher than ever in suburban Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The same thing happened in Michigan, where Democrats actually improved on Joe Bidenâs 2020 performance by 0.2 points by winning landslides in Grand Rapids, suburban Detroit, and Flint.\n\nLooking just at seats that both parties bothered to run candidates, Republicans won the national vote by just 1.3 points overall, which helps explain their modest pickups.\n\nThe 2024 House battle starts in Biden districts where MAGA candidates donât fly\n\nEmphasis on âstarts.â Ohio and North Carolina Republicans may use their new state supreme court majorities to alter their maps, just as they ask the Supreme Court to let legislatures gerrymander without judges or independent commissions interfering. Republicans may be able to draw themselves safer seats before they have to go back to the voters.\n\nUntil then, the 2024 race starts in the 14 GOP-held seats that Biden carried â most of them in New York and California â and the five Trump-won seats that Democrats held onto or flipped. Democrats held Maineâs 2nd District and Alaskaâs at-large seat thanks to ranked-choice voting; they won Ohioâs Toledo-based 9th District, Pennsylvaniaâs Scranton-based 8th District, and southwest Washingtonâs 3rd District with populist candidates, facing MAGA candidates who alienated swing voters.\n\nThere was a quantifiable performance gap between the most MAGA-aligned Republicans and the incumbents and recruits less associated with Trump, which could point the way to a GOP rebuild if they can choose less alienating candidates in 2024. That was even true in red-drenched Florida, where the 31.1-point swing toward Rep. Carlos Gimenez was the biggest shift toward any Republican in the country, and the 1.2-point shift toward Rep.-elect Anna Paulina Luna was one of the smallest for any Republican in a gerrymandered seat. Gimenez could be critical of Trump, and voted to create the Jan. 6 committee; Luna ran as a next-generation MAGA activist.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Voters could reshape American election systems in 7 states\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nColorado is no longer a presidential battleground. Its ballot this year will still say a lot about US politics.\n\nThe stateâs voters will decide on a sweeping proposal to reshape its elections, backed by big business and opposed by the state parties, that would have a huge impact on congressional races, replacing traditional partisan primaries with a new nonpartisan system.\n\nColorado is one of seven states considering dramatic changes to the way their citizens vote, though the responses to votersâ âÂ and big donorsâ âÂ anger at the system vary widely. Nevada , Arizona , Idaho , Montana , South Dakota , and Oregon , as well as Washington, DC are considering options ranging from new top-two systems in Arizona and South Dakota to open primaries and ranked-choice general elections in Colorado, Nevada and Idaho. Then thereâs Alaska , which will vote this fall on whether to roll back its own unpredictable open primary and ranked-choice arrangement, which ironically has inspired other statesâ forays into election changes.\n\nColorado is considering a move from traditional partisan primaries to a nonpartisan top-four primary, with an instant ranked-choice runoff general election. Backers say the move would boost voter participation and encourage more serious legislators, but critics counter that it would lead to chaos and more dark money.\n\nThe shift is designed to chip at political partiesâ control of elections even as it risks empowering big donors to sway the open system â and itâs driving a wedge between elected officials in both parties. Both of Coloradoâs state parties oppose the proposal, alongside one of its Democratic senators and MAGA-friendly Rep. Lauren Boebert. Supporters of the voting changes include Coloradoâs Democratic governor, many of its big-city mayors and its other Democratic senator.\n\nâIn the time that Iâve represented Colorado, Iâve never had a single person, not one person, come up to me and say this is the way we should change our system,â Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet, whoâs opposed to the voting changes, told Semafor. âIf it passes and it turns out it doesnât work, how are we going to fix it?â\n\nHis fellow Colorado Democratic senator disagrees; John Hickenlooper says the change is a âwin-winâ that could increase voter participation and encourage more people to run as candidates. And former Republican congressman Ken Buck sees the remodeled primary as a chance to help his party become more competitive in a Democrat-dominated state.\n\nBuck, who narrowly lost a 2010 Senate race to Bennet, also hopes a new Colorado primary will attract âthe right candidatesâ for federal office: âI have been frustrated during my time in Congress with some of the social media darlings and folks who arenât interested in the legislative side of the business,â he told Semafor. âIâve never heard, in my lifetime, as much discontent from people about both sides.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nAlaska is currently the only state with a similarly structured top-four nonpartisan primary. Those four candidates advance to a general election that counts votersâ second and third choices in races where no candidate wins a majority on the first round of ballot counting.\n\nColorado has many more voters. And itâs not at all clear which party would benefit most. In Alaska, Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola capitalized on the stateâs quirky system, as did moderate Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski. Maine still uses partisan primaries, and Democratic Rep. Jared Golden won his seat in 2018 through its ranked-choice instant runoff.\n\nColorado and Nevada voting changes that get adopted this year could be tested in competitive elections as soon as 2026 or 2028. Hickenlooper, for one, is up for reelection in two years.\n\nIn the Centennial State, at least, itâs hard for Republicans to do too much worse than theyâve been doing in the Trump era. Buck said he hears from Republicans who âare happy that Iâm taking this position so that they donât have toâ tangle with the state party over its opposition. He made clear that he doesnât plan to test it as a candidate, saying heâs happy with his new life as a private citizen.\n\nâDemocrats have figured out a way in Colorado with third-party candidates to make sure that we donât end up with a Republican victory, and so this system would nullify that,â Buck said. âTheyâve also supported the most radical Republican candidate primaries to try to get the easiest candidate to win to beat in the general election. And again, this system would prevent that.â\n\nOne prominent government watchdog group has warned the new primary would reward âcandidates with more moneyâ who can flood the open-party zone; itâs true that in Colorado, as in other states, major donors support the voting changes. Chevron, the stateâs Chamber of Commerce and wealthy businessman Kent Thiry are all backing the shift, raising the ire of Bennet.\n\nâThese guys are just imposing, basically, their game theory on the American election system,â Bennet said. âThatâs wrong. What they are doing is undemocratic.â\n\nThereâs a reason Coloradoâs major political parties donât like the proposed election system: It would significantly water down their power, making coordinated campaigns more difficult and turning Coloradoâs elections into a literal Wild West.\n\nIt could also, if Alaska is any example, weed out more extreme candidates in both parties. But itâs hard to say just how it would play out in Colorado and Nevada, considering their swingy natures and larger populations. Itâs possible that the result would be two or even three members of the same party advancing to the general election.\n\nOther, smaller-scale election changes that are on the ballot in other states are more tested. In California and Louisiana, for example, top-two primaries often lead to compelling general election match-ups between members of the same party.\n\nWe couldnât talk to Buck without asking who heâs supporting for president, since he says part of the reason heâs backing the Colorado voting proposal is because Kamala Harris and Donald Trump âare a perfect example of why we need to focus more on the process and making sure we get the right candidates.â\n\nâI am considering not voting for either, because Iâm just so frustrated. I canât vote for Harris,â he said. âI have not committed and have expressed frustration more than appreciation for what [Trump] stands for.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Jamaal Bowman on Tuesday, nominating county executive George Latimer after the most expensive House primary in American history. That included a $14.5 million spend by AIPAC, which helped recruit Latimer. âSome so-called Democrats are aligning themselves with radical, racist right-wing Republicans,â Bowman told supporters as he conceded the race. âWe should be outraged when a super PAC of dark money can spend $20 million to brainwash people into believing something that isnât true.â Justice Democrats, which recruited and helped elect Bowman in 2020, said in a statement that the race âwas not a referendum on Israel-Palestine policies,â but the congressman sharply criticized Israel in the closing weeks, accusing Latimer of supporting âgenocideâ by opposing an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.âThis country can not afford to splinter into pieces,â Latimer told his supporters. âEvery single representative has to understand the need for unity.â\n\nâDavid Weigel\n\nColorado Rep. Lauren Boebert won the GOP nomination for a safe seat, but three other Trump-backed candidates faltered. Boebert, who switched districts after nearly losing her 2022 re-election, rolled over a divided field of lesser-known conservatives. But in the neighboring 5th District, Colorado GOP chair Dave Williams was crushed by conservative pundit Jeff Crank, despite Williams touting his Trump endorsement. In South Carolina, Trump-endorsed pastor Mark Burns narrowly lost a runoff to Sheri Biggs, a nurse endorsed by Gov. Henry McMaster. In Utah, Rep. John Curtis grabbed the GOP nomination to succeed Sen. Mitt Romney; Trump endorsed Trent Staggs, a conservative mayor who trailed by 26 points. American Leads Action and Conservatives for American Excellence, two super PACs funded by GOP donors sometimes critical of Trump, gave crucial support to Crank and Biggs.\n\nâDavid Weigel\n\nSemafor has appointed PBS News Hour co-anchor, Amna Nawaz, former Wall Street Journal writer, Jon Hilsenrath, former Wall Street Journal and Washington Post editor, Marcus Brauchli, and former New York Magazine journalist and Mixed Signals co-host, Nayeema Raza, as contributors. The contributors will work alongside Semaforâs editorial and events teams in Washington, D.C to produce and moderate compelling news-driven events, and weâll bring their voices into our newsletters when we can. In addition, Semafor has promoted Meera Pattni, its head of communications, to oversee its global live journalism business, working closely with senior editor Gina Chon. Pattni, a founding member of the Semafor leadership team, will be responsible for expanding and enhancing the companyâs global events portfolio. Maggie Soergel, formerly the head of events, has been promoted to general manager of live journalism.\n\nThe fallout from Rep. Bob Goodâs primary could extend beyond his Virginia district, where the race is headed for a contentious recount . House Freedom Caucus members are discussing whether to try and expel Ohio Rep. Warren Davidson from their ranks, multiple Congressional sources told Semaforâs Kadia Goba and David Weigel, after he endorsed John McGuire against Good, who chairs the ultra-conservative group. Itâs the latest strain in the group over its relationship with Donald Trump, who opposed Good in large part because he backed Ron DeSantis in the presidential race. Rep. Troy Nehls, for his part, said he was against ousting Davidson. âI donât wanna remove him,â the Texan HFC member told Semafor while wearing Trumpâs signature gold sneakers. âHeâs one of the smart ones.â\n\nNetherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte was appointed as NATOâs next secretary-general. The move became a formality after his only rival quit the race last week , but Rutte had earlier faced difficulty persuading Eastern European nations, and especially Hungary, whose premier Viktor Orban is Europeâs most pro-Russian figure. Rutte is a critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin and strongly pro-Ukraine, and in 2018 earned the nickname of â the Trump whisperer â after convincing the then US president that Europe was boosting its defense spending. He faces a full in-tray: As well as the war in Ukraine on NATOâs doorstep, there is uncertainty over the USâ future involvement in the alliance should Donald Trump be elected once again.\n\nBoth President Biden and Donald Trump are telegraphing their punches ahead of tomorrowâs debate. Bidenâs campaign put out a new ad yesterday saying Trump was out for ârevengeâ and tax cuts for the wealthy, rather than helping middle class voters. One campaign official noted heâs been âpunchierâ lately and said to expect an aggressive approach. Trump has brought up killings by migrants on Truth Social and Semaforâs Shelby Talcott reports that heâll likely invite family members of victims to Atlanta as his guests, although the debate itself will have no audience. TNRâs Greg Sargent writes that Democrats should be prepared for the attack and polled some big-name strategists on possible responses. If Trump wants to really blow up the debate, he has another option: NBC News reports heâs weighing announcing a running mate before the event.\n\nIn the latest episode of Mixed Signals from Semafor Media , presented by Think With Google, Ben, Nayeema, and Max report from Cannes, decoding the year ahead for the ad business amidst the panels and parties. While enjoying the CÃ ́te dâAzur, they discuss Washingtonâs move to ban TikTok and the companyâs denial of whatâs unfolding. Then, they weigh in on whether Will Lewis, CEO of the Washington Post, will survive.\n\nListen to this episode of Mixed Signals wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nPolitico is losing some of its biggest names as it faces internal discontent over a new editing regime, Semaforâs Maxwell Tani reports . The latest batch of departures: Alex Ward, co-author of Politicoâs massive scoop about the Supreme Courtâs decision to overturn Roe v.

Libertarian Hannah Goodman had 2% of the votes, Approval Voting candidate Frank Atwood had 1%, and Unity Party candidate Paul Fiorino had less than a half a percent.\n\nBoebert is a self-described America First Republican who has been one of Donald Trump's most ardent supporters. She said her top issues are securing the U.S.'s southern border, protecting the state's water and the oil and gas industry, and stopping the \"reckless government spending of Bidenomics.\"\n\nBoebert announced in late 2023 that she would not run again in her current district in order to pursue the seat held by Republican Rep. Ken Buck, who left Congress in early 2024. He cited concerns with the direction of the Republican Party and efforts to overturn the 2020 election .\n\nRepublican Greg Lopez gained the seat temporarily after a June special election.\n\nThe 4th District has a greater ratio of Republicans than the 3rd District. Had Boebert stayed in the 3rd District race, she would have faced another battle with Democrat Adam Frisch, who came close to defeating her in 2022 - the margin was 0.2%.\n\nBoebert will retain the 4th District seat for Republicans but didn't gain as much support as Buck had during his tenure. He received more than 60% of the votes in the district in races dating back to 2014.\n\nBoebert was elected to her current seat in the 3rd District with 51% of the votes in 2020 and 50% in 2022."

Lauren Boebert\n\nOffice sought: U.S. representative, Colorado's 4th Congressional District\n\nParty: Republican\n\nWebsite: laurenforcolorado.com\n\nBoebert is running against Democrat Trisha Calvarese and third-party candidates Frank Atwood, Paul Fiorino and Hannah Goodman. Atwood and Goodman did not respond to the Coloradoan's invitation to fill out our Q&A.\n\nBoebert's answers are below. Responses have been edited for spelling and to conform to AP style.\n\nI currently serve as a U.S. congresswoman where Coloradans have seen me grow into an effective legislator since starting in 2021. They know I will fight for our values and priorities, like getting the Pueblo Jobs Act signed into law to create 1,000 jobs and help our economy bounce back from suffering under Bidenomics, all while fighting for our small businesses and reducing red tape.\n\nI ran for office because I didn't want my four boys to grow up in a socialist nation with trillions of dollars of debt. We need America First fighters who are willing to stand up to both parties to fight for conservative values and get things done for Coloradans, which I've shown I can do since first getting elected to Congress.\n\nWe absolutely need to secure our southern border, where millions have entered illegally under the Biden-Harris administration and have brought drugs and crime into our neighborhoods. I voted for H.R. 2 , which passed the House and would bring back actual border security without compromising our safety. I also introduced the Build the Wall & Deport Them All Act, which brings back President Trump's successful border policies like ending catch and release, finishing the wall, and restoring the Remain in Mexico policy.\n\nProtecting our state's most important resources, like water and our oil and gas industry. I've secured $20 million in water and infrastructure projects in Colorado so we can store our water to benefit Coloradans, especially ranchers and farmers. I've passed legislation with bipartisan support to promote Colorado's energy sector and I'm opposed to the Green New Deal schemes that would crush our oil and gas workers and further regulate our rural communities into poverty. If we want clean energy, let's start with promoting Colorado's natural gas and encouraging nuclear.\n\nWe need to stop the reckless government spending of Bidenomics that have regulated our communities into poverty and crushed small businesses. The trillions of dollars spent by Biden-Harris led to record-highs for inflation including unaffordable gas and groceries, skyrocketing interest rates, and increased rent and housing costs that priced people out of their homes. When spending is under control, Americans will be able to live comfortably again.\n\nMy opponent is focused on me while I'm focused on Coloradans. Voters know I'll stand up to reckless government spending, fight back against Bidenomics and the Green New Deal by protecting our oil and gas industry, work to secure our southern border, and get things done for Coloradans on major topics like water and infrastructure. I have the proven track record as an effective legislator and I'll continue to build on my accomplishments when I represent the 4th District.\n\nThe Coloradoan newsroom is dedicated to helping you be an informed voter in the upcoming election.

Al Green's protest during President Donald Trump's joint address to Congress.\n\nBoebert criticized Green for shaking his cane at Trump during his address, while the Texas Democrat was protesting Medicaid cuts proposed by the administration. Green was escorted out of the U.S. Capitol chamber early on in Trump's speech and was subsequently censured for a \"breach of proper conduct.\"\n\n\"For him to go and shake his pimp cane at President Trump was absolutely abhorrent,\" Boebert said during a Friday appearance on Real America's Voice .\n\nHoulahan's apparent move to defend Green comes after she joined 10 fellow Democrats and all House Republicans in voting in favor of the censure measure against Green.\n\n\"After my discussion on the House floor last week when Speaker Johnson told me he'd have to censure half the members if he actually enforced the rules of the Congress, I decided to help, and tonight introduced a resolution to censure Representative Boebert for her racist and derogatory statements about Representative Al Green (D-TX),\" Houlahan said in a press release .\n\nIn other State of the Union speeches or joint addresses to Congress by the president, representatives have jeered or interrupted speeches, sometimes without consequence .\n\nOne of the most famous example of interruptions during a joint session of Congress came in 2009 when Rep.

Boebert shouted \"13 of them,\" referring to troops killed in Afghanistan during the American withdrawal from the country.\n\nThen in 2023, Greene again heckled Biden, shouting \"Liar!\" during the address, a motion to censure her was introduced but never passed.\n\nContributing: George Petras and Jennifer Borresen, USA TODAY\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert swaps congressional districts as she faces tight reelection campaign\n\nU.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert will not seek reelection in Colorado's 3rd Congressional District and will instead run for the state's 4th Congressional District seat, the second-term congresswoman announced Wednesday.\n\nRather than mount a rematch campaign against Democratic challenger Adam Frisch in what likely would've been one of the most watched and tightly contested House races in the country, Boebert will now run for the seat being vacated by U.S. Rep. Ken Buck, who announced in November he would not seek a sixth term.\n\n\"I did not arrive at this decision easily,\" Boebert said in a news release announcing the decision. \"A lot of prayer, a lot of tough conversations, and a lot of perspective have convinced me this is the best way I can continue to fight for Colorado, for the conservative movement, for my kids' future, and for the future of this great country.\"\n\nBoebert's contest against Frisch drew national attention to Pueblo on Election Day 2022. She narrowly bested the Democrat from Aspen by just 546 votes in the strong Republican-leaning district that encompasses Pueblo and the Western Slope.\n\nFrisch has also far outraised Boebert throughout his 2024 campaign.\n\nThe 3 rd District holds a nine-point Republican advantage, which increased after redistricted maps were finalized in 2021, but Colorado's 4 th District is even redder with a 27-point Republican advantage, bolstering Boebert's election chances.\n\nHouse of Representatives members do not need to live in the district they represent.\n\n\"Professionally, Colorado's 4th District is hungry for an unapologetic defender of freedom with a proven track record of standing strong for conservative principles. I love Colorado's 3rd District and I will continue working as hard as I can for the remainder of my term to be a great Representative for the district,\" Boebert said in the release.\n\n\"But I also spent years living on the Front Range and years representing Rural America. The 3rd and the 4th Congressional Districts comprise nearly 85% of Colorado's footprint and have less than 20 people per square mile. Rural America deserves a strong voice that fights for their freedoms.\"\n\nIn the release, Boebert stated that her move to the 4 th District will help \"stop Hollywood elites and national progressive groups from buying the 3rd District.\"\n\n\"They aren't pouring millions into the 3rd District based on policy differences, they are pouring it in because they know what a threat I am to their liberal agenda,\" she said. \"I will not allow dark-money that is directed at destroying me to steal this seat. It's not fair to the 3rd District and the conservatives there who have fought so hard for our victories, of which I'm incredibly grateful.\"\n\nIn a news release Wednesday evening, Colorado Democratic Party Chair Shad Murib called Boebert's decision \"cowardly.\"\n\n\"The good people of Western and Southern Colorado didn't wait for an election to beat Lauren Boebert - we scared her straight and chased her out of her own district. With this carpetbagging move, Lauren Boebert has shown herself to be everything she claims she isn't: a typical swampy politician looking for a reason to call Washington D.C. home. She's a loser in CD3, and she'll be a loser in CD4 - Coloradans won't buy her bulls--- in 2024,\" Murib said in the statement.\n\n\"Colorado Democrats launched The 546 Project, our unprecedented year-round campaign in Western and Southern Colorado, to make sure that rural Colorado is represented by someone committed to protecting our outdoor spaces, expanding health care, and treating people right - not hurting our farmers and ranchers with bad policies and foolish trade wars, or selling our public lands off to the highest bidders. We look forward to this fight.\"\n\nBuck, the conservative Republican who represents much of Colorado's eastern plains, announced Nov. 1 he would not seek a sixth term in Congress and cited those in his party who refuse to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election and to condemn the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, the Associated Press reported.\n\nIn running for Buck's soon-to-be-vacated seat, Boebert joins a crowded field that includes state Rep. Richard Holtorf of Akron, Conservative radio host Deborah Flora, former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg of Sterling, and former state Sen. Ted Harvey of Highlands Ranch, according to the Colorado Sun.\n\nChieftain Editor Zach Hillstrom can be reached at zhillstrom@gannett.com or on X, formerly Twitter, at @ZachHillstrom.

Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., said she will not be going on another date with the man she was removed from a musical with in an incident earlier this month.\n\nBoebert and the man were kicked out of the performance in a Denver theater for disruptive behavior. An incident report from the Buell Theater, obtained by USA TODAY, said two unidentified patrons \"received three different complaints\" and were accused of \"vaping, singing, causing a disturbance.\"\n\nThe patrons, the report said, later refused to leave after they were asked to exit the venue, allegedly making statements such as \"Do you know who I am?\"\n\nBoebert told TMZ at an airport in Washington that \"It's always hard whenever there's gravity put on the voters. I'm here to provide levity and lift burdens off of people.\"\n\n\"Ultimately all future date nights have been canceled, and I learned to check party affiliations before you go on a date,\" she said, referencing reports that the man who appears in surveillance video of the incident with her is a Democrat. \"But all in all, it was mostly a lovely time, and I've taken responsibility for my actions.\"\n\nShe said voters have been \"understanding\" that the moment was part of her personal life.\n\n\"He's a wonderful man, and it was a great time to go out, have dinner and enjoy part of a show, and now it's back to work,\" she said. \"He's a private citizen, and we have peacefully parted at this time.

Lauren Boebert is no stranger to controversy.\n\nBoebert is making local and national headlines for a recent incident - she and her date were asked to leave a performance of the \"Beetlejuice\" musical in downtown Denver Sunday evening because of disruptive behavior.\n\nWhile a document about the incident and a spokesperson for Denver Arts and Venues did not confirm the identities of the individuals, Boebert confirmed on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, she didn't catch the entire show.\n\n\"It's true, I did thoroughly enjoy the AMAZING Beetlejuice at the Buell Theatre and I plead guilty to laughing and singing too loud,\" Boebert wrote , adding a smiling emoji with a hand covering its mouth. \"Everyone should go see it if you get the chance this week and please let me know how it ends!\"\n\nHere's what we know about what happened at the Buell Theatre on Sunday evening.\n\nAccording to an incident report shared with the Chieftain, three complaints were shared with staff about patrons that were \"vaping, singing,\" and \"causing a disturbance\" in their seats close to the stage. Ushers also noticed the pair vaping and disturbing other patrons by singing and using cell phones, according to the report.\n\nStaff gave the pair a verbal warning that they would be asked to leave if their behavior continued. But five minutes into the second act, there was another complaint about them being loud and recording, so they were asked to leave.\n\nPhoto and video recording is prohibited at Denver Performing Arts Complex performances and the \"policy is strictly enforced,\" according to its website .\n\nBoebert's campaign manager, Drew Sexton, told the Chieftain Boebert was not vaping during the performance.\n\nSexton said in a written statement that Boebert \"appreciates\" the \"strict enforcement\" of the ban on photography \"and only wishes the Biden Administration could uphold our border laws as thoroughly and vigorously.\"\n\n\"Congresswoman Boebert strongly encourages everyone to go see Beetlejuice, which runs at [the] Buell through September 17 and features a fantastic cast, tremendous visuals, and plenty of laughs for attendees, but with a gentle reminder to leave their phones outside the venue,\" Sexton added.\n\nBrian Kitts, a spokesperson for Denver Arts and Venues, declined to comment on the incident.\n\nThe incident was first reported by the Denver Post Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe pair were argumentative with staff who asked them to leave, according to the incident report.\n\nWhen first warned at their seats, the incident report states the pair said, \"they were in concert with everyone around them.\"\n\nAfter being escorted out of the show, they allegedly said they would wait for Denver Police Department officers to arrive but left after a staff member told them they could be banned from attending future performances if they stayed there.\n\nA staff member stated that Boebert and her guest said things like, 'Do you know who I am?', 'I am on the board,' (and), 'I will be contacting the mayor,'\" the incident report details.\n\nJordan Fuja, a spokesperson in Denver Mayor Mike Johnston's office, told the Chieftain Wednesday via email that \"there hasn't been any contact with the Mayor's office about this.\"\n\nIt also appears that Boebert and her date are not on any local Denver art boards or commissions.\n\nThe Daily Mail identified Boebert's date as Quinn Gallagher, who lives in the Aspen area. Neither Boebert nor Gallagher are on the Denver arts commissions or boards at the Denver Performing Arts Complex, the Chieftain confirmed with multiple spokespeople.\n\nBoebert is seen leaving the venue hand in hand with her date: they held hands and twirled around as they were exiting the nearly empty performing arts complex in Denver during the show.\n\nThe Daily Mail reported Wednesday morning that Boebert's companion was \"DEMOCRAT\" Quinn Gallagher, who co-owns a bar in Aspen.\n\nThe Daily Mail cites an anonymous, \"well-connected\" source who told the outlet they \"always thought Quinn was a cool guy and a Democrat. His parents would be horrified because they are definitely blue.\"\n\nThe article includes paparazzi-style photos of Gallagher that strongly resemble the man captured on the surveillance footage in Denver.\n\nSexton, Boebert's campaign manager, did not respond to a request to confirm if Gallagher attended the Denver show with Boebert.\n\nOne of the key assertions in the Daily Mail story appears to be false. Public records show that Gallagher is registered as an unaffiliated voter, not with the Democratic Party.\n\nGallagher appears to not have made any political contributions to county and state elections in Colorado. His name also did not appear in a search of federal campaign finance records, which itemizes contributions from donors who contribute at least $200 during an election cycle.\n\nBoebert filed for divorce from her husband Jayson Boebert on April 25 because of an \"irretrievably broken\" marriage. They have four boys together - the oldest, still a teenager, recently had a baby .\n\nThe congresswoman intervened in a 911 call in December 2022 when one of her sons reported that his dad was \"throwing me around.\" The boy said his mom was living in a farmhouse on the property because of issues within the family. Lauren Boebert and her son followed up with the dispatcher on another call less than five minutes after the first one was placed, saying that Jayson Boebert didn't get physical with him.\n\nDonald Trump Jr., Lauren Boebert rail against Bidens, FBI and Trump indictments in Pueblo\n\nAnna Lynn Winfrey covers politics for the Pueblo Chieftain.

Lauren Boebert, R-Colo. , on Tuesday won her first primary election after switching districts and running in a deeper-red area earlier this year.\n\nBoebert beat a field of five competitors in the GOP race in Colorado's 4th District. The Republican firebrand currently represents the neighboring 3 rd District in Colorado, which encompasses much of the western part of the state.\n\nBut Boebert decided to take a chance with the electorate in the eastern half of Colorado last year after Republican Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., confirmed that he would not seek a sixth term to represent the 4th District.\n\nAt the time, experts speculated that Boebert swapped areas to avoid an embarrassing defeat. In 2022, she narrowly beat her Democratic rival for the 3rd District seat by just 546 votes. Boebert's former Democratic challenger, Adam Frisch, is running again this year.\n\nWhen Boebert announced that she was switching districts, she said in a statement \"this is the best way I can continue to fight for Colorado, for the conservative movement, for my kids' future, and for the future of this great country.\"\n\nA member of the Freedom Caucus, Boebert's win also comes after she faced a series of public scandals that created questions about her political future. In 2023, Boebert was kicked out of a theater for allegedly \" vaping, singing, causing a disturbance \" with her date at the time.\n\nBoebert's 18-year-old son was also arrested earlier this year on 20 criminal charges, including conspiracy to commit a felony, first degree criminal trespassing and theft. And her husband, Jayson Boebert was charged with assault among several other charges in January 2024 after police responded to an incident involving the congresswoman.\n\nWith her primary win on Tuesday, Boebert is expected to head back to Congress next year after she competes againstDemocrat Trisha Calvarese in the November election. Colorado's 4 th District is heavily Republican, and voters in the area are likely to back the GOP candidate. Buck, for instance, won the area by more than 20 points in the 2022 midterms."

She was diagnosed with May-Thurner syndrome, which causes blood clots in the leg due to pelvic artery swelling.\n\nDoctors removed the clot and inserted a stent in a Tuesday morning surgery, the release stated.\n\n\"I want to thank Dr. Rebecca Bade and the entire team at UCHealth Medical Center of the Rockies for their great care and providing helpful insight on my recent diagnosis,\" said Boebert in the statement. \"I'm looking forward to making a full recovery and getting back to Congress to continue fighting for Colorado.\"\n\nAccording to the University of Maryland Medical Center, May-Thurner syndrome occurs when a pinched vein near the pelvis prevents normal bloodflow through the leg.\n\nThe disease is more common in women aged 20 to 40 who were previously pregnant, according to the medical center.\n\nBoebert's campaign said she is expected to be able to get back to work after a brief recovery period.\n\nBoebert has been representing Colorado's Third Congressional District since 2021. But in December, she announced that she would run for the vacated seat in the Fourth Congressional District instead, avoiding a head-to-head battle with Democratic challenger Adam Frisch.\n\nHer campaign has been riddled with personal issues, including an ongoing dispute with her ex-husband , going viral for apparently getting kicked out of a theater with a date, and her son's arrest ."

But by Friday, Representative Lauren Boebert had decided to sling some mud on the situation for good measure.\n\n\"For him to go and shake his pimp cane at President Trump was absolutely abhorrent,\" Boebert, who was caught on surveillance footage fondling her date during a showing of Beetlejuice in 2023, told Real America's Voice .\n\nBoebert was referring to the 77-year-old Texas Democrat's walking cane.\n\nWhen Trump claimed during his Tuesday night speech that he had been given a \"mandate\" by the American people to radically reimagine the federal government, Green interrupted the president by yelling, \"You have no mandate to cut Medicaid!\"\n\nThat got Green ousted by House Speaker Mike Johnson, who called on the sergeant of arms to remove the 77-year-old from the chamber against a backdrop of jeers from Republicans.\n\n\"I did it from my heart, and I will suffer whatever the consequences are,\" Green told reporters the next day. \"But truthfully, I would do it again.\"\n\nSenate Republicans are working to pass a budget that even party members have recently admitted will result in a $880 billion cut to Medicaid, much to the chagrin of their own constituents. The multibillion-dollar cut is a trade-off for conservatives who were tasked by Donald Trump to extend his 2017 tax plan, which will overwhelmingly benefit corporations and is projected to add as much as $15 trillion to the national deficit.\n\nGreen's protest was practically the only noticeable rejection of Trump's agenda that Democrats could muster Tuesday night. Other liberal lawmakers were torched for flipping paddles that read \"False,\" \"Musk Steals,\" and \"Save Medicaid\" in a silent protest in the face of the administration's apparent oligarchy and its systemic dismantling of the federal government.\n\nAnd viewers watching live at home would never have known that a handful of Democrats stood up and walked out of the chamber in protest, as TV cameras never bothered to pan to their mute, \"dignified\" spectacle. Others, such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Patty Murray, opted to not show up at all."

This comes after recent rulings against the Trump administration, such as a decision over the weekend by Judge James Boasberg in the Federal District Court in the nation's capital.\n\nBoasberg ruled on Saturday that the administration must turn around planes carrying alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador , but the administration didn't comply, leading to worries about a possible constitutional crisis. Trump then argued on social media that Boasberg must be impeached.\n\nOn Wednesday, Musk donated to Boebert of Colorado , Eli Crane of Arizona , Andrew Clyde of Georgia , Andy Ogles of Tennessee , Derrick Van Orden of Wisconsin and Brandon Gill of Texas, as well as Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley , according to The Times.\n\nGill introduced articles of impeachment against the judge after he issued an order temporarily blocking Trump's use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport the Venezuelans. Boebert backed the impeachment articles against the judge, with Musk expressing his approval on X.\n\nCrane put forward articles of impeachment against Judge Paul Engelmayer of the District Court of the Southern District of New York after he temporarily limited the access to the Treasury Department 's payment and data systems for the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk's vehicle for slashing the federal government.\n\n\"We didn't do it so Elon Musk would give us a campaign donation,\" Crane told The Times. \"But I think it's great that individuals like Elon are throwing support behind those of us willing to take action.\"\n\nClyde told the paper that he had \"no prior knowledge that Elon Musk would make a campaign donation\" but added, \"I am very thankful that he did.\"\n\nOgles introduced a resolution to allow Trump to serve another term in the White House . He told The Times that Musk's \"dedication isn't just commendable - it's vital to our Republic's future.\"\n\n\"For more than two centuries, there has never [been] such extreme abuse of the legal system by activists pretending to be judges. Impeach them,\" Musk said Wednesday on X.\n\nGrassley is the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee . He hasn't called for impeaching Boasberg but wrote on X: \"Another day, another judge unilaterally deciding policy for the whole country. This time to benefit foreign gang members If the Supreme Court or Congress doesn't fix, we're headed towards a constitutional crisis. Senate Judiciary Cmte taking action.\"\n\nMusk spent nearly $300 million on the 2024 election, and his super PAC has indicated that it will focus on down-ballot races this year. The billionaire owner of Tesla and SpaceX has usually preferred to back his own groups rather than handing money directly to politicians. He didn't initially donate to the Trump campaign in 2024, instead backing his Trump-supporting super PAC.\n\nThe president called for Boasberg to be impeached on Tuesday.\n\n\"This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED!!!\" the president wrote on Truth Social .\n\nThis prompted Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to say in a statement that \"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.\"\n\n\"The normal appellate review process exists for that purpose,\" said Roberts."

Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Nancy Mace of South Carolina who were involved in an incident on Thursday that transgender Democratic Rep. Sarah McBride's office called \"predictable.\"\n\nThe pair confronted a cisgender woman in the restroom, mistakenly believing her to be the Delaware Democratic lawmaker , who is the first out transgender member of Congress. McBride had previously said she would follow House rules after Johnson banned transgender people from using the bathroom in line with their gender identity. The incident has reignited criticism of Johnson's anti-trans bathroom regulations, which critics say endanger and harass all women.\n\nKeep up with the latest in LGBTQ + news and politics.

Mace, who has positioned herself as a defender of women and frequently comments on bathroom policies, has remained silent about this incident. However, on Friday morning, she tweeted her objection to gender-neutral bathrooms. Responding to Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett, who shared a photo of what appeared to be a single-use gender-neutral bathroom accessible for people with disabilities in the Department of Veterans Affairs, Mace wrote, \"Absolutely not. Hold the line.\"\n\nMcBride, who was not present during the confrontation, confirmed to The Daily Beast that she had no interaction with Boebert or Mace. Michaela Kurinsky-Malos, McBride's deputy chief of staff and communications director, told The Advocate what happened was unsurprising. \"What a thoroughly predictable - and predicted - outcome,\" Kurinsky-Malos said. \"Representative McBride thinks people should get back to work rather than play bathroom police.\"\n\nNew York Democratic Rep.

      "text": "Republican US Rep. Lauren Boebert wins after switching districts in Colorado\n\nManage your account\n\nWINDSOR, Colo. (AP) - Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert won a House seat Tuesday in a Colorado district where she moved midway through her term to avoid what would have been a tough reelection bid in her old district.\n\nBoebert, a rabble-rouser who's helped define an ultra-conservative flank of the U.S. House, took a gamble in moving races, and it paid off. Boebert beat Trisha Calvarese, the former director of speech writing and publications at the AFL-CIO, a federation of labor unions, who called herself an \"old-school labor Democrat.\"\n\nBoebert had held the 3rd Congressional District seat in the Rocky Mountains since 2020. She left for the more conservative 4th Congressional District on the Great Plains after a near loss two years ago, followed by surveillance video emerged of her vaping and groping a date at a Denver theater. Boebert initially explained her move by saying, \"There is a need for my voice in Congress,\" and later focused on wanting a fresh start for her family after a messy divorce.\n\nIn doing so, she escaped what would have been a tough rematch against a Democrat who nearly unseated her in 2022. Adam Frisch lost that election to Boebert by just 546 votes , campaigning against what he dubbed her \"angertainment.\" Frisch remained in a tight race against Republican Jeff Hurd that was too early to call early Wednesday.\n\nDuring the Republican primary in the 4th District, Boebert avoided a surprise political threat with some behind-the-scenes jostling and fended off accusations of carpetbagging from her opponent and glancing references to her embarrassing moment at the Denver theater.\n\nEventually with six candidates left, Boebert's well-known political brand and endorsement from presidential candidate Donald Trump helped pull her to victory in the primary, and now the general election.\n\nBoebert will be filling Republican Rep. Ken Buck's old seat . When Buck resigned , the conservative cited a flank of the Republican Party's hardheaded politics and unwavering devotion to Trump - traits that made Boebert a name brand.\n\nBoebert has said that her intractable politics - stonewalling the January 2023 vote to elect Rep. Kevin McCarthy as House speaker for a series of concessions, for example - are promises kept on the campaign trail.\n\n\"The swamp, they thought I would fail, but you all welcomed me to Winsor, Colorado,\" Boebert told the crowd in her victory speech in the northern Colorado city of Windsor, referring to her decision to change races, to a raucous crowd, ending with a chant of \"Fight, fight, fight!\"\n\nAfter a fiery speech woven with firearm references, a Boebert staple, the congresswoman struck a conciliatory note. \"And to all of those who did not support me, who did not vote for me, I'm extending an olive branch. Let me prove to you exactly what I can do for you,\" she said. \"I'll see you in the future.\"\n\nIn a statement, Calvarese said she called the congresswoman to concede the race. \"I told her I had no doubt we could count on her to do her part to keep our democracy intact,\" Calvarese said. \"Now, she bears a duty. Lauren Boebert must certify the legitimate results of the presidential election.\"\n\nSome questions remain as to whether Boebert's withdrawal from her old district was enough for Republicans to hold onto the seat. Frisch, had already pulled in an astounding number of donations for a non-incumbent before Boebert departed, fundraising off of his near success in beating her in 2022.\n\nThe thrust of Frisch's campaign was to \"stop the circus,\" dubbing Boebert's style \"angertainment.\" Without the congresswoman as political foil, Frisch has fallen back onto his politically moderate platform, emphasizing that he will be a voice for rural constituents and take a bipartisan approach to policy.\n\nFrisch, a former Aspen councilman and currency trader, still has one of the largest House campaign chests in the country. It far overshadows GOP candidate Hurd's coffers.\n\nIt's unclear how much that will make a difference. The district still leans red, and Hurd, an attorney, is a more temperate conservative than his predecessor, with fewer gaffs. Hurd has said his goal is to make local headlines instead of national ones. The \"R\" next to his name on the ballot might be all that's needed.\n\n___\n\nBedayn is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Lauren Boebert announced Wednesday she is switching congressional districts, avoiding a likely rematch against a Democrat who has far outraised her and following an embarrassing moment of groping and vaping that shook even loyal supporters.\n\nIn a Facebook video Wednesday evening, Ms. Boebert announced she would enter the crowded Republican primary in retiring Rep. Ken Buck's seat in the eastern side of the state, leaving the more competitive 3rd District seat she barely won last year - and which she was in peril of losing next year as some in her party have soured on her controversial style.\n\nMr. Boebert implied in the video that her departure from the district would help Republicans retain the seat, saying, \"I will not allow dark money that is directed at destroying me personally to steal this seat. It's not fair to the 3rd District and the conservatives there who have fought so hard for our victories.\"\n\n\"The Aspen donors, George Soros, and Hollywood actors that are trying to buy this seat, well they can go pound sand,\" she said.\n\nMs. Boebert called it \"a fresh start,\" acknowledging the rough year following a divorce with her husband and video of her misbehaving with a date at a performance of the musical \"Beetlejuice\" in Denver. The scandal in September rocked some of her faithful supporters, who saw it as a transgression of conservative, Christian values for which Ms. Boebert apologized at events throughout her district.\n\nShe already faced a primary challenge in her district, as well as a general election face-off with Democrat Adam Frisch, a former Aspen city council member who came within a few hundred votes of beating her in 2022. A rematch was expected, with Mr. Frisch raising at least $7.7 million to Ms. Boebert's $2.4 million.\n\nInstead, if Ms. Boebert wins the primary to succeed Rep. Buck she will run in the state's most conservative district, which former President Donald Trump won by about 20 percentage points in 2020, in contrast to his margin of about 8 percentage points in her district. While it's not required that a representative live in the congressional district they represent, only the state the district is in, Ms. Boebert said she would be moving - a shift from Colorado's western Rocky Mountain peaks and high desert mesas to its eastern expanse of prairie grass and ranching enclaves.\n\nIn 2022, Mr. Frisch's campaign found support in the conservative district from unaffiliated voters and Republicans who'd defected over Ms. Boebert's brash, Trumpian style. In this election, Frisch's campaign had revived the slogan \"stop the circus\" and framed Mr. Frisch as the \"pro-normal\" alternative to Ms. Boebert's more partisan politics.\n\nIn a statement after Ms. Boebert's announcement, Mr. Frisch said he's prepared for whoever will be the Republican candidate.\n\n\"From Day 1 of this race, I have been squarely focused on defending rural Colorado's way of life, and offering common sense solutions to the problems facing the families of Colorado's 3rd Congressional District.\" he said. \"My focus will remain the same.\"\n\nThe Republican primary candidate who has raised the second most behind Ms. Boebert in the 3rd District, Jeff Hurd, is a more traditional Republican candidate. Mr. Hurd has already garnered support from prominent Republicans in the district, first reported by VailDaily.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

In the past week, Colorado's 3rd Congressional District has demonstrated that.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, Trump-backed incumbent Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert had edged about 1,100 votes ahead of Democratic challenger Adam Frisch, a far cry from national forecasts for a shoo-in second term. Today is the deadline for Colorado clerks to receive military and overseas ballots, as well as ballots that needed \" curing \" over signature issues. It remains unclear when the count will conclude - and whether a recount (state-ordered or otherwise requested by a campaign) awaits.\n\nAmid the uncertainty since Nov. 8, interviews with voters make at least one thing clear: The race has united CO-3 in a waiting game.\n\nA Trump-backed incumbent finds herself in a tighter race than expected. As election workers persevere, the nail-biter has demanded patience from a far-flung voter base.\n\n\"Every day I check the tally,\" says Frisch voter Laura Van Deusen, a middle school math teacher in Rifle who's concerned about women's rights and the environment.\n\n\"It doesn't sound like she wants to listen to the other side,\" she says, whereas Mr. Frisch \"really talked about working on both sides of the aisle. \"\n\nBoebert voter Gene Trujillo, on the other hand, has resisted constant checking of the count, he says, as it \" kind of weighs heavy on the heart sometimes.\" The retired railroad worker in Walsenburg sees a strong Second Amendment supporter and \"pro-life\" advocate in his congresswoman. \"She comes across as knowing what's right and wrong, and that pleases me.\"\n\nDuring her first term in Congress, far-right Representative Boebert has been noted nationally for her loyalty to former President Donald Trump, defense of gun rights, and upending of establishment norms - including remarks this summer about being \"tired of this separation of church and state junk.\" Mr. Frisch, a businessman and former city council member in the luxury mountain town of Aspen, has campaigned as a moderate, downplaying his Democratic status.\n\nSome CO-3 voters see the race as a residual referendum on the last president (who just announced his bid for 2024).\n\n\"She's a loudmouth like Trump,\" says Republican Doug Wight, a resident of New Castle on the Western Slope, on his support for Ms. Boebert. \"Once they get to Washington, they don't do anything anyway - she's just fun to watch. \"\n\nHe's in Silt at his shop, Gold Ring Pawn. A red Trump shirt hangs among liberal-bashing signs and racks of rifles and shotguns. The economy and gun control, which he opposes, are top issues for Mr. Wight, who rests his elbow on a Gadsden flag mouse pad.\n\nThe tight race is \"concerning,\" says Mr. Wight, who doubts President Joe Biden was legally elected. But in the end he throws up his hands: \"Whatever happens, happens.\"\n\nIn the southern city of Pueblo, Lynette Baca, who relies on disability benefits, has felt the crunch of inflation. But that wasn't enough to sway the Democrat's vote. Ms. Baca says she chose Mr. Frisch, whose sign sits on her lawn, \" because I don't believe in what Lauren stands for.\" For one, Ms. Baca, a Roman Catholic, is, herself, against abortion, but she respects other women's right to choose - a compromise in contrast to the congresswoman's hard-line stance.\n\nAnother red flag: \"I'm so against Trump,\" says Ms. Baca. She cradles a friend's baby on the couch, her darkened living room aglow with a Minions movie.\n\nCO-3 is a three-quarters white, largely rural region, with population centers like Grand Junction in the west and Pueblo to the south. It embraces farmers and ranchers facing drought-wracked fields, upscale skiing in the high country, and university enclaves.\n\nMs. Boebert won her primary by 32 points in June over Republican state Sen. Don Coram, who went on to endorse Mr. Frisch. The November election \"should have been a fairly easy win for Lauren Boebert, but it certainly did not develop that way,\" says Justin Gollob, professor of political science at Colorado Mesa University in Grand Junction. Not only was she an incumbent, but being a member of the party opposing the president (especially one faulted for inflation) also seemed to sweeten the deal ahead of Election Day.\n\nColorado Independent Redistricting Commissions, New York Times\n\nColorado \"often has been thought of in the not-so-distant past as a purple state,\" says Professor Gollob. But given recent electoral trends, he adds, \"it's hard to come to a conclusion other than this is a state that's trending blue with deep-red regional pockets.\"\n\nDemocrats here control seats for governor, secretary of state, attorney general, and the state legislature - a monopoly that survived the midterms . But the last time a Democrat won the CO-3 seat was in 2008.\n\nAs the sun sets on Grand Junction, the race is marinating in the minds of grocery shoppers outside a City Market.\n\nAs she loads bags into a car, Republican voter Lori Chandler says she wasn't too surprised by the close count - and not just because of the state's leftward trend.\n\n\"Half my friends are conservative, and about probably half of them are liberal,\" says Ms. Chandler. She credits her ability to get along with both sides to her being a teacher.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Many Republicans are coming to Washington excited to carry out President-elect Donald Trump's agenda. Meanwhile, Democrats are wrestling with how to define themselves in the wake of Vice President Kamala Harris' defeat.\n\nBut it's not just party allegiance that will shape the new Congress. Each member's background and identity will help define legislative trends for the next two years.\n\nHere are seven incoming lawmakers to watch, reflecting the competing ideologies and priorities of members of the new session:\n\nA mélange of new members will join the 119th Congress. Here are seven who are poised to make their mark - and who symbolize larger political forces that will shape the legislative branch.\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Addison McDowell, incoming member of the House, was endorsed by Donald Trump and campaigned with Donald Trump Jr. He plans to spend his time in Congress working to advance Mr. Trump's agenda.\n\nHe joins other freshman Republicans - notably Brandon Gill of Texas, Brian Jack of Georgia, and Riley Moore of West Virginia - who are staunch advocates of Mr. Trump's \"America First\" policies. All four are young relative to the average age of their colleagues, with 30-year-old Mr. Gill and nearly 31-year-old Mr. McDowell set to be the second- and third-youngest members, respectively, of the next Congress.\n\nWhile these freshmen haven't formed an official coalition, Mr. Jack told the Washington Examiner they became \"fast friends\" during the Republican National Convention last summer. Their friendship is drawing comparisons to the Democratic \"Squad\" in the House of Representatives, a progressive coalition made up of young, mostly female House Democrats. That contrast reflects a broader political divide around age and gender. Mr. Trump improved his margins with young men in this past election, and the gender gap between men and women under 30 outranked the divide for all other age groups.\n\nIn November 2024, voters in Kristen McDonald Rivet's Michigan district supported Donald Trump. But they also elected her - a Democrat - for the U.S. House by almost seven points. She says she pulled off this win by focusing on voters' basic needs. In a postelection interview with The New York Times, Ms. McDonald Rivet said her campaign focused \"continuously - almost exclusively - on pocketbook issues.\"\n\nIn the wake of the election, Democrats have offered a bevy of different theories as to how, if at all, the party should adjust its messaging after Vice President Harris' defeat. Ms. McDonald Rivet joins moderate voices who believe the party must do a better job of listening to rural and working-class voters. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Washington Democrat who also won in a rural, conservative district, told the Times that \"the fundamental mistake people make is condescension.\"\n\nJeff Hurd beat the Democrat who was supposed to beat Rep. Lauren Boebert. Colorado Democrat Adam Frisch had been amassing money after losing to Ms. Boebert by fewer than 600 votes in 2022. But at the end of 2023, Ms. Boebert suddenly switched congressional districts, going on to win her race. That opened the field for Mr. Hurd, a Republican, who won in spite of Mr. Frisch's significant fundraising advantage.\n\nHowever, his campaign displayed a very different style from that of Ms. Boebert. While she is known for provocations, including an incident in which she was kicked out of a theater for disruptive behavior, Mr. Hurd's campaign website said the district's leader should be focused on \"avoiding the angry and cynical kind of politics that wears people down.\"\n\nSince winning, Mr. Hurd has said he will advocate for similar priorities as Ms. Boebert. However, he has also said he wants to wait and see what some of Mr. Trump's specific policy plans will be before committing to them - a contrast with Ms. Boebert's full-throated support of the president-elect.\n\nDemocrat Sarah McBride says she didn't come to Washington to pick a fight. The first openly transgender member of Congress got one anyway. Less than two weeks after Ms. McBride won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, Republican Rep. Nancy Mace introduced a resolution requiring members to use bathrooms \"corresponding to their biological sex\" - which would prohibit Ms. McBride from using the women's restroom at the Capitol.\n\nDays later, Speaker Mike Johnson made this a House policy. In a response posted online, Ms. McBride said she would follow Mr. Johnson's rules, saying, \"I'm not here to fight about bathrooms. I'm here to fight for Delawareans.\"\n\nHer response garnered respect from many of her colleagues, but also angered some on the left, who had hoped the congresswoman would use her platform to advocate for the transgender community. Ms. McBride's election comes as the question of transgender policy is flooding political discourse. Mr. Trump made it a central part of his campaign.\n\nFor the first time in history, the U.S. Senate will have two Black women serving simultaneously - Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland. Ms. Alsobrooks was mentored by another groundbreaking woman of color - Kamala Harris, whom she calls her \"quintessential big sister.\" Similarly to Ms. Harris, Ms. Alsobrooks downplayed race and gender in her campaign, saying her working-class background is what would make her election historic if she won.\n\nOthers have been more vocal about the impact of this new diversity in the Senate. The Congressional Black Caucus highlighted Ms. Alsobrooks and Ms. Blunt Rochester in a recent memo , naming them in a list of \"historic victories.\" The caucus, which both women are expected to join, seems poised to be a loud voice opposing key parts of Mr. Trump's agenda in the next few years. One prominent member, Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks, described the caucus to NBC in November as \"the conscience of the Congress, and that's no matter who's in charge.\"\n\nRepublican and former Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy flipped a Montana seat in a close race with Democrat Sen. Jon Tester. Veterans issues were core to his campaign - he said failures in the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan inspired him to run.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nHe criticized what he sees as the lack of military experience in Congress. \"It's not disconnected that we have minimal veteran representation across all of our government ... and we have some of our greatest military disasters, back-to-back-to-back-to-back,\" Mr. Sheehy said last August.\n\nThe number of veterans in Congress has dropped steeply since the Vietnam War, but has seen a slow uptick in recent years - from 92 members in 2021 to 100 this year. Mr. Sheehy will assume a seat on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, which his Democratic predecessor served on in the last Congress.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Not so at Shooters Grill in Rifle, Colo., where owners Lauren and Jayson Boebert, their servers, and many customers carry guns.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated July 06, 2014, 8:27 p.m. ET\n\nMuch of the political and philosophical fight over guns in America is about appearances and perception.\n\nSome gun owners assert their Second Amendment rights by openly (and legally) carrying their firearms in public. If the sight of someone walking around town armed with a loaded handgun, rifle, or shotgun - a civilian, not a law enforcement officer - is startling, then so be it. The point has been made.\n\nMeanwhile, gun control advocates, stymied in their efforts to get Congress to pass stricter measures, have been pressuring major commercial establishments to ask their gun-toting patrons to leave the weaponry at home.\n\nTarget, one of the largest US retailers, is the latest to respond to a signature-gathering effort - 400,000 names - organized by a group called \"Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America,\" which was formed in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Connecticut.\n\nTarget thus joins Chili's, Starbucks, Chipotle, Sonic, and Jack in the Box in asking customers to not bring firearms into their establishments.\n\n\"We've listened carefully to the nuances of this debate and respect the protected rights of everyone involved,\" Target CEO John Mulligan explained on the company blog the other day. \"In return, we are asking for help in fulfilling our goal to create an atmosphere that is safe and inviting for our guests and team members.\"\n\nThen there's Shooters Grill in Rifle, Colo.\n\nAt Shooters, open display of firearms is encouraged. A sign on the front door reads, \"Guns are welcome on premises. Please keep all weapons holstered, unless the need arises. In such cases, judicious marksmanship is appreciated.\"\n\nOwners Lauren and Jayson Boebert carry guns on the job, as do the servers.\n\nAs the local newspaper, The Post Independent, puts it: \"When waitress Ashlee Saenz takes your order at Shooters Grill in Rifle, she not only carries a pad and pen - she also packs a loaded Ruger .357 Blackhawk handgun holstered on her leg, Old West style. It's loaded and she knows how to use it.\"\n\nThere may be an Old West style to the grill's décor and menu (half-pound Angus beef burgers are very popular) but the business plan is New West and apparently successful. So successful that on Sunday morning, the Boeberts posted this on their Facebook page:\n\n\"Alright folks!!! After having 7 deliveries in 5 days we are SOLD OUT OF FOOD!! We have breakfast items, but we cannot supply the quality of food which we normal have for lunch. We do not want anyone to be cut short on the quality/presentation of their meal. So TODAY WE CLOSING AT 11:00am!!! We will get a new delivery tomorrow at 5am. So come in hungry and we will feed you right!! Have a great day everyone!\"\n\nThe restaurant also hosts concealed carry training that qualifies customers for Colorado and Utah permits. The $75 price tag includes dinner.\n\nAs she explained it to the local newspaper, Boebert said she is simply allowing customers and employees to exercise their constitutional right.\n\n\"We encourage it, and the customers love that they can come here and express their rights,\" she said. \"This country was founded on our freedom. People can come in carrying their gun, and they can pray over their food.\"\n\n\"I consulted with my Christian friends and everyone said 'Shooters' sounded like a bar or a strip joint,\" Ms. Boebert said. \"But I thought, this is Rifle - it was founded around guns and the Old West. We called it Shooters and started throwing guns and Jesus all over the place.\"\n\nThe restaurant does not serve alcohol, which makes local law enforcement officials happy.\n\n\"If it was a bar, I might be saying something different. But I have no problem with it,\" Police Chief John Dyer told the Post Independent. \"And besides, they make a really good burger.\"\n\nSays Garfield County Sheriff Lou Vallario, \"Guns and alcohol, just like alcohol and driving, are not a good mix together.\"\n\n\"This is a complicated issue,\" Mr. Mulligan, the Target CEO (whose company logo is a bull's-eye), wrote in his blog post, \"but it boils down to a simple belief: Bringing firearms to Target creates an environment that is at odds with the family-friendly shopping and work experience we strive to create.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nNot so, says Lauren Boebert, who notes that some customers think the guns are just part of a costume designed to fit in with the Western motif.\n\n\"No, they're real and they're loaded, and we know what we're doing,\" she says. \"I fear for anyone who tries to rob us.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

For a week, conservative media outlets spread the lie that President Joe Biden wants to limit Americans to one hamburger a month as part of his climate agenda.\n\nLoading...\n\nApril 29, 2021, 11:47 a.m. ET | New York\n\nPresident Joe Biden spent only a weekend as the \"Hamburglar\" in the conservative media world.\n\nBut while the false story lasted, it moved with a damaging speed and breadth, another example of a closed ecosystem of information affecting public opinion.\n\nAn academic study published a year before Mr. Biden became president was used to speculate that he would place limits on how much red meat Americans can consume as part of his stated goal to sharply reduce greenhouse gas pollution.\n\nIt was a potentially potent, visceral argument with punchy cable TV octane, namely that Mr. Biden was trying to limit people to eating one hamburger a month - an allegation that could seriously undermine his climate change plan before he even announced it.\n\nThere was one main problem: He's said no such thing.\n\nYet two days after the Daily Mail brought up the topic in a report last Thursday, Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Colorado Republican, was tweeting, \"Why doesn't Joe stay out of my kitchen?\"\n\nThe Mail's story, by Emily Crane, was headlined \"How Biden's climate plan could limit you to eat just one burger a MONTH, cost $3.5K a year per person in taxes, force you to spend $55K on an electric car and 'crush' American jobs.\"\n\nMs. Crane cited a January 2020 study by the University of Michigan's Center for Sustainable Systems, which discussed how a transition to a more plant-based diet by Americans could cut down on greenhouse gas emissions. The paper estimated the environmental impact of a 90% reduction in beef consumption.\n\nMartin Heller, a research specialist at Michigan and one of the study's authors, said there was no connection between the research and Mr. Biden's plans.\n\n\"The conversation so quickly gets pushed to these extremes and I think that's an effort at poking at people's fears,\" Mr. Heller said. \"That's the frustrating part to me - that we can't have a conversation about how to get creative in this sort of middle space.\"\n\nThe Britain-based Daily Mail defended its story while criticizing others in the media.\n\n\"President Biden has announced an e xtremely ambitious target for carbon emissions reduction that will have a massive effect on the American economy and way of life without giving a single detail of how he expects to achieve it,\" a newspaper spokesperson said.\n\n\"Unlike the rest of the overwhelmingly White House-whipped American media, the Mail attempted to explore this gaping hole at the center of the president's announcement,\" the representative said.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Biden has discussed several initiatives to help reach his climate goals, including increasing the use of wind and solar power and slashing emissions from fossil fuels such as coal and oil.\n\nThe newspaper's spokesperson said that \"we made it very clear these were steps that MIGHT have to be taken.\"\n\nBut as the story spread, the qualifiers were deemphasized or disappeared entirely.\n\nThe conservative website Gateway Pundit ran a story Friday with the headline \"Biden's climate requirements: cut 90 percent of red meat from diet; Americans can only eat one burger per month.\"\n\nThe body of the story itself was less incendiary, quoting the Daily Mail and using the qualifier \"could.\"\n\nWhile a graphic on Friday's \"Fox & Friends\" talked about what will be required to meet Mr. Biden's green targets, host Ainsley Earhardt said, \"He wants to cut out 90% of the red meat that you all eat.\"\n\nLater, Fox News anchor John Roberts said: \"Say goodbye to your burgers if you want to sign up for the Biden climate agenda. That's the finding of one study.\"\n\nA graphic onscreen, with a picture of a cheeseburger, read: \"Up in your grill. Biden's climate requirements: cut 90 percent of red meat from diet, max 4 lbs. per year, one burger per month.\"\n\nThe story spread rapidly on social media. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted Fox's \"Up in your grill\" graphic, adding, \"Not gonna happen in Texas!\" Idaho Gov. Brad Little retweeted Mr. Abbott, adding, \"Idahoans also have beef with this agenda and for dinner!\"\n\nIt was Republican Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene who dubbed Mr. Biden \"The Hamburglar,\" a reference to a character in McDonald's commercials.\n\nThere were some 23,000 examples of terms like Mr. Biden's climate plan, requirements, or mandates appearing together with \"meat consumption\" in the context of political conversations online between Thursday and Monday, according to the media intelligence firm Zignal Labs. \"Red meat\" also had some 59,000 mentions in political chatter.\n\n\"This is pure propaganda,\" said Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University communications professor who specializes in disinformation.\n\nThere is little incentive for politicians and others to check their facts before posting on popular social media platforms, and those platforms aren't doing it for them, Ms. Grygiel said.\n\nOnce the false claim gets into people's heads, it's hard to dislodge. Many targets of the story are unlikely to see fact-checks, said John Cook, a research fellow at the Monash Climate Change Communication Research Hub.\n\nRepublicans have been frustrated in trying to find lines of attack that will stick against Mr. Biden in his first 100 days in office. Many in the conservative media world have also continued to spread lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election.\n\nAlso this past weekend, the New York Post reported that migrant children entering the United States across the southern border were getting copies of a book from Vice President Kamala Harris in a welcome kit. The Post has since corrected the story to say there has been only one known time that a migrant child got Ms. Harris' book.\n\nThe reporter who wrote the Post story, Laura Italiano, tweeted late Tuesday that she had resigned from the paper. She called the article \" an incorrect story I was ordered to write and which I failed to push back hard against.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Biden spokesman Mike Gwin posted on Twitter a photo of a smiling Mr. Biden grilling steaks at a campaign stop, and linked to a CNN fact-checker who called claims about the president proposing limits on meat consumption \"completely imaginary.\"\n\nThe Daily Mail on Monday updated its story on Mr. Biden's climate control plans without saying what was done. The headline did not change, and a spokesperson said it was for \"minor cosmetic reasons.\"\n\nOn Fox, meanwhile, Mr. Roberts told viewers that while the network correctly presented data from the Michigan study, \"a graphic and the script incorrectly implied it was part of Biden's plan for dealing with climate change. That is not the case.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

A record number of them are heading to Congress - with more races still to be called. Of the eight House seats flipped by Republicans, six have been by women.\n\n\"I've been saying 2018 is the year of the woman, and 2020 is the year of the Republican woman,\" says Olivia Perez-Cubas, spokeswoman for Winning for Women Action Fund, the first super political action committee dedicated to electing Republican women.\n\nPart of the reason for their strong performance is the good political environment for women candidates, with Republican women inspired by the Democratic women's wave, as well as by women in Republican leadership positions, such as atop the Republican National Committee. Experts on women in politics say there's a motivational effect of women running for office that crosses party lines. \"If you can see it, you can be it,\" as Ms. Perez-Cubas puts it.\n\nTwo years ago, gains by Democrats in Congress were paired with the label \"the year of the woman.\" Now 2020 brings its own new gains for gender diversity - this time on the other side of the political aisle.\n\nThese women - so far 24 in the House and eight in the Senate - were also poised to benefit from what turned out to be unprecedented turnout for President Donald Trump.\n\nThey could not have been elected had they not been on the ballot in the first place. This year, a record 227 GOP women jumped into the pipeline to run for the House, with 94 making it past the primaries to the general election, nearly double from the prior cycle. Primaries are a big hurdle for GOP women, due to fundraising and the stereotype that women are less conservative than men, but this time Republican women focused on helping female candidates win those early contests.\n\n\"What happened this year, they were inspired ... and they were more strategic,\" says Dianne Bystrom, co-president of the League of Women Voters in Nebraska.\n\nThe newcomers come from mixed backgrounds. Georgia's Marjorie Taylor Greene made headlines for her support of the QAnon conspiracy theory, while Colorado's Lauren Boebert owns a gun-themed restaurant that defied pandemic shutdown orders and where servers openly carry firearms. In Florida, Maria Elvira Salazar is a longtime journalist who worked for the Spanish-language network Telemundo. She flipped her district, as did Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma, Michelle Fischbach of Minnesota, and Nancy Mace of South Carolina, all of whom had served before in their statehouses, with Ms. Fischbach a former lieutenant governor. Meanwhile, Cynthia Lummis will be the first woman to represent Wyoming in the U.S. Senate. She is an attorney and former state lawmaker.\n\n\"The lesson here is that if you want more Republican women to serve and win, there have to be more Republican women on the ballot,\" says Kelly Dittmar, research director at the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University in New Jersey. That's obvious, she says, but not easy to achieve for a party that eschews identity politics and lags far behind Democrats in targeted financial support for female candidates.\n\nBut two years ago, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York and a cast of other Republican women took this challenge into their own hands. They had just witnessed 2018's blue wave reduce their numbers from 23 congresswomen to 13. The contrast on swearing-in day was striking: the Republican side a mass of dark suits with red ties, the Democrats a cornucopia of lively colors worn by a record-setting 89 female members.\n\nRepresentative Stefanik, the youngest GOP woman in the House, called the lack of Republican women a \"crisis.\" As the first woman to head up recruiting for House Republicans that cycle, she convinced more than 100 women to run, but only one was elected. So she changed her strategy - quitting her official recruitment role and relaunching her political action committee, known as E-PAC, so she could focus on endorsing and financially supporting women in primaries. That's something the national party steers clear of, even while primaries are the toughest hurdle for GOP women.\n\nHer move was at first called a \"mistake\" by the head of the House's Republican campaign arm, Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota. But Ms. Stefanik was not cowed. \"NEWSFLASH: I wasn't asking for permission,\" she tweeted, with siren emojis. Other women stepped up, including this cycle's House GOP recruitment head, retiring Rep. Susan Brooks of Indiana. They put in hours on the phone recruiting and mentoring female candidates, guiding them through everything from budgeting to the media to managing family life in Congress. \"If Elise had not stepped forward ... I don't think we would have had the success that we had,\" says former Rep. Mimi Walters of California, who lost to Democrat Katie Porter in 2018. \"It was something Elise did on her own. It was not the party saying, 'Go do this.' It was Elise saying, 'I am going to do this.'\"\n\nMs. Walters praises Ms. Stefanik for her PAC, explaining that it's typically harder for women to raise money, which discourages them from running. But \"that dynamic is changing,\" she says, mentioning other funding sources for GOP women, such as VIEW PAC, a political action committee that's more than 20 years old, and the newly formed Winning for Women Action Fund, which was formed after the 2018 congressional losses.\n\n\"We asked ourselves, why is this happening, why aren't women getting over the finish line?\" recalls Ms. Perez-Cubas, of the Winning for Women Action Fund. One conclusion: \"There's a big hole in the Republican Party ecosystem.\" Now it's starting to be filled with the first super PAC - with no limit on fundraising - directed solely at GOP women candidates. This cycle, the PAC spent nearly $3 million.\n\nBut Democrats dwarf the efforts of their Republican counterparts. For instance, EMILY's List, which recruits and supports pro-choice female candidates at all levels of government from start to finish, raised $72 million this cycle. So far this year, Democrats have elected 103 women to the House and Senate (slightly behind their 2018 record). They also shattered the glass ceiling in the vice president's office, electing the first Black woman and first person of South Asian descent.\n\n\"The left does a really good job of elevating women,\" says Ms. Perez-Cubas, a former aide to Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. \"We have to make sure [we] go toe to toe.\"\n\nGetting more Republican women elected challenges monolithic conceptions about what women believe, says Ms. Dittmar, and brings diversity of style, perspective, and experience to governing - not to mention a more equal representation of constituents. But it's also important for the future of the party, for its image and its ongoing battle for suburban women voters.\n\nIn California's Orange County, once a bedrock of Republicanism, GOP women are leading in two very tight races to win back House seats that Democrats flipped in 2018. Young Kim was the first Korean American Republican woman elected to the state legislature; Michelle Steel, also a Korean American, is a county supervisor.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Jim Jordan had been trying to achieve the same thing.\n\nTexting with then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, a close ally and friend, at nearly midnight on Jan. 5, Mr. Jordan offered a legal rationale for what President Donald Trump was publicly demanding - that Vice President Mike Pence, in his ceremonial role presiding over the electoral count, somehow assert the authority to reject electors from Biden-won states.\n\nMr. Pence \"should call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all,\" Mr. Jordan wrote.\n\n\"I have pushed for this,\" Mr. Meadows replied. \"Not sure it is going to happen.\"\n\nThe text exchange, in an April 22 court filing from the congressional panel investigating the Jan. 6 riot, is in a batch of startling evidence that shows the deep involvement of some House Republicans in Mr. Trump's desperate attempt to stay in power. A review of the evidence finds new details about how, long before the attack on the Capitol unfolded, several GOP lawmakers were participating directly in Mr. Trump's campaign to reverse the results of a free and fair election.\n\nIt's a connection that members of the House Jan. 6 committee are making explicit as they prepare to launch public hearings in June. The Republicans plotting with Mr. Trump and the rioters who attacked the Capitol were aligned in their goals, if not the mob's violent tactics, creating a convergence that nearly upended the nation's peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\"It appears that a significant number of House members and a few senators had more than just a passing role in what went on,\" Rep. Bennie Thompson, the Democratic chairman of the Jan. 6 committee, told The Associated Press last week.\n\nSince launching its investigation last summer, the Jan. 6 panel has been slowly gaining new details about what lawmakers said and did in the weeks before the insurrection. Members have asked three GOP lawmakers - Mr. Jordan of Ohio, Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California - to testify voluntarily. All have refused. Other lawmakers could be called in the coming days.\n\nSo far, the Jan. 6 committee has refrained from issuing subpoenas to lawmakers, fearing the repercussions of such an extraordinary step. But the lack of cooperation from lawmakers hasn't prevented the panel from obtaining new information about their actions.\n\nThe latest court document, submitted in response to a lawsuit from Mr. Meadows, contained excerpts from just a handful of the more than 930 interviews the Jan. 6 panel has conducted. It includes information on several high-level meetings nearly a dozen House Republicans attended where Mr. Trump's allies flirted with ways to give him another term.\n\nAmong the ideas: naming fake slates of electors in seven swing states, declaring martial law, and seizing voting machines.\n\nThe efforts started in the weeks after The Associated Press declared Mr. Biden president-elect.\n\nIn early December 2020, several lawmakers attended a meeting in the White House counsel's office where attorneys for the president advised them that a plan to put up an alternate slate of electors declaring Mr. Trump the winner was not \"legally sound.\" One lawmaker, Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, pushed back on that position. So did GOP Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida and Louie Gohmert of Texas, according to testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson, a former special assistant in the Trump White House.\n\nDespite the warning from the counsel's office, Mr. Trump's allies moved forward. On Dec. 14, 2020, as rightly chosen Democratic electors in seven states - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, New Mexico, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin - met at their seat of state government to cast their votes, the fake electors gathered as well.\n\nThey declared themselves the rightful electors and submitted false Electoral College certificates declaring Mr. Trump the true winner of the presidential election in their states.\n\nThose certificates from the \"alternate electors\" were then sent to Congress, where they were ignored.\n\nThe majority of the lawmakers have since denied their involvement in these efforts.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia testified in a hearing in April that she does not recall conversations she had with the White House or the texts she sent to Mr. Meadows about Mr. Trump invoking martial law.\n\nMr. Gohmert told AP he also does not recall being involved and that he is not sure he could be helpful to the committee's investigation. Rep. Jody Hice of Georgia played down his actions, saying it is routine for members of the president's party to be going in and out of the White House to speak about a number of topics. Mr. Hice is now running for secretary of state in Georgia, a position responsible for the state's elections.\n\nRep. Andy Biggs of Arizona didn't deny his public efforts to challenge the election results but called recent reports about his deeper involvement untrue.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona reiterated his \"serious\" concerns about the 2020 election. \"Discussions about the Electoral Count Act were appropriate, necessary and warranted,\" he added.\n\nRequests for comment from the other lawmakers were not immediately returned.\n\nLess than a week later after the early December meeting at the White House, another plan emerged. In a meeting with House Freedom Caucus members and Trump White House officials, the discussion turned to the decisive action they believed that Mr. Pence could take on Jan. 6.\n\nThose in attendance virtually and in-person, according to committee testimony, were Reps. Hice, Biggs, Gosar, Perry, Gaetz, Jordan, Gohmert, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Debbie Lesko of Arizona, and Greene, then a congresswoman-elect.\n\n\"What was the conversation like?\" the committee asked Ms. Hutchinson, who was a frequent presence in the meetings that took place in December 2020 and January 2021.\n\n\"They felt that he had the authority to, pardon me if my phrasing isn't correct on this, but - send votes back to the States or the electors back to the states,\" Ms. Hutchinson said, referring to Mr. Pence.\n\nWhen asked if any of the lawmakers disagreed with the idea that the vice president had such authority, Ms. Hutchinson said there was no objection from any of the Republican lawmakers.\n\nIn another meeting about Mr. Pence's potential role, Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, and Jenna Ellis were joined again by Mr. Perry and Mr. Jordan as well as Ms. Greene and Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican who had also just been elected to the House from Colorado.\n\nCommunication between lawmakers and the White House didn't let up as Jan. 6 drew closer. The day after Christmas, Mr. Perry texted Mr. Meadows with a countdown.\n\n\"11 days to 1/6 and 25 days to inauguration,\" the text read. \"We gotta get going!\" Mr. Perry urged Mr. Meadows to call Jeffrey Clark, an assistant attorney general who championed Mr. Trump's efforts to challenge the election results. Mr. Perry has acknowledged introducing Mr. Clark to Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Clark clashed with Justice Department superiors over his plan to send a letter to Georgia and other battleground states questioning the election results and urging their state legislatures to investigate. It all culminated in a dramatic White House meeting at which Mr. Trump considered elevating Mr. Clark to attorney general, only to back down after top Justice Department officials made clear they would resign.\n\nPressure from lawmakers and the White House on the Justice Department is among several areas of inquiry in the Jan. 6 investigation. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democratic member of the panel from Maryland, has hinted there are more revelations to come.\n\n\"As the mob smashed our windows, bloodied our police and stormed the Capitol, Trump and his accomplices plotted to destroy Biden's majority in the electoral college and overthrow our constitutional order,\" Mr. Raskin tweeted last week.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Rural residents are wary of the problems wolves bring, but have waning voting power.\n\nLoading...\n\nDec. 11, 2023, 11:31 a.m. ET | Denver, Colo.\n\nWildlife officials plan to release gray wolves in Colorado in coming weeks, at the behest of urban voters and to the dismay of rural residents who don't want the predators but have waning influence in the Democratic-led state.\n\nThe most ambitious wolf reintroduction effort in the United States in almost three decades marks a sharp departure from aggressive efforts by Republican-led states to cull wolf packs. More releases planned for Colorado over the next several years will start to fill in one of the last remaining major gaps in the western U.S. for a species that historically ranged from northern Canada to the desert southwest.\n\nThe reintroduction, starting with the release of up to 10 wolves, emerged as a political wedge issue when GOP-dominated Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana refused to share their wolves for the effort. Colorado officials ultimately turned to another Democratic state - Oregon - to secure wolves.\n\nAs anticipation grows among wildlife advocates, who've already started a wolf-naming contest, ranchers in the Rocky Mountains where the releases will occur are anxious. They've already seen glimpses of what the future could hold as a handful of wolves that wandered down from Wyoming over the past two years killed livestock.\n\nThe fear is such attacks will worsen, adding to a spate of perceived assaults on western Colorado's rural communities as the state's liberal leaders embrace clean energy and tourism, eclipsing economic mainstays such as fossil fuel extraction and agriculture.\n\nEspecially grating for rancher Don Gittleson is that his fellow Colorado residents invited the reintroduction through their narrow approval of a 2020 ballot measure. Suburbs and cities along Colorado's Front Range, which includes Denver, carried the vote despite strong opposition across less-densely populated counties where the wolves will be released - the home district of conservative Republican firebrand Rep. Lauren Boebert.\n\n\"It was the cities that voted for it, and most of them can't tell the difference between a wolf or a coyote or a dog,\" said Mr. Gittleson, who lost at least six cows and calves to wolves from his Sherman Creek Ranch in northern Colorado over the past couple years - among the first documented wolf attacks in the state in more than 70 years.\n\nIn 2022, gray wolves attacked domesticated animals hundreds of times across 10 states in the contiguous U.S. including Colorado, according to an Associated Press review of depredation data from state and federal agencies. Attacks killed or injured at least 425 cattle and calves, 313 sheep and lambs, 40 dogs, 10 chickens, five horses, and four goats, according to the data. Other times livestock simply goes missing, such as two calves that Mr. Gittleson said disappeared after wolves had passed through.\n\nSuch losses can be devastating to individual ranchers or pet owners. However, their industry-wide impact is negligible: The number of cattle killed or injured in the documented cases equals 0.002% of herds in the affected states, according to a comparison of depredation data with state livestock inventories.\n\n\"95% of ranchers in Colorado will never have a problem,\" said Ed Bangs, a former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist who led the reintroduction of wolves in the mid-1990s to Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho. \"4.5% will have the occasional problem every couple of years maybe, and maybe one or two guys will have a problem like every other year. I don't think it's enough to put them out of business.\"\n\n\"But if it was my cattle and my business, I'd be pissed,\" he added.\n\nOpposition to wolves is being used as a political bludgeon by elected officials such as Ms. Boebert, who sponsored legislation to lift remaining federal protections for wolves. That may not significantly sway an election but it's a boon \"for candidates like Boebert to rally behind, I think for want of another issue, to gin up cultural resentments.\" said Seth Masket, director of the Center on American Politics at the University of Denver.\n\nColorado wildlife officials anticipate releasing 30 to 50 wolves within the next five years.\n\nTo allay livestock industry fears, ranchers who lose livestock or herding and guard animals to wolf attacks will be paid fair market value, up to $15,000 per animal. Meanwhile, Colorado residents who backed the reintroduction are going to have to get used to wildlife agents killing wolves that prey on livestock.\n\nAlready some wolves have been killed when they crossed from Colorado into Wyoming, which has a \"predatory\" zone for wolves covering most of the state where they can be shot on sight.\n\nThe roiling political debates over the predator have been divorced from the details on the ground, said Matt Barnes, a range scientist focusing on preventing conflict between carnivores and ranchers. The former rancher argued that there's a \"middle ground\" where agriculture and wildlife can inhabit the same landscape.\n\n\"People are really arguing not so much about the animals themselves, or even the land, but underlying worldviews about how humans fit into a more than human world,\" said Mr. Barnes.\n\nColorado officials have a detailed strategy to deter wolves from livestock, including blinking lights that hang along fence lines and propane cannons that make frightening sonic blasts. Another method is tying fabric streamers to fences to make wolves wary of crossing onto ranches. The predators eventually get used to such deterrents, so they are used for relatively short periods of time.\n\nGray wolves were exterminated across most of the U.S. by the 1930s under government-sponsored poisoning and trapping campaigns. They received endangered species protections in 1975, when there were about 1,000 left, in northern Minnesota.\n\nThere's been no turning back for other states where gray wolves have become reestablished. An estimated 7,500 wolves in about 1,400 packs now roam parts of the contiguous U.S. Populations are expanding most rapidly in Oregon and Washington - Democratic states that wolves are naturally recolonizing after being reintroduced to neighboring states.\n\nIn Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming, where wolf hunting is legal, Republican-dominated legislatures have sought to drive down wolf numbers by loosening rules for killing the predators and increasing the number that can be taken by individual hunters. That led to more Yellowstone wolves being shot but had a minor impact on overall wolf numbers. State officials say it's helped reduce attacks on livestock as wolves become more wary of humans.\n\nThe stepped up killing also drew attention from President Joe Biden's administration, which is considering restoring federal wolf protections in the states in response to laws that made it much easier to kill the predators. It's the only region of the U.S. where wolves are not currently federally protected.\n\nInterior officials have sought for a decade - beginning under former President Barack Obama - to remove protections for wolves across the remainder of the contiguous U.S. That finally happened under former President Donald Trump, until a federal court struck down the action.\n\nA new proposal is due by early February. If wolves lose their protected status, it would open the door to future hunts for the predators in Colorado and elsewhere, with each state to decide.\n\nNear Mr. Gittleson's Sherman Creek Ranch, Brian Anderson found three of his lambs dead last month on his family's ranch. One was partially eaten, the other two seemingly untouched save for blood stains in their wool.\n\nMr. Anderson will be reimbursed, likely for the market rate of about $300 per animal, he said, but \"the monetary value isn't what's important to me. ... I have three customers now this year that aren't going to get a lamb.\"\n\nStill, he's less concerned about the long-term impacts on ranching assuming people get paid when livestock get killed.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Ken Buck, R-Colo.-lashing out at party officials over a \"backroom deal\" that could lose her critical Republican Party support and jeopardize her chances of winning in his district in November.\n\nBoebert called Buck's early retirement a \"swampy backroom deal to try to rig an election.\"\n\nBoebert represents Colorado's third district-but she only narrowly won by less than 600 votes in 2022 in a region that typically leans Republican.\n\nIn December, Boebert announced she would switch districts and run in Buck's fourth district in November 2024, shortly after he announced his retirement in November.\n\nHowever, Buck announced yesterday he would leave Congress even earlier next week, forcing Colorado to hold a special election to select a representative to serve out the remainder of his term.\n\nRepublicans will nominate a single candidate for the special election, which was scheduled for June 25-the same day as the Republican primary for the seat-potentially giving more resources and institutional backing to that one candidate in a crowded field of nine contenders.\n\nIn order to run in the special election to replace him, Boebert would be forced to also resign her seat, cutting the Republicans' razor-thin majority to just four votes.\n\nBoebert said she still plans to run in the primary election for Buck's seat, but will not seek the Republican nomination for the special election-potentially confusing voters, who may want to vote for the same candidate to continue through November.\n\nBoebert announced her decision not to run in the special election on Wednesday, lashing out at the special election process and calling Buck's retirement \"a gift to the uniparty\" and promised to serve out the rest of her term in the third district. \"The establishment concocted a swampy backroom deal to try to rig an election I'm winning by 25 points,\" she said in a post on X , referring to an early poll that shows her polling at about 32 percent, with the majority undecided.\n\nBoebert was first elected to congress in 2020 and quickly became one of former President Trump's loudest supporters in the House. However, her first term was marred by controversies and stunts, including calling Muslim Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., a \"terrorist,\" introducing a bill to make the AR-15 the \"national gun\" and heckling President Joe Biden during a State of the Union address while he was speaking about soldiers injured during the Iraq War. Voters appeared fed up with Boebert's antics during her reelection campaign in 2022-the firebrand congresswoman lost about 57,000 voters from her first election, and narrowly defeated Democrat Adam Frisch by only 546 votes. Her second term has proved no less controversial. Boebert was kicked out of a Denver performance of \"Beetlejuice\" for rude behavior, which she later apologized for and blamed on her \"public and difficult divorce\" and \"challenging personal time for me and my entire family.\" Boebert's ex-husband was later charged with assault after the pair reportedly got in a fight outside a Colorado restaurant in January. The congresswoman was also briefly investigated for assault, but the investigation was dismissed days later. In February, her 18-year-old son was arrested and charged with multiple misdemeanors and felonies."

Last month, Buck announced plans to end his term early, forcing a special election for his seat to serve out the remainder of the ongoing Congressional term. After lashing out at her party's leadership for making a \"backroom deal\" on the matter, Boebert said she would not run in the special election, as such a move would require her to vacate her current seat. This a blow to Boebert's chances for November as the special election for Buck's vacated seat will be held alongside the party's primary for the same Congressional district for the November election. This could potentially affect her vote count in the primary as voters may choose to pick the same candidate for both the special election and the primary.\n\nRep.

More district.\n\nPolice in Rifle, Colorado said Boebert, 18, was arrested in connection to a \"recent string of vehicle trespass and property thefts in Rifle.\"\n\nBoebert is facing a total of 22 charges, according to arrest records from the Garfield County Sheriff's Office, including conspiracy to commit a felony, four counts of criminal possession of identification documents and four counts of criminal possession of financial devices, as well as more than a dozen misdemeanors, including criminal trespassing, contributing to the delinquency of a minor and theft of less than $300.\n\nUnder Colorado's criminal code, conspiracy and criminal possession of more than two identification documents are considered felonies.\n\nThe Rifle Police Department said no further information would be released while the investigation is ongoing, and Rep. Boebert did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Forbes.\n\nTuesday's charges against Tyler Boebert are only the latest arrest in the embattled congresswoman's family in 2024 so far. In January, Boebert's ex-husband Jayson Boebert was charged with assault , disorderly conduct, criminal trespass, and obstructing a peace officer for two fights in early January-one with the couple's 18-year-old son, and another with the congresswoman at a restaurant in Silt, Colorado. The congresswoman was also briefly investigated after her ex-husband claimed she punched him in the face, but police later dismissed the allegations due to a \"lack of any evidence.\" Boebert has since been granted a temporary restraining order against Jayson.\n\nThe turmoil in Boebert's personal life comes as the firebrand congresswoman attempts to run for re-election in a new district. Boebert was first elected to congress in 2020 in Colorado's 3rd district, a Republican-leaning region situated in the western and southern portions of the state. Although the district still leans Republican, Boebert was only narrowly re-elected in 2022, beating her Democratic rival Adam Frisch by less than 600 votes. In December 2023, Boebert announced that she would be moving to Colorado's 4th district instead-a safer Republican district, whose longtime Rep. Ken Buck announced his retirement in November 2023. \"It's the right move for me personally, and it's the right decision for those who support our conservative movement. This is the right move for Colorado, for us,\" Boebert said in her announcement video. She said the move was partially motivated by the \"difficult year for me and my family,\" but also blamed the \"Hollywood elites\" she accused of targeting her in the 2022 election."

Boebert's team for comment and was unable to contact Jayson Boebert for comment.\n\nJayson Boebert was also taken into custody Tuesday for an incident that occurred early that morning between him and his son, the Denver Post reported . Garfield County deputies issued a warrant for assault, harassment and prohibited use of a firearm. One of their sons told police that Boebert came home drunk, began to argue with him and a \"physical altercation\" began, the Post reported.\n\nAfter the Saturday incident in Silt, Rep. Boebert's team released a statement saying she \"didn't punch Jayson in the face,\" adding she would \"evaluate all of (her) legal options.\" Police said when they responded to the call, Jayson was \"highly intoxicated, yelling at officers and was uncooperative with the investigation,\" and officials said he had to be removed from the restaurant by law enforcement after refusing to leave. He told the Denver Post on Sunday he did not want to press charges against his ex-wife and that they were \"working through a difficult conversation.\" Rep. Boebert filed for divorce from Jayson for \"irreconcilable differences\" in May, 2023, after they had been together for nearly two decades, according to the Colorado Sun."

In Michigan, Democratic candidate Hillary Scholten defeated Trump-backed John Gibbs in a race to replace Rep. Peter Meijer (R-Mich.)-who voted to impeach Trump after the January 6 Capitol riot and lost in his primary bid to Gibbs. Democrats also flipped Rep. Steve Chabot's (R-Ohio) seat, while incumbents Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) and Susan Wild (D-Pa.) edged out Republicans in competitive races. Republicans were able to flip seats in Virginia's 2nd District and in New York, where Republican candidate Michael Lawler ousted Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Republican George Santos flipped the state's 3rd District red.\n\nSince her election in 2020, Boebert has faced widespread criticism for rejecting Covid-era mask mandates, claiming she can carry a gun inside the Capitol complex, spreading a debunked theory that schools are providing litter boxes for students that dress up as \"furries\" and for promoting Trump's baseless theory that the 2020 election was stolen from him. At the State of the Union in January, Boebert heckled President Joe Biden when he was speaking about soldiers who suffer from toxic exposure injuries at military burn pits in Afghanistan and Iraq, including his late son, Beau, who died of cancer.\n\nAs of noon on Wednesday, neither chamber of Congress has been decided, although the GOP is expected to win the House, even if Boebert loses.

She also made headlines for spreading the baseless theory that elementary schools provide litter boxes for students that identify as animals and dress up as \"furries\"-a theory that's drawn condemnation from LGBTQ advocacy groups who argue the claim is based in anti-trans ideology.\n\nBoebert blamed the closer-than-expected vote numbers on a low Republican turnout and a lack of support for GOP candidates in Colorado's Senate and gubernatorial races, telling reporters last week, \"I don't know if there wasn't enough enthusiasm for our top ticket candidates for governor and Senate or what happened there,\" the Wall Street Journal reported. She was more optimistic speaking at a campaign event on election night, saying , \"we will have this victory,\" as well as on Thursday when she tweeted, \" Winning! \"\n\n31%.

      "text": "Far-Right Boebert Pulls Ahead Of Long-Shot Opponent In Nail-Biter\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), a far-right Trump ally who's come under fire for spreading conspiracy theories, pulled ahead of her Democratic opponent Adam Frisch by 1,122 votes as a tranche of ballots came in Thursday afternoon and Friday morning, according to the Associated Press, putting the outspoken Trump ally on track to win her second term-although a recount could be coming.\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) tweeted Thursday \"Winning!\"\n\nWith 99% of ballots counted, Boebert leads Frisch for Colorado's 3rd Congressional District with 50.1% of the vote (162,040 to 160,918), according to the Associated Press, erasing Frisch's slim lead, which had him up by just 64 votes Thursday morning.\n\nBoebert, who made national news after rejecting Covid-19 mask mandates and spreading debunked theories, including Trump's baseless claim over 2020 election fraud, had been \"clearly favored\" to win, according to FiveThirtyEight's election model, which simulates the election 40,000 times-with Boebert winning in 97% of those simulations.\n\nAs of 4 a.m. Wednesday, the New York Times had also forecast Boebert to win, according to county-by-county data it uses to determine which candidate will likely take the remainder of the uncounted votes-the Cook Political Report ranks the district solidly Republican.\n\nColorado election law allows candidates to request a recount, and requires one if the difference in votes between the top two candidates is less than half of one percent of the number of ballots cast for the top vote-getter (the 1,122-vote difference puts that percentage at 0.6%, just outside the range of a required recount).\n\nNeither Boebert or Frisch declared victory ahead of the official results, although at a campaign event Tuesday night, Boebert said \"we will have this victory,\" while Frisch attributed the close contest to his \"calm belief that 40% of the Republican party wants their party back.\"\n\nA Boebert loss would be the latest blow to the so-called \" red wave \" that Republicans had hoped to give them control of Congress, following key GOP House losses in North Carolina, Ohio and Michigan, where Trump-backed John Gibbs fell to Democrat Hillary Scholten, as well as the hotly contested Pennsylvania Senate race, which Republican Mehmet Oz lost to Democrat John Fetterman, flipping the seat from red to blue.\n\nBoebert has come under fire since being elected to Congress on a fervently pro-MAGA platform in 2020, after she rejected Covid-era mask mandates at the Capitol building, claimed she can carry a gun inside the Capitol complex, made Islamophobic comments toward Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and spread Trump's baseless theory that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him. Boebert, who previously owned a gun-themed restaurant called Shooters Grill-where wait staff was encouraged to carry a firearm-also faced pressure to resign after she tweeted information about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi while the Capitol was under siege during the January 6 riots. During the January State of the Union, she yelled at President Joe Biden as he was giving a speech on Afghanistan and Iraq veterans who have suffered from toxic exposure from military burn pits. She also spread the baseless theory that elementary schools are providing litter boxes for students that identify as cats and dress up as \"furries,\" saying \"when we have a large portion of the population who can't tell us what a woman is, there's a crisis.\" At a speech last month, she called for a \" Christian takeover ,\" telling her supporters \"you get to have a role in ushering in the second coming of Jesus\"-she previously described the separation of church and state as \" junk .\"\n\nThree Senate races that could determine the balance of the chamber have not yet been called: Nevada, Arizona and Alaska, where Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) faces a challenge from Trump-backed far-right candidate Kelly Tshibaka. Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) and Republican Herschel Walker's hotly contested Senate race is headed to a December runoff after neither candidate surpassed 50% of the vote required to win. The chamber is currently split 48-48. In Nevada, Republican Adam Laxalt has a 49.4%-47.6% lead over incumbent Sen. Catherine Cortez Mastro (D) with 83% of ballots counted, while in Arizona, Sen. Mark Kelly (D) is ahead of Republican Blake Masters 51.4% to 46.4% with 70% of the vote in.\n\nGOP Firebrand Lauren Boebert Struggles To Hang On To Colorado House Seat-Here's Where The Race Stands Now (Forbes)\n\nIn Colorado, Boebert trails her opponent by just a few dozen votes.

      "text": "Lauren Boebert Says Alec Baldwin's Charges Were Dropped Due To 'Liberal Privilege'\n\nRight-wing Rep. Lauren Boebert (Colo.) attributed prosecutors' decision to drop charges against actor Alec Baldwin to \"liberal privilege\" on Friday, adding to the chorus of conservative criticism against Baldwin, who famously parodied former President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live, in the wake of the fatal movie set shooting.\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) attends a news conference with senators and members of the House ... More Freedom Caucus on the debt limit and spending reforms, in the Senate studio of the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, March 22, 2023.\n\nBoebert-a fervent Trump ally and part of a coalition of extreme-right-wing members of Congress who regularly attack Democrats-said, \"Liberal privilege is real,\" in a tweet on Friday about the case, alluding to right-wing conspiracies of collusion between Hollywood and liberal lawmakers and power players.\n\nSpecial prosecutors on Thursday dropped two counts of involuntary manslaughter charges against Baldwin, 65, in connection with the shooting death of a cinematographer on the New Mexico set of \"Rust\" in October.\n\nConservatives have used the shooting to criticize Baldwin and boost the gun-rights narrative that people who fire guns are responsible for shooting deaths, rather than firearms.\n\nBaldwin-who has said he did not pull the trigger-was rehearsing a cross-draw when the Colt .45 he was holding fired a bullet that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. In addition to Baldwin, the film's armorer responsible for guns on the set, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, was also charged with two counts of involuntary manslaughter. Assistant director David Halls, who handed Baldwin the gun, was sentenced to six months of probation on charges of negligent use of a deadly weapon last month. Prosecutors dismissed the case against Baldwin on Thursday after investigators found that the gun's trigger control was improperly functioning and the joints of the revolver were fatigued, ABC News reported .\n\nConservatives politicized the shooting and used it as an opportunity to criticize Baldwin, whose spot-on, Emmy-winning portrayal of Trump on the late-night comedy show infuriated the former president and his allies. The hashtag #AlecBaldwinforprison trended on Twitter shortly after the shooting, and Trump's son Don Jr. hawked T-shirts that read, \"Guns don't kill people, Alec Baldwin kills people.\"\n\nBaldwin fired back at Trump in 2018 after the then president suggested SNL should face \"retribution\" for what he described on Twitter as a \"total Republican hit job.\" Baldwin responded by questioning whether the Tweet \"constitutes a threat to my safety and that of my family.\"\n\nAlec Baldwin Charges Dropped Because Of Trigger Malfunction, Report Says (Forbes)\n\nAlec Baldwin Charges Dropped After Fatal 'Rust' Shooting, Lawyers Say (Forbes)\n\nAlec Baldwin Wins Emmy For 'Saturday Night Live' Donald Trump Impression (Forbes)"

Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) questions Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young during a House Committee on the Budget hearing in March. (Photo by Rod Lamkey - Pool/Getty Images)\n\nT he campaign for Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) has placed advertisements directing supporters to buy her new memoir from retailers, an arrangement that may violate campaign-finance laws.\n\nFederal law prohibits candidates from shelling out campaign funds for personal purposes , defined as expenses that \"would exist irrespective of the candidate's election campaign or individual's duties as a holder of federal office.\"\n\nOn or before May 5, Boebert's campaign began running an ad for her new book, \"My American Life,\" on WinRed, the Republican's online fundraising platform that is typically used to solicit campaign donations. While a disclaimer at the bottom says that WinRed paid for the ad, the URL includes lauren-boebert-for-congress, and the ad has an option to sign up for updates from Lauren Boebert for Congress.\n\nWinRed regularly runs ads in which candidates offer their book in exchange for a campaign donation . In those circumstances, the Federal Election Commission requires the campaign to buy the book in a manner that won't lead to a royalty for the author (which is typically done by purchasing directly from the publisher at a discount).\n\nBoebert's ad is different. It directs supporters to buy her books from retailers, like Amazon and Books-A-Million, which could theoretically lead to royalties. (Boebert's book deal has yet to appear on one of her annual financial disclosures .)\n\nA spokesperson for Boebert's campaign said the ad follows previous guidance from the FEC. Boebert's representatives cited two advisory opinions that stated a campaign's website and social-media accounts may advertise a candidate's book and direct consumers to a retailer, as long as the cost of adding that promotional material to the site and accounts would be negligible.\n\nAn expert in campaign finance, however, disagrees with that interpretation. \"Both of the advisory opinions cited by them involve book advertisements placed on the campaign's own website-not ads that were placed on someone else's website for a fee,\" said Brett Kappel, an attorney at Harmon, Curran, Spielberg & Eisenberg. \"WinRed could not provide that hosting service for free, or it would be an in-kind contribution by WinRed to the campaign.\" FEC records do not appear to show any such donations .\n\nA spokesperson for WinRed did not respond to an inquiry.\n\nIn April 2021, the FEC received a similar complaint about Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) from government watchdog Campaign Legal Center. Cruz was using campaign funds to buy ads on Facebook that encouraged supporters to buy his latest book at a retailer. The Campaign Legal Center has not received a response to its complaint.\n\nAn ad for Rep. Lauren Boebert's (R-Colo.) new books directs would-be buyers to retailers, possibly leading to royalty payments for Boebert."

After Green refused to stop, House Speaker Mike Johnson ejected him from the chamber. The House later voted to censure Green in a 224-198-2 vote, with 10 Democrats, including Houlahan, backing the censure motion.\n\nBoebert's remarks and Houlahan's motion in response demonstrate the bitterness between Republicans and Democrats in Congress following a presidential election in which both parties' candidates accused their rival of being a threat to American democracy . They may also be an attempt by Houlahan to ingratiate herself with the Democratic grassroots after she was criticized for voting to censure Green.\n\nOn Monday, Houlahan introduced House Resolution 202, calling for Boebert to be censured over \"her recent disparaging and derogatory comments about Representative Al Green of Texas.\"\n\nThe resolution noted that, referring to Green during an interview with Real America's Voice on March 7, Boebert had said \"for him to go and shake his pimp cane.\"\n\nIt described Boebert's remarks as \"disparaging, derogatory, and racist toward another colleague\" and \"a breach of proper conduct and decorum of the U.S. House of Representatives.\"\n\nHoulahan's resolution said Boebert should be censured, required to \"present herself in the well of the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of censure\" and \"censured with the public reading of this resolution by the Speaker.\"\n\nDuring Boebert's March 7 Real America's Voice News interview, the Colorado Republican said: \"Al Green was given multiple opportunities to stand down, to sit down, to behave, to show decorum.\n\n\"For him to go and shake his pimp cane at President Trump was absolutely abhorrent.\"\n\nSome grassroots Democrats criticized Houlahan after she was one of the 10 party members who backed the motion to censure Green over his conduct.\n\nHoulahan told The Philadelphia Inquirer : \"I believe we need to recognize that we have rules in the House of Representatives and we have standards of decorum that we all presumably agree to, and we all need to agree to those standards so we can get the work for the people done and so we cannot be a banana republic.\"\n\nDemocratic Pennsylvania Representative Chrissy Houlahan, in a press release: \"After my discussion on the House floor last week when Speaker Johnson told me he'd have to censure half the members if he actually enforced the rules of the Congress, I decided to help, and tonight introduced a resolution to censure Representative Boebert for her racist and derogatory statements about Representative Al Green (D-TX).\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters before the vote to censure Green: \"We take no pleasure in this. I gave repeated warnings to Rep. Green to stand down and to sit down and he refused to do it. He chose to deliberately violate House rules in a manner that we think is probably unprecedented in history, interrupting the message of a president of the United States, who is an honored guest.\"\n\nThe Republicans have a majority in the House, meaning the odds of Houlahan's motion to censure Boebert being passed are slim.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nJames Bickerton is a Newsweek U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is on covering news and politics in Texas, as well as other general news across the United States.

But maybe Houlahoo is really the racist here. Are only Blacks pimps? Is that what I'm hearing? Are there no cisgender white pimps in America?\"\n\nBoebert also said: \"Representative Houla whatever, Houlahan, Houlaha. She has decided that she was getting far too many attacks from her base for voting against the censure of Representative Al Green and decided to attack me for referencing his cane as a 'pimp cane.'\"\n\nSpeaking to Real America's Voice on Tuesday, Representative Lauren Boebert said : \"Listen, it was a little slight to his cane and his gesture-his cane that was wielded at the president of the United States-and you know what, if she wants to censure me over it, go ahead and try girlfriend. I have the American people who will show up, who will donate and who will reelect me.\"\n\nRepresentative Chrissy Houlahan said in a news release on Monday : \"After my discussion on the House floor last week when Speaker Johnson told me he'd have to censure half the members if he actually enforced the rules of the Congress, I decided to help, and tonight introduced a resolution to censure Representative Boebert for her racist and derogatory statements about Representative Al Green.\"\n\nAs the Republican Party has a slight majority in the House of Representatives, the chances of the motion to censure Boebert passing are slim.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nJames Bickerton is a Newsweek U.S. News reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is on covering news and politics in Texas, as well as other general news across the United States.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nRepresentative Lauren Boebert falsely claimed a bill for no tax on tips passed the House, and now, people are accusing her of not reading the bill she voted on.\n\nFollowing the passing of the Budget Resolution, Boebert posted on X (formerly Twitter ) that President Donald Trump had kept his election promise around no taxation on tips through this resolution.\n\nThere is no bill within this budget that ends taxation on tips. The closest the budget comes to addressing tax on tips is describing a way in which lawmakers in the future could create a bill that ends tax on tips.\n\nBoebert has been contacted via email for comment.\n\nVoters put their trust in their elected representatives to know what they are voting for, and how it will affect their constituents.\n\nBoebert is one of several Republicans and other MAGA influencers to have spread misinformation about the content of the budget resolution online. The budget passed by a razor thin margin, raising concerns over whether the representatives who passed it knew what they were voting for, or if they were getting their information on the bill from MAGA accounts on X.\n\nThe Budget Resolution, which passed the House by a 217 to 215 margin, aims to slash $2 trillion from government spending.\n\nWhile it does not contain a pathway for removing tax on tips, it does slash $880 billion from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the committee which provides funding to Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\n\nUmmm.... It literally didn't. That wasn't in https://t.co/sAVkrmFDGL 14 2025... Shouldn't you know what you are voting on?\n\nThe president and House Republicans have said Medicaid would not be touched by this budget, but that significant a cut from the House Energy and Commerce Committee can only come from its Medicaid and CHIP funding. If healthcare spending was left unaffected from the budget, they would fall $600 billion short of the Republicans' goal, per The New York Times .\n\nThe sole Republican to vote against the resolution was Kentucky Representative Thomas Massie , who said the bill did not do enough to reduce the federal deficit.\n\nThe budget focuses largely around tax relief . While proponents of the bill say that reducing taxes will free up economic growth, detractors say that the tax benefits go almost exclusively to the very rich, and that trick-down tax relief does not ultimately benefit the middle and working class.\n\nAn analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) found \"the cost of extending tax cuts for households with incomes in the top 1 percent-$1.1 trillion through 2034-equals roughly the same amount as the proposed potential cuts for health coverage under Medicaid and food assistance under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\"\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert : \"No Tax On Tips has passed the House! Promises Made. Promises Kept. That's how MAGA works!\"\n\nX user Art Candee, a Chicago-based artist and frequent Trump critic: \"That didn't take long. Lauren Boebert is such a liar. It's clear Gropert didn't even read the bill she voted for.\"\n\nThat didn't take long. Lauren Boebert is such a liar. It's clear Gropert didn't even read the bill she voted for. 🤦‍♀️ pic.twitter.com/Ki1H7IloIr\n\nRep. Summer Lee, posted to X: \"I voted NO on the Republican budget resolution that would rip $1.84 billion from Medicaid in my district alone. This 'budget' is a betrayal and a direct attack on working families, seniors, and children.\"\n\nI voted NO on the Republican budget resolution that would rip $1.84 billion from Medicaid in my district alone.

My full statement: pic.twitter.com/ngm1EEg78D\n\nAlex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek for a previous article : \"While few taxpayers will get angry with a smaller bill, these cuts come at a time when the country's growing deficit is coming under scrutiny, especially in the role it has played in recent inflationary pressures. The tax cuts are good for some Americans' wallets, but the long-term implications may not be.\"\n\nThe Budget Resolution bill will have to be combined with the Senate 's open budget proposal to create a combined resolution via a reconciliation process. Both chambers are Republican controlled, so it is likely they will reach an agreement.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nSophie Grace Clark is a Live News reporter based in London, with a focus on crime stories.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nRepresentative Lauren Boebert has successfully secured another term in Congress after a high-stakes campaign that saw the controversial Colorado congresswoman switch districts to boost her chances.\n\nBoebert won her election with 53 percent of the vote, according to a NBC News. 82 percent of the vote had been counted at the time the race was called.\n\nThe result indicates that Boebert's brand of hardline conservatism continues to resonate with her Colrado voter base. Her new district, stretching from Fort Collins to the eastern plains, is largely populated by a reliable base of conservative voters aligned with her pro-gun, pro-Trump platform.\n\nShe also enjoyed the endorsement of Donald Trump , which some political analysts said should not be underestimated.\n\nBobert almost lost her 2022 reelection bid and faced fierce opposition in her former district, with celebrities such as Star Wars actor Mark Hamill backing her opponent, Trisha Calvarese.\n\nAhead of the primary election, Boebert switched from the 3rd congressional district to the 4th, which had an open seat following Representative Ken Buck's retirement and is considered a safer Republican district.\n\nNo public polling was conducted ahead of the election for Boebert's race, but The Economist gave her almost certain odds of winning.\n\nThe outlet's prediction model based on 10,000 simulations of the election, national polling, voting history and fundraising in October found Boebert had a 23 percent margin.\n\nBoebert ran a campaign that doubled down on her signature issues: gun rights, border security, and energy independence.\n\nAs a staunch advocate for the Second Amendment, she warned voters that their gun rights were under threat from Democrats . Boebert also criticized the Biden administration's regulations on oil and gas.\n\nTrump endorsed Boebert early on, solidifying her position as a champion of the MAGA wing of the Republican Party . Trump's backing, combined with her alignment with high-profile conservative voices, helped her secure significant grassroots support and financial backing.\n\n\"President Trump's endorsement can't be underestimated,\" Democratic CBS Colorado Democratic political analyst Mike Dino said. \"That was very helpful to her early on because, you know, it was a big risk for her to leave her comfortable-or at least seemingly comfortable-3rd Congressional District and move over across the Continental Divide.\"\n\nCalvarese, Boebert's Democratic challenger, had a last-minute fundraising boost in the month before the election.\n\nShe raised an additional $560,000, according to an October 16 filing, bringing her fundraising total to $3.74 million. She and Boebert and similar amounts of cash on hand, according to the October 16 filing, but Calvarese's fundraising was still less than Boebert's, who raised $4.48 million.\n\nBuck held the seat that Boebert is taking over for nine years and won reelection in 2022 with 61 percent of the vote. A Democrat hasn't won the seat since 2008, and Boebert's election victory on Tuesday night was a stark contrast from her performance in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, she scraped home by just 546 votes in one of the closest election races in the country.\n\nBoebert said she switched districts to give her family a \"fresh start.\" In 2023 she filed for divorce from her husband, Jayson Boebert.\n\nMonths after filing, Boebert was asked to leave a performance of the musical Beetlejuice for disruptive behavior that included \"vaping, singing and causing a disturbance.\" She posted on X, formerly Twitter , that she was guilty of enjoying the show and laughing.\n\nVideo footage from the theater showed Boebert and her date, Denver bar owner Quinn Gallagher, fondling each other, something Boebert initially denied doing.\n\n\"There's no perfect blueprint for going through a public and difficult divorce, which over the past few months has made for a challenging personal time for me and my entire family. I've tried to handle it with strength and grace as best I can, but I simply fell short of my values on Sunday,\" Boebert said at that time.\n\nBoebert is expected to continue her vocal opposition to the Biden administration and to push her agenda focused on limiting government regulation, protecting gun rights, and advocating for energy independence.\n\nHer election bolsters her position as a key player in the House Freedom Caucus and a leading voice for the populist right in the Republican Party.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nJenni Fink is a senior editor at Newsweek, based in New York.

Her new eastern district is the most Republican in the state, with a 2023 Cook Partisan Voting Index rating it R+13, compared to the 3rd District's R+7 rating.\n\nBoebert is a staunch supporter of Donald Trump , the Republican presidential nominee, and has been endorsed by the former president, who in March called her a \"trusted America First fighter.\"\n\nThe Economist 's latest prediction model of the race between Boebert and Democratic challenger Trisha Calvarese shows Boebert winning in a landslide. The model, which includes updated polling data, voting history in the district, candidate fundraising and national polling, ran 10,001 simulations of the election. As of Wednesday, the model found Boebert with a +23 percent vote margin, \"a better than 19 in 20 chance\" of securing the seat.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the Boebert and Calvarese campaigns for comment via email on Wednesday.\n\nHouse races typically have fewer polls, especially in less competitive districts. However, polling aggregates from FiveThirtyEight and The Hill also show strong, unwavering support for Boebert in the upcoming election. There haven't been any reported polls since Boebert won the primary in June.\n\nAlthough prediction models favor Boebert, Calvarese has made significant ground fundraising, bringing in about $3.18 million since the start of the race, including $2.6 million this quarter, according to Colorado Public Radio.\n\nOpenSecrets shows Calvarese with more cash on hand than Boebert. The former had more than $1.3 million, compared with Boebert's $548,551, as of September 30.\n\nOn Friday, Boebert spoke at Trump's rally in Aurora , which is in the state's 6th District.\n\nBoebert asked rally attendees if they are ready for Trump to return to the White House in January 2025 and \"look the swamp creatures in the eyes and say, 'As I was saying...'\" In 2020, Boebert joined 146 other representatives in voting to overturn the election results. President Joe Biden won the 2020 election, and there is no evidence of widespread voter fraud as Trump and his allies have claimed.\n\nIn December 2020, Boebert posted on social media: \"Objecting to the counting of certain electoral votes is NOT 'overthrowing' the results of the election if those votes were won through fraud.\"\n\nUpdate 10/17/24, 12:40 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with new figures for the Calvarese and Boebert campaigns' fundraising.\n\nMandy Taheri is a Newsweek reporter based in Brooklyn.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nRepresentative Lauren Boebert , a Colorado Republican , threatened on Friday to \"look in a different direction for leadership\" if Colorado Republican Party Chairman Dave Williams does not demonstrate clear support for GOP candidates across the ballot.\n\nWilliams has recently faced calls for removal from his position following contentions within the state's GOP as the party abandoned its tradition of neutrality in the June 25 primaries.\n\nThe Colorado GOP endorsed candidates in competitive primary elections, drawing disputes from many in the party. Of the 18 candidates endorsed by the party, only four won their contests.\n\nIn addition, Williams, who has faced calls for his resignation since January, lost the 5th Congressional District primary despite endorsements from former President Donald Trump and Boebert. His loss and subsequent actions, including controversial remarks about Pride Month, have intensified demands for his ousting, with more than a dozen county Republican parties passing resolutions in June demanding Williams be removed.\n\nIn a social media post on Friday, Boebert expressed her concerns, describing the infighting within the state GOP as \"embarrassing to watch.\" She also accused Williams of failing to provide the necessary support and coordination since last month's primary, calling it a \"failure to lead.\"\n\n\"The past month of public dissension and infighting in the Colorado Republican Party has been embarrassing to watch as we have a golden opportunity this November to flip seats at every level of government,\" the congresswoman wrote on Facebook . \"This isn't about competing policies or ideologies; this is about a failure from Chairman Williams to lead after our Primary Election and simply reach out to candidates and organizations throughout Colorado and beyond to offer support, mend bridges, and present a clear gameplan of how we can win together in November.\"\n\nShe continued: \"An attempted, and likely contested, change in leadership at COGOP just 100 days out from Election Day will be disruptive and damaging, but Chairman Williams has put himself in this situation. I stand ready to publicly help and provide support to Republicans up and down the ballot, regardless of whether or not I agree with them on every issue. If Chairman Williams can't do the same and refuses to show candidates he will, Republicans in Colorado and nationally will look in a different direction for leadership over the final 100 days.\"\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Boebert and Williams via email for comment.\n\nThe state GOP is set to convene on Saturday at a church in Brighton, 101 days before ballots are due on November 5, to decide whether to remove Williams and other party officials, including Vice Chairwoman Hope Scheppelman and Secretary Anna Ferguson. If removed, new officers will be elected to serve until next spring.\n\nHowever, Williams has continued to reject calls to step down as party chairman.\n\nAccording to Colorado Politics, who spoke to the Colorado GOP via text message, the state GOP responded to Boebert's criticism by insisting that Williams and the party have already expressed full support for their nominees.\n\n\"We are not sure where Lauren Boebert is getting her erroneous information but Chairman Williams and the State Party have already expressed full support of the Party apparatus to our nominees and we are well on our way to providing resources to help get them across the finish line,\" the party said in a statement to Colorado Politics.\n\nIn addition, the Colorado GOP said in a statement on Thursday to state central committee members that Saturday's meeting won't count, telling Republicans that the meeting was \"invalid, illegal, and should be ignored as any business conducted will be illegitimate\" as Williams attempted to block the meeting from being considered official party business by suing.\n\n\"SCC Members are advised to ignore his fraudulent call as any actions taken at his fake meeting will be invalid,\" the state party said. \"Your current leadership team will remain in place regardless of what happened at the unlawful and fake meeting this weekend.\"\n\nHowever, an Arapahoe County District Court judge recently rejected the motion to prevent the gathering.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNatalie Venegas is a Weekend Reporter at Newsweek based in New York.

He joined Newsweek in February 2018 after spending several years working at the International Business Times U.K., where he predominantly reported on crime, politics and current affairs.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nRepresentative Lauren Boebert of Colorado has introduced a bill that would abolish the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).\n\nNewsweek has contacted Boebert's office and the ATF for comment via email outside of regular working hours.\n\nThe federal agency that regulates firearms has long been a target of Republica ns. MAGA lawmakers, including Boebert, may feel emboldened to now go after such targets as the GOP enters 2025 controlling both the House and Senate , with President-elect Donald Trump also set to return to the White House on January 20.\n\nBoebert introduced HR 129 on January 3, when Congress reconvened for its 119th term.\n\nThe bill remains in the early stages of the legislative process, and no text is currently available.\n\nRepublicans have accused the Joe Biden administration of having \"weaponized\" the ATF against gun owners in the U.S. The ATF regulates the firearm and explosive industry and also, with local enforcement, traces weapons that have been used in crimes.\n\nMissouri Representative Eric Burlison called for the ATF to be abolished in November 2024 during an appearance on Fox News Digital. Burlison cited numerous \"mistakes\" attributed to the agency, including Operation Fast and Furious.\n\nThe failed sting operation, which ran from 2009 to 2011, was intended to allow firearms to be illegally sold in the U.S. to purchasers believed to be linked to Mexican drug cartels and track them. However, hundreds of the nearly 2,000 firearms involved were lost by the agency, and some were later linked to murders, including the killing of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in December 2010.\n\nThe ATF has also been accused of regulatory overreach by gun rights groups, namely when introducing a rule that classified pistols equipped with stabilizing braces as short-barreled rifles. The National Firearms Act (NFA) imposes stricter requirements on short-barreled rifles because they are more concealable than long-barreled rifles while having greater firepower than handguns.\n\nIn August 2024, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the stabilizing brace rule was likely illegal.\n\nBoebert is one of Congress' staunchest gun rights advocates . She previously owned Shooters Grill, a restaurant in Colorado where staff can openly carry firearms.\n\nColorado Representative Lauren Boebert speaking on the House floor in February 2023: \"There's been a lot of talk about defunding the ATF, even abolishing the agency altogether, and I'm still here waiting to hear a good reason why the ATF should remain an agency at all. Instead of providing regulations that keep our communities safe, this agency has made our communities more dangerous by wandering weapons to the cartels. Operation Fast and Furious exposed the recklessness of the ATF, how little regard they have for the rule of law, and Americans have had a hard time viewing these agencies and their rules as legitimate.\"\n\nTexas Representative Pat Fallon, a Republican, during an Economic Growth, Energy Policy, and Regulatory Affairs subcommittee hearing in May 2023, said: \"Under the Biden administration, the ATF has been weaponized against gun owners and Americans who wish to acquire firearms in numerous ways in recent years.\"\n\nMissouri Representative Eric Burlison, speaking to Fox News Digital in November 2024: \"The ATF is a disaster. For decades, they've been a disaster agency, and they've been violating the Second Amendment. Every time they try to get involved, they mess things up. They have a long history of mistakes...This is an agency that just continues to violate citizens' rights and Second Amendment rights, and I think that at the end of the day, this agency needs to be abolished.\"\n\nSteven Dettelbach, ATF director, told The New York Times , in December : \"People who don't think that law enforcement, including ATF, has anything to do with driving down violent crime are just wrong-it didn't happen by accident...What I am concerned about is that is that people will take their eye off the ball, that they'll either get complacent or political, or some combination of those things...That will result in more people getting killed.\"\n\nBoebert's bill has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee for consideration.\n\nDespite the GOP's trifecta government, the bill to abolish the ATF has a 4 percent chance of advancing past the committee and a 2 percent chance of being enacted, according to Govtrack.us, which tracks congressional votes. In 2021-2023, 11 percent of bills made it past committee and about 2 percent were enacted, according to the website.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nEwan Palmer is a Newsweek News Reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on US politics, and Florida news.

      "text": "Empty Threats to Sue Donors of Entity That Allegedly Defamed You Could Be Tortious\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nFree Speech\n\nEugene Volokh | 8.12.2024 10:27 AM\n\nAmerican Muckrakers PAC, Inc. v. Boebert (D. Colo. June 9, 2024) (just recently posted on Westlaw) stemmed from the PAC and journalist David Wheeler making various allegations about Rep. Lauren Boebert. Rep. Boebert said they were all lies, threatened to sue Wheeler (which she did), and also \"threatened donors to Plaintiff American Muckrakers PAC, Inc., in a ... statement to the media,\" saying \"Muckrakers' sloppy, reckless, and wildly irresponsible actions have created substantial legal liability for Muckrakers, David Wheeler in his personal capacity, and each donor to the organization who chose to fund the effort knowing it would result in defamation.\"\n\nThe PAC and Wheeler sued for various torts, including defamation (based on Boebert's claims that plaintiffs had been lying) and interference with contract and prospective advantage. Magistrate Judge Kathryn Starnella recommended that the defamation claims be dismissed under the Colorado anti-SLAPP statutes, on the grounds that plaintiffs hadn't introduced enough evidence that Boebert knew that her allegations of Wheeler's lying were false or likely false (\"actual malice\"); for more on that, see the opinion itself.\n\nBut the Magistrate Judge recommended that the tortious interference claim based on the threats of litigation against the donors be allowed to go forward, reasoning:\n\nThe ... third, fourth, and fifth factors [of the interference tort, as set forth by the Restatement (Second) of Torts,] \"require[ ] a balancing of the parties' conflicting interests to determine whether the interference was warranted under the particular circumstances[.]\" Here, both Plaintiffs (and their donors/sponsors) and Defendant were engaged in First Amendment activity, so their interests are neutral. The social interests weigh in favor of Plaintiffs' contractual interests because Plaintiffs rely on donations to perform their work reporting on matters of public interest (and their donors/sponsors express themselves through monetary contributions), while Defendant enjoys a large platform by virtue of her elected office.\n\nWhile Defendant has an interest in protecting her reputation, even through litigation, Plaintiffs' donors and sponsors have a weightier interest in exercising their First Amendment right to engage in political speech (in the form of financial donations to political action committees) without fear of retaliation. The Court finds no social value in allowing elected officials to silence speech they dislike by threatening gadfly journalists' donors, who have not themselves engaged in any unlawful or tortious activity.\n\nTurning to the Restatement's sixth factor, the close temporal proximity between Defendants' comments and the diminished donations, including from donors who cited the threat of litigation, demonstrates the proximity of Defendant's conduct to the interference.\n\nFinally, while the parties have no contractual or commercially competitive relationship, the Court finds that the Restatement's seventh factor (the relations between the parties) weighs toward a finding of impropriety because Defendant is an elected official with a large platform and access to multiple media platforms, while Plaintiffs' speech concerning matters of public interest and Defendant, a public official, relies upon donors' and sponsors' support.\n\nOverall, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of proving that Defendant's threats of litigation against donors/sponsors (as opposed to her allegedly defamatory comments about Plaintiffs and her threats of litigation against Plaintiffs) were improper. In making this finding, the Court emphasizes that the \"determination that [Plaintiffs have] demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success is in no way an opinion that [they] will actually prevail.\"\n\nAfter the report was handed down, the parties settled and the case was dismissed.\n\nAs the Restatement notes,\n\nThe use of [threats of litigation] is ordinarily wrongful [and thus potentially tortious] if the actor has no belief in the merit of the litigation or if, though having some belief in its merit, he nevertheless institutes or threatens to institute the litigation in bad faith, intending only to harass the third parties and not to bring his claim to definitive adjudication.\n\nTo be sure, lawsuits against major donors who donate a lot of money to entities that they know will use the money to engage in defamation might be viable. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 876(b) (\"For harm resulting to a third person from the tortious conduct of another, one is subject to liability if he ... knows that the other's conduct constitutes a breach of duty and gives substantial assistance or encouragement to the other so to conduct himself\"). But the tort requires substantial assistance; to quote the comments to § 876(b),\n\nThe assistance of or participation by the defendant may be so slight that he is not liable for the act of the other. In determining this, the nature of the act encouraged, the amount of assistance given by the defendant, his presence or absence at the time of the tort, his relation to the other and his state of mind are all considered.\n\nGiven that the PAC had raised hundreds of thousands of dollars, and the largest donation (according to FEC disclosure forms) seemed to be under $3000, the threat of lawsuits against donors did appear likely to be empty.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Colorado Hasn't Even Approved Ranked Choice Voting Yet, and Already Lawmakers Are Trying To Delay It\n\nVoting\n\nJoe Lancaster | 6.3.2024 2:55 PM\n\nWhen Coloradans head to the polls in November, they'll be voting on more than just which uninspiring geriatric to send back to the White House. They may also get to pick an entirely different way to vote, by adopting ranked choice voting. But state lawmakers want to delay the effort before the vote can even happen.\n\nRanked choice voting (RCV) is not a new concept, but it has gained traction in the past few years. On a traditional ballot, voters pick one candidate per office, and whoever gets the most votes is the winner-in most states , even if they don't win an outright majority.\n\nBut on an RCV ballot, voters can rank each candidate in order of preference. If one candidate gets over 50 percent of the votes, then that candidate wins. But if no candidate gets an outright majority, then the lowest performer is eliminated, and all ballots that picked him first are retallied with their second choices counted. This continues until a majoritarian winner is declared.\n\nRCV is now used statewide in Alaska, Hawaii, and Maine, plus localities in fourteen other states have also approved its use-including Colorado towns like Boulder and Fort Collins.\n\nColorado Initiative 310 would authorize the process statewide. Starting in 2026, in an effort to \"have more choice to elect candidates who better reflect the will of a majority of the voters,\" the proposal would replace party primaries for state and federal offices with a \"primary election featuring all candidates for those state and federal offices, with the final four candidates advancing to the general elections,\" where voters could rank the four in their preferred order.\n\nRanked choice voting is not without detractors: \"I will oppose this effort to rig our electoral system in Colorado with everything I have,\" tweeted Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) after the measure was announced. \" Ranked choice voting is a scheme launched by well-moneyed interests who are only concerned with their own power and not giving Coloradans a choice at the ballot box. \"\n\nFormer Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin blamed her state's switch to RCV for her defeat in her 2022 race for U.S. Congress. While 17 states allow RCV in some or all elections, nine states have outlawed it since 2022.\n\nNow, lawmakers in Denver are apparently trying to forestall the measure before voters can even weigh in.\n\n\"Last-minute provisions added to a broad bipartisan election bill would create a major barrier to efforts to overhaul Colorado's election process,\" Jesse Paul reported last week at The Colorado Sun. A brief amendment added to Senate Bill 210 , which passed both chambers of the state Legislature, \"would require a dozen Colorado municipalities in counties of a certain size and with a specific demographic makeup to conduct ranked choice elections,\" wrote Paul.\n\nThe amendment was added by state Rep. Emily Sirota (D-Denver), who called the amendment \"a totally fair way to ensure if the voters pass a ballot measure that it is rolled out in a methodical way.\" The amendment featured contributions from the Colorado County Clerks Association, whose executive director, Matt Crane, told The Colorado Sun that \"anytime that you are going to make a seismic change to an election model, it's a bad idea to do it without understanding all the impacts of it.\"\n\nNot everybody is convinced: A consortium of voting rights organizations, including the League of Women Voters of Colorado and FairVote, which supports the adoption of ranked choice voting, signed a letter to Gov. Jared Polis, urging him to kill the bill.\n\n\"[Sirota's] amendment applies a convoluted, and perhaps unmeetable, set of terms and conditions which would indefinitely delay, and likely prevent, implementation,\" the letter reads. \"Creating a phony pretext that gives partisan elected officials the authority to effectively stop implementation of a law approved by voters is very simply wrong.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "States Will Choose Whether To Adopt or Abandon Ranked Choice Voting\n\nVoting\n\nJoe Lancaster | 9.26.2024 3:05 PM\n\nFor those of us who actually vote , the process can be dispiriting. It often involves waiting in long lines on a weekday at some random schoolhouse or decommissioned train depot, just to cast a ballot for a candidate that chances are, you don't even particularly like-you just hate the other guy more .\n\nRanked choice voting could potentially help break up these doldrums. On a ranked choice ballot, instead of picking one candidate from a list, voters rank each candidate in order of preference. If one candidate wins an outright majority, then that person wins; if not, then the lowest-performing candidate is eliminated, and their ballots are re-tallied and allotted to whomever they picked as their second choice. This process repeats until one candidate passes 50 percent.\n\nWhile ranked choice can't cure what's wrong with American politics, it can at least prevent the election of candidates without majoritarian support. It could also help potentially break up the two-party logjam by allowing people to vote for alternative candidates without worrying about acting as a spoiler-after all, if their desired candidate doesn't win, their vote will be re-tallied for whomever they would likely have settled for anyway.\n\nThe November elections represent an inflection point in the widespread adoption of ranked choice voting: Four states and Washington, D.C., will vote on whether to adopt such a system of their own. And of the two states that currently use ranked choice voting statewide, one will decide whether to abandon it.\n\nSome cities in the Centennial State already use ranked choice voting, most prominently Boulder . Proposition 131 would implement ranked choice statewide for U.S. senator and representative, state senator and representative, governor, lieutenant governor, and certain other state offices.\n\nCurrently , Colorado has partially closed primaries, open only to party members and unaffiliated voters-members of one party cannot participate in another party's primary. Proposition 131 would replace party primaries with \"an all-candidate primary election featuring all candidates for those state and federal offices, with the final four candidates advancing to the general elections.\" On the general election ballot, \"the voter may rank candidates in order of preference\" and \"may choose to rank as many or as few candidates for the covered offices...as the voter wishes, including ranking just one candidate per covered office.\" The votes would then be tallied and re-tallied as needed until one candidate achieved a majority.\n\nThe measure has attracted both supporters and detractors from each major political party. \"Colorado has changed in the last 10 years,\" said former Colorado Republican Party Chair Dick Wadhams. \"We went from a third...in the electorate to now, nearly 50% of the electorate are unaffiliated voters. They are rejecting both parties, and they're rejecting both parties because both parties are going to their extremes, both Republicans and Democrats.\"\n\nGov. Jared Polis (D) also endorsed the measure, writing on Facebook, \"I think instant runoff voting is better than our current system because it gives voters more choices. I'm hopeful that if it passes it will encourage participation and improve our democracy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) called ranked choice voting a \"scheme\" in a 2023 post on X and pledged, \"I will oppose this effort to rig our electoral system in Colorado with everything I have.\" The Colorado Democratic Party voted this month to oppose the initiative. The Green Party of Colorado also opposes the measure, with party Co-Chair Patrick Dillon saying he supports ranked choice voting but opposes the measure's dissolution of closed primaries.\n\nIf passed, the measure would take effect on January 1, 2026, but a recent state law imposed preliminary requirements on the rollout of a ranked choice system that will likely delay implementation until at least 2028. Nonetheless, the measure is expected to pass , with a recent poll finding nearly 65 percent of likely voters planning or likely to vote \"Yes.\"\n\nMuch like in Colorado, Proposition 1 would \"abolish Idaho's party primaries\" and replace them with \"a top-four primary and voters may vote on all candidates.\" The four with the highest vote counts will advance to the general election, which would use a ranked choice ballot.\n\n\"For the past 12 years, Idaho has had closed primary elections,\" notes an explainer video from Idahoans for Open Primaries. \"Closed primaries block 270,000 independent voters from voting in the most important elections, and that's just not right. Elections are taxpayer funded, and when we're paying for it, we shouldn't be forced to pick a side to participate.\"\n\nRepublicans in the deep-red state are split on the issue. \"Every registered voter should have the right to weigh in on choosing our leaders,\" former Gov. Butch Otter (R) said last year when endorsing the measure. \"Independents, including a lot of military veterans, have been excluded from having their say because of the closed GOP primary.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Idaho Republican Party Chairwoman Dorothy Moon called ranked choice voting \"a pernicious plot to take away your ability to vote for conservative lawmakers.\"\n\n\"The blanket primary takes away your right to nominate your own candidates,\" she added. \"Just as [Brigham Young University] doesn't get to decide who starts at quarterback for [Boise State University], neither should Democrats get to vote on who represents the Republican Party in the general election.\"\n\nNevada Question 3 would amend the state constitution to \"allow all Nevada voters the right to participate in open primary elections to choose candidates for the general election,\" at which point they would rank the top five candidates for each office. The covered races include most state offices, plus U.S. senator and representative.\n\nNevada currently uses closed primaries in which only party members can vote in primaries. \"Voters registered to a minor party or not affiliated with a party may only vote for nonpartisan contests during a primary election,\" per the Nevada secretary of state . The state constitution also allows that \"a plurality of votes given at an election by the people\" shall constitute a victory, even without capturing a majority. Question 3 would eliminate party primaries, and the ranked choice ballot would force candidates to achieve a majority to win an election.\n\nNevada's proposal differs from most others on this list in that it institutes a top-five ballot instead of a top-four. It also has one of the fastest turnaround times: If adopted, the measure would go into effect by July 1, 2025, in time for the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nAnother way in which it differs from other states is that in Nevada, it's largely Democrats who oppose the initiative. \"Enshrining this system in Nevada's state constitution would be a mistake because meaningful access to the ballot box is too critical to our system of representative government to sacrifice at the alter [ sic ] of an unproven and unwieldy experiment,\" state Assemblyman Steve Yeager (D-Las Vegas) told The Nevada Independent . Former Gov. Steve Sisolak and Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen-all Democrats-oppose the measure as well.\n\nIn 2023, the Oregon Legislature passed a bill putting a ranked choice proposal on this year's ballot. If passed, Measure 117 would go into effect on January 1, 2028, after which both primary and general elections for state and federal office-including governor, U.S. senator or representative, and president-would be decided by a ranked choice vote. It would also require the secretary of state to \"establish [a] program to educate voters about how ranked choice voting will be conducted.\"\n\nCurrently , both Benton and Multnomah Counties use ranked choice voting, as does the city of Portland. If enacted, Measure 117 would authorize all cities and counties, plus other local jurisdictions like school districts, to use it as well. The measure is supported by groups like the American Civil Liberties Union of Oregon and multiple state chapters of the League of Women Voters.\n\nOn the other hand, some Oregon Republicans oppose the measure: \"Ranked Choice voting introduces complexity into the process of determining a winner,\" state Rep. E. Werner Reschke (R-Klamath Falls) said in a 2023 memo . \"After the 2016 and 2020 presidential election, one of the last things our election system needs is more skepticism by Oregonians.\"\n\nIt's ironic that Oregon Republicans would so forthrightly oppose the switch: According to the Cook Political Report , the state tilted 6 points more Democratic than the nation as a whole in 2022. But that same year, Gov. Tina Kotek (D) won office with only 47 percent of the vote; Christina Drazan, the Republican candidate, captured 43.6 percent and trailed Kotek by fewer than 67,000 votes. Independent candidate Betsy Johnson, meanwhile, got over 168,000 votes; on a ranked choice ballot, if enough of Johnson's voters had picked Drazan as their second choice, the state might have a Republican governor.\n\nInitiative 83 would implement ranked choice voting in the nation's capital \"to allow voters to rank up to five candidates according to their preference in each contest for any office.\" While it would not get rid of party primaries, it would \"permit any voter who is not registered with a political party to vote in the primary election of that voter's choosing for all offices.\"\n\nThe district is governed by a mayor and a 13-member city council; councilmembers are elected from each of the city's eight wards, while the other five are elected \"at large.\" While the city overwhelmingly votes Democrat, federal law stipulates that the at-large members cannot all belong to the same political party. But as Colbert I. King wrote in The Washington Post , \"Recent history is replete with examples of known Democrats who changed their party affiliation, registering as independents to run for those congressional set-asides.\"\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, then, D.C. Democrats largely oppose Initiative 83. Mayor Muriel Bowser, for example, called ranked choice a \"bad idea\" and \"not necessary.\" Charles Wilson, chair of the D.C. Democratic Party, told The Washington Post that allowing unaffiliated voters to participate in Democratic primaries would \"dilute\" the party's voice.\n\nThe Yukon State is the outlier on this list: Alaska voters adopted ranked choice voting in 2020 and used it in the 2022 election cycle. But Ballot Measure 2 will let Alaskans vote on whether to scrap it altogether and bring back \"a Political Party Primary and General Election Process that is easily understood.\"\n\nFormer Gov. Sarah Palin ran as a Republican in a 2022 special election to fill the state's sole congressional seat. Palin won the most votes in the primary but came up short in the general election: When none of the three candidates (a fourth competitor dropped out after the primary) cleared the hurdle of 50 percent, the votes were re-tallied. And even though Palin and another Republican, Nick Begich III, collectively captured 60 percent in the first round, only half of Begich's voters picked Palin as their second choice, while 30 percent picked Democratic candidate Mary Peltola. (The remaining 21 percent of Begich's voters picked no other candidates.) When the second round of votes were tallied, Peltola emerged victorious with 52 percent of the vote. Palin ran again in November to win the seat for a full two-year term, and again lost to Peltola when the ballots were re-counted.\n\nSince then, Palin and other Republicans have blamed ranked choice voting for her loss. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) called it \"a scam to rig elections\" and complained that even though \"60% of Alaska voters voted for a Republican...a Democrat 'won.'\" Palin had previously said ranked choice was so \"bizarre\" and \"convoluted\" that \"it results in voter suppression.\"\n\nBut a January 2023 report from the R Street Institute found that in 2022, 90 percent of Alaskan incumbents won reelection, only slightly below that year's national average of 94 percent. And 85 percent of Alaskans polled said they found the system \"somewhat simple\" or \"very simple.\"\n\n\"Alaska has been a success story for open primaries and ranked choice voting, and Ballot Measure 2 would be a major step backwards for Alaska voters,\" says Will Mantell, director of communications at FairVote, an organization that advocates for ranked choice voting. In 2022, \"Alaska voters expressed their independent streak by electing a conservative Republican governor, a moderate Republican senator, and a moderate Democratic congresswoman.\"\n\nRanked choice, currently only used statewide by two states, could be adopted by as many as four more this year. \"Any one of the four states considering\" ranked choice voting \"would become the most populous state to use it,\" says Mantell.\n\nInterestingly, the measures are both supported and opposed in different states by different political parties and coalitions. And while there are a number of reasons for anyone to support or oppose a piece of legislation, it's especially notable that ranked choice voting is largely opposed by the majority parties: Democrats in Nevada and Washington, D.C., and Republicans in Idaho and Alaska, largely oppose ranked choice voting.\n\nIt's entirely possible that their opposition is genuine, but it certainly appears that firmly ensconced politicians simply don't want anything that would threaten their hold on power.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Journal of Free Speech Law: \"Empowering Speech by Moderating It,\" by Danielle Keats Citron & Jonathan Penney\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nFree Speech\n\nEugene Volokh | 10.11.2024 4:56 PM\n\nThe article is here ; the Introduction:\n\nA myth of epic proportion has gained traction: that any effort to moderate online speech is a zero-sum game, with free expression as the loser. When social media companies remove destructive posts that violate terms of service, people cry, \"Censorship!\" Alex Jones, founder of the far-right conspiracy news site Infowars, accused YouTube of \"killing the First Amendment\" after the company blocked videos that revealed maps of the homes of Sandy Hook families. This isn't just an extremist view: the Pew Research Center has found that a majority of people believe that companies are engaged in \"political censorship\" when they moderate content. Some legislators have made this view a cornerstone of their political philosophy. At a House Oversight and Accountability Committee hearing in February 2023, Representative Lauren Boebert denounced Twitter as a \"speech overlord.\" To the company's former head of Trust and Safety, Yoel Roth, she angrily admonished, \"How dare you\" shadow-ban my posts (even though no evidence supported the claim and former Twitter executives denied it). Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene stated that Big Tech was silencing Americans. The censorship narrative has gained traction in state legislatures as well. Underlying this view is the assumption that content moderation has no upside for free expression.\n\nThe outcry is similarly strident at the suggestion that law should curtail online abuse. Online assaults that include doxing, intimate privacy violations, and threats are dismissed as weak attempts to \"blow off steam.\" Any effort to address them is viewed as a threat to free speech. The ACLU, for instance, has adamantly opposed the passage of laws penalizing the nonconsensual disclosure of intimate images. These laws risk chilling legitimate expression, the ACLU has argued, even though the laws made clear that they would not cover matters of legitimate public interest. Under law's blighting stare, free expression is impossible.\n\nFor more than a decade, we have been interrogating these claims. Rather than vanquishing free expression, combating online abuse frees people to speak. In the face of online assaults that amount to cyberstalking or intimate privacy violations, targeted individuals stop expressing themselves. They close their social media accounts, lest perpetrators exploit those accounts to attack them. They withdraw from family and friends. If their loved ones try to \"talk back\" to abusers, they face terrifying online assaults themselves. Victims and their loved ones are silenced and terrorized. Research makes clear that online abuse exacts significant costs to free expression.\n\nAs our research suggests, legal and industry interventions against such abuse make space for more expression rather than less. Such interventions enable victims to speak their truths. Rather than silencing speech that deserves normative protection, law and corporate policies enable victims to trust companies enabling communications so they can reveal themselves and share their truths.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

The letter has been signed anonymously by over 200 staff from House and Senate offices.\n\nFrom the CNN story:\n\nIn a rare move, more than 200 congressional staffers have sent a letter to Democratic leadership in the House and Senate, demanding they close the deal on a climate and clean energy package and warning that failure could doom younger generations.\n\n\"We've crafted the legislation necessary to avert climate catastrophe. It's time for you to pass it,\" the staffers wrote in a letter, sent to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday evening. The letter, which staffers signed anonymously with initials, was shared first with CNN.\n\n\"Our country is nearing the end of a two-year window that represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to pass transformative climate policy,\" the letter continues. \"The silence on expansive climate justice policy on Capitol Hill this year has been deafening. We write to distance ourselves from your dangerous inaction.\"\n\nAs CNN reports, letters from congressional staff telling members of Congress what to do are uncommon. From the CNN story:\n\nAnonymous letters from congressional staffers criticizing leadership are rare -- especially ones that push for specific legislation -- but staff have spoken out in letters before.\n\nIn summer 2020, Black staffers penned a letter to leadership urging action in the wake of George Floyd's killing by a Minneapolis police officer. Over 400 staff members also signed a letter in December 2021 urging House leadership to condemn \"incendiary rhetoric\" in the workplace after Republican Rep.

      "text": "Stop Blaming the Attempted Assassination on Heated Anti-Trump Rhetoric\n\nMedia Criticism\n\nRobby Soave | 7.15.2024 3:15 PM\n\nA consensus is swiftly forming among Republican politicians, activists, and media figures that the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump can be blamed on the heated, occasionally violent anti-Trump rhetoric deployed by President Joe Biden, leading Democrats, and mainstream media pundits.\n\nThis is a deeply cynical and misguided tactic-and Republicans are well aware of it, since they have rightly criticized their political opponents for doing the exact same thing.\n\n\"Today is not just some isolated incident,\" wrote Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), Trump's pick  for vice president , on X (formerly Twitter). \"The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination.\"\n\nConservative author Ben Shapiro said that likening Trump to Adolf Hitler-an action taken by \"nearly everyone on the Left, up to and including the current president\"-had increased the likelihood of political violence. Reps. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) blamed anti-Trump rhetoric for the shooting.\n\n\"To the media,\" said Greene . \"This is your fault.\"\n\nConservatives also specifically faulted Biden for recently promising to \"put Trump in a bullseye.\" Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-La.) flagged this comment in a recent interview with Anderson Cooper, insisting that such rhetoric has consequences. (Cooper pointed out that Trump had just recently used heated rhetoric, calling Biden a threat \"to the survival and existence of our country.\" Johnson replied that \"everybody is prone to overstatement.\")\n\nAsserting that Biden's bullseye comment had anything to do with political violence is obviously ridiculous. Moreover, Republicans know that it is ridiculous. In fact, they rightly criticized The New York Times and other media outlets for embracing the preposterous idea that former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin was morally responsible for the attempted assassination of Gabby Giffords. The accusation against her was remarkably similar: The media seized on a map , circulated by her political action committee, that placed target crosshairs over Giffords' district. There is no evidence whatsoever that Giffords' shooter ever saw the map or that he was influenced by Republican rhetoric or even motivated by conservative ideas at all.\n\nIt is absolutely fair to call out the double standard. It's true mainstream media wholly embraced the idea that Republicans are to blame for political violence because of things like the crosshairs on the map but said nothing critical about Biden's bullseye comment. But Republicans like Vance aren't calling out that double standard-they are participating in it. They are doing the same thing from the other side: blaming political violence on Democratic rhetoric.\n\nIt's true that both parties, their activists, and their acolytes in the media could all benefit the country if they turned down the overheated rhetoric. Routine accusations that such-and-such political leader is a fascist, or Hitler, or a communist, or a dictator are not making things better for anyone. But words do not have some hypnotic power to induce others to commit violence. As always, when a deranged person takes up a gun and attacks someone, we should blame that individual-not other people's words.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Beyond Mercy and Grace\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert tends to make everything about the least important issue in America-herself.\n\nDear Rep. Boebert,\n\nYou and I have a couple of things in common-not much, but something. First: I too have been thrown out of a theater, and it was in all the papers, though in my case it was good for my (nonexistent) political career , while your shenanigans seem to be hurting yours. Second: I was, for a time, a resident of the House district you represent-not in ritzy Aspen, but in the relatively hardscrabble town of Craig, known as the elk-hunting capital of the world where the main businesses (in my time there) were coal and a gas-pipeline project.\n\nWhile the very real possibility that you will lose your House seat-either to a primary challenger or in the general as Colorado trends Democratic-sinks in, you have been speaking hopefully of \" a lot of mercy and a lot of grace ,\" as though being deprived of these were your problem.\n\nThat isn't your problem.\n\nBut while we are on that subject, you might ask yourself: If the tables were turned, and a political rival had behaved in the way you have behaved, how much mercy and grace would you be extending toward that person? If it were a Democrat, you'd be vicious. And if it were a Republican, you'd be even worse. You are due for some penance and contrition, and half-assed self-aggrandizing nonsense (\" I was a little too eccentric ... I'm on the edge of a lot of things \") isn't going to do it. Your opening crisis-control strategy-lying about what had happened-did not help much. But you lie about a lot of things, and everybody knows that about you. God's mercy may be a free gift, but if you want to earn back the good graces of the people you represent , you're going to have to do some work.\n\nIt probably would be better for everybody, including you, if you went and did something else in life and let someone more capable represent the people of your district.\n\nLet's focus on the word represent for a second. Ultimately, you are in Congress on behalf of others, but you have a tendency to make everything about the least important issue in America- you . The people you represent may decide, at some point, that they wish to be represented instead of being used as a platform for whatever daft pseudo-celebrity ambitions you have for yourself.\n\nProbably the House of Representatives is not the best place for you. The temptations of the office are too great for a weak character such as yours. You haven't conducted yourself like a legislator; you have conducted yourself like a performance artist. But if you are going to stay in the House, or try, then you probably ought to think about starting to do your job. Because if you are going to lose your seat, it isn't because the easygoing people of your district have branded you with a scarlet letter. It is because you are a terrible representative in both senses of the word: bad at the job of being in the House and bad at personally carrying forward the interests and the values of the people on whose behalf you serve, or on whose behalf you are supposed to be serving.\n\nOne of your problems-and I don't think you quite understand this-is that you aren't on a legislative career path. You are on a reality television career path, a kind of Real Housewives with real consequences.\n\nThe fall from grace and ritual humiliation is a pretty common (damn near universal) part of the reality television story arc, and that is where you are right now. No doubt you are looking forward to the triumphal celebrity comeback and giving that big speech in which you consider with false humility \"everything I've been through\" (any halfway decent writer could have the script down cold a year or more in advance), but not every entertainment figure gets that story arc. Sometimes, you're Robert Downey Jr. , sometimes, you're DMX . But in spite of their disparate outcomes, those two had something important in common: real talent. You don't have that-do you feel very much like Iron Man? You have a kind of low talent for self-promotion, and that has carried you to where you find yourself.\n\nI am all for grace and mercy for people who go through terrible things, including rich and powerful people who go through terrible self-inflicted things in public. As I once wrote about troubled basketball star Allen Iverson, if you had given me his money and his fame at the age he got them, I'd have turned out a lot worse than he did (and I had a lot of advantages in life that he didn't). I do not enjoy seeing people humiliated, even when they have it coming. (And we all have it coming.)\n\nAnd while I believe-as I assume all right-thinking people believe-that you are an absolute cancer on American politics, one who somehow manages to be beneath the standards of the God-forsaken Republican Party, I do not especially want to see you humiliated. One way to reduce that humiliation-one you should probably think about-would be returning to private life.\n\nThat decision might get made for you.\n\nBecause for all your talk about \"mercy\" and \"grace,\" the question facing the people of your district isn't really a moral one. In the greater scheme of things, it doesn't matter very much that you behave like ... whatever it is you are. The question for the people of your district is a prudential one: Does having Lauren Boebert as our representative serve our interests?\n\nI can't imagine that many of them-aside from your fellow QAnon cultists and nuts of that kind-really believe that it does. I don't know your district all that well, but I can think of a half a dozen people who live there who would do a better job for Colorado's 3rd Congressional District than you do. I am sure that there are people who live there who can think of 50. William F. Buckley Jr. once joked that he'd prefer to be governed by the first 2,000 names in the Boston phone book than by the 2,000 faculty of Harvard; I don't know how big the Grand Junction phone book is, but I am confident it contains someone who can do your job with more skill and dedication-and less shame and drama-than you. You talk about this as though it were personal, but it isn't personal: It's business. And you are bad for pretty much every business except TMZ.\n\nI am all for mercy and grace, but that has nothing to do with whether you belong in the House of Representatives. This isn't about you, Rep. Boebert. And your problem is that you still haven't figured that out.\n\nKevin D. Williamson is national correspondent at The Dispatch and is based in Virginia.

Even the carpetbagger's 29-point win held a silver lining for normalcy nostalgists.\n\nCandidates endorsed by Donald Trump were rejected in Republican primaries across the map, some by ignominious margins. The man whom he hoped would replace his nemesis, Mitt Romney, in the Senate is headed for a 20-point defeat in Utah. His hand-picked choice for the House district that encompasses Colorado Springs fell short by more than 30 .\n\nHe almost got a win in South Carolina's 3rd District, where Trump-backed pastor Mark Burns lost a 51-49 squeaker . But Burns \"had called for teachers who push an LGBTQ+ agenda in schools to 'be immediately terminated,' lied about obtaining a bachelor's degree, misrepresented his military service and urged protesters in Washington ahead of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol,\" per Politico .\n\nNo wonder he was so competitive in a Republican primary.\n\nAs for Boebert, she may have cruised to victory in her new district but she did so with 43.4 percent of the vote. The rest of the electorate split evenly among five challengers, four of whom ended up in double digits. Even in a race in which lowbrow populism prevailed, in other words, nearly 60 percent of Republicans preferred another option.\n\nThe best news on a night of good news came from New York, however. And it came from the other party.\n\nIt's tragically rare for a fringy populist who's made it to Congress to be ousted in a primary. Gerrymandering has made it hard and the gradual civic degradation of the American people has made it harder. It does happen occasionally-ask Steve King or Madison Cawthorn-but it takes a lot to get primary voters motivated to dump A Man of the People after he's gained the advantage of incumbency.\n\nKing spent nearly 20 years in the House before his confusion about why white supremacy should be thought of as a bad thing finally did him in. Cawthorn was a conspicuously young one-termer buried in scandal who made enemies of the Republican leadership when he chattered in an interview about the cocaine and orgies some of his House colleagues allegedly enjoyed.\n\nWe live in an era without shame. And so you need to be very, very embarrassing -more embarrassing than this , even-to be too embarrassing for shameless American voters to return you to Congress.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman is very, very embarrassing .\n\nBowman is affiliated with the Squad, the nickname given to the vanguard of young, nonwhite progressive populists in the House. The Squad fills a similar niche politically on the left that Tea Party Republicans filled on the right circa 2011. They're hard ideologues, they purport to represent the voiceless grassroots of their party, and they're keen to repopulate the ranks of their House caucus with insurgents who share their beliefs.\n\nThey're darlings of the activist class and so they frequently embarrass themselves, as activists are wont to do. Usually that embarrassment takes anodyne policy forms, such as enthusiasm for unworkable economic nonsense like the Green New Deal. But from time to time it reveals itself in other, darker ways .\n\nJamaal Bowman is embarrassing even by Squad standards.\n\nFour years ago he scored one of the biggest progressive primary victories of the populist era when he ousted establishment mainstay Eliot Engel. Four years later, on Tuesday night, he became the first member of the Squad to lose a primary-and not by the skin of his teeth. He'll end up falling short of centrist challenger George Latimer by 16.8 points or so when all the votes are counted in New York's 16th District.\n\nDo you have any idea how embarrassing you need to be to get blown out in a primary by a normie in 2024 despite having impeccable populist credentials?\n\nBowman is the guy who pulled a fire alarm in the Capitol last October, seemingly out of desperation to thwart a House vote on a spending bill. That earned him a censure from his colleagues and a misdemeanor charge. In January it came out that he had published 9/11 conspiracy theories on his blog years ago ... in the form of free-verse poetry : \"2001/Planes used as missiles/Target: The Twin Towers.... Later in the day/Building 7/Also Collaspsed [ sic ]/Hmm.../Multiple explosions/Heard before/And during the collapse/Hmm...\"\n\nHe was a middle school principal at the time. Imagine trusting your child's education to someone who sounds like Tucker Carlson on a good day .\n\nBowman's most embarrassing behavior, and by far the most salient to his primary race, involved his commentary on Israel since October 7. National Review summarized the lowlights:\n\nHe has revealed himself to be a staunch friend of Hamas and an opponent of the Israeli state's right to exist. Little more than a month after October 7, Bowman appeared with Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib to call for a \"cease-fire now,\" informing his Jewish constituents who might object that \"by me calling for a cease-fire with my colleagues and centering humanity, I am uplifting deeply what it actually means to be Jewish.\" During one pro-Hamas rally, Bowman denied that the terrorist group raped Israeli women, claiming the well-documented atrocities were a \"lie\" and \"propaganda\"-a statement which he ham-handedly apologized for only recently. In an interview with Politico , he lamented that in his district, \"There's certain places where the Jews live and concentrate\"-ignoring their need to be near synagogues, Kosher supermarkets, and other institutions essential to practicing Judaism.\n\nHe had to issue a second apology after sitting for an interview with Norman Finkelstein , who compared the slaughter by Hamas on October 7 to the Jewish uprising in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II. Later Bowman took to describing Israel as a \" settler colonial project ,\" progressive jargon designed to delegitimize the nation as a usurpation of Palestinian rights to the land. His hostility to the Jewish state grew so queasy that the advocacy group J Street, which promotes left-of-center solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, withheld its endorsement from him this year.\n\nBy the end of the campaign with Latimer, Bowman and his supporters had identified one villain above all others who was determined to see him driven from power:\n\nThe people are rising up against AIPAC and their republican billionaires 💪🏿\n\nWe won't let them buy our communities in NY-16 or anywhere!\n\nJoin me @AOC and @BernieSanders as we prove that the many will ALWAYS  beat the money! https://t.co/xWyzGmzwII pic.twitter.com/qHhsozss5v\n\n- Rep.

(@JamaalBowmanNY) June 23, 2024\n\nThat's not the first time a Squad member has accused the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), the nation's best-known Jewish-aligned lobbyist group, of \"buying\" political support. On Saturday, at a rally attended by progressive royalty like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bowman went a step further and vowed to \" show f-ing AIPAC the motherf-ing power of the South Bronx \" in the primary.\n\nThat was an embarrassing line when it was uttered and even more embarrassing in hindsight given Tuesday's results. But in fairness to him, AIPAC did not succeed in ending Jamaal Bowman's political career.\n\nIt only seems that way because both sides of the left's Israel divide have reason to pretend that it did.\n\nThe grain of truth in the \"AIPAC sank Bowman\" narrative is that the group did spend a mind-boggling amount of money on his race.\n\nAs of June 20, over little more than a month, AIPAC dropped $14.5 million to promote Latimer. That accounted for more than half of the $24 million total spent on the race to that point, making it the most expensive primary in U.S. history . Post hoc ergo propter hoc : If the spending was extraordinary and a populist incumbent losing is extraordinary, it must be that AIPAC's spending caused Bowman's defeat.\n\nIt makes sense. But it's almost certainly not true.\n\nFor starters, Latimer's gaudy margin didn't develop recently, as one might expect if AIPAC's lavish expenditures in May and June had propelled him to victory. One poll taken all the way back in late March, before AIPAC's cash began flowing, gave him a 52-35 lead over Bowman. Another survey conducted in early June found him ahead by the same margin, 48-31. In the end, on Tuesday night, Latimer prevailed by an almost identical margin of 16.8 points.\n\nIn three months, the race never moved. There's a stronger case that AIPAC wasted its money on a contest the challenger had in the bag all along than that Bowman would have been reelected without its involvement.\n\nThe hype about AIPAC might also lead you to believe that the group successfully turned the election into a referendum on Israel. The people's champion, Bowman, strained mightily to make the race about the sort of kitchen-table issues the working class cares about, progressives might tell you. But the dastardly Jewish lobby plowed millions into an effort to distract Democratic voters with a shiny foreign-policy object.\n\nThe truth is basically the opposite.\n\n\"Few of the ads that the group paid for in New York mentioned Israel,\" the New York Times said of AIPAC in its postmortem of the campaign. Instead those ads emphasized Latimer's support for infrastructure spending, a sore spot in the district given that Bowman voted no on the infrastructure bill that passed Congress in 2021. \"His district is not woke. It is Democratic,\" one former Bowman adviser told The Atlantic . AIPAC appeared to understand that and focused its political energies accordingly. The congressman, who spent the end of the campaign shrieking about the influence of \" the Zionist regime we call AIPAC ,\" weirdly did not.\n\nHe's simply not a good retail politician. He disdains the entire concept of retail politics, in fact, sneering in an interview with HuffPost in May that Latimer \"doesn't do anything. He's a retail politician. He has coffee with Dem leaders to make them feel good about themselves.\" One local official complained to the Times that \"I could see Latimer maybe five times a week.... I've only seen Bowman maybe three or four times since he's been a congressmember.\"\n\nAll you need to know about Bowman's retail skills is that the South Bronx, where he held his rally last weekend and whose \"motherf-ing power\" he vowed to show AIPAC on election night, isn't even in his district .\n\nOn top of all that, he was cursed with an unusually strong primary challenger in Latimer. Normally incumbents can count on a fearsome advantage in name recognition, but Latimer has been the top executive in Westchester County since 2018. Before that he spent 25 years representing the area in state and local government. \"A local leader who first took office in the Reagan era, he had racked up friendships, favors and familiarity through decades of retail politics at the local, state and county levels, overseeing a huge county budget and showing up at senior bingo hours,\" the Times wrote of him.\n\nLatimer was a very comfortable alternative to a congressman who'd made his constituents uncomfortable repeatedly since taking office in 2021. So why did AIPAC feel obliged to spend a cargo-hold of money on him that he didn't need? And why are progressives intent on convincing observers that that was the difference in the race?\n\nThe answer is that the two wings of the left's split over Israel benefit from the false narrative that the group is responsible for Bowman's defeat.\n\nFor AIPAC and its supporters, the logic is simple: Pour encourager les autres .\n\nMany progressives in Congress share Bowman's opinions on Israel, of course. AIPAC is eager to raise the political cost to them of doing so. Blowing $14.5 million on a race their preferred candidate was all but certain to win anyway is their way of warning Democratic Hamas apologists to now witness the firepower of this fully armed and operational political battle station . The bigger the number, the more firepower anti-Israel Dems have to fear.\n\nThe acronym \"FAFO,\" which I'll leave you to Google for yourself, leaps to mind.\n\nThat message was sent so clearly and emphatically that even some pro-Israel House Democrats were left grumbling to Axios on Wednesday about how heavy-handed it was. \"The number is gross.... I don't like it,\" one Democrat said of AIPAC's spending against Bowman. \"If anything, that much money could backfire, because then you get people that are like, 'This is just wrong.'\"\n\nThe irony is that AIPAC almost certainly chose to get involved in the race only because Bowman was already en route to a humiliating defeat. When the group had a chance to spend against progressive Rep. Summer Lee in her own primary in Pennsylvania earlier this year, it declined in the belief that she'd win anyway and AIPAC would be left looking impotent . Jumping into Bowman's contest to bounce the rubble is tantamount to racing out in front of a pro-Latimer parade that's already in progress and purporting to lead it.\n\nStill, $14.5 million really is a big number. And the group isn't done this summer with targeting progressives: It's already begun spending to defeat Missouri Rep. Cori Bush, another Squad-ster who spent the first weeks of the war accusing Israel of \" ethnic cleansing .\" A poll released on Tuesday found her primary challenger, Wesley Bell, surging 14 points since January to take a 1-point lead. AIPAC knocking off Bush on top of Bowman's defeat really might spook some House Democrats into biting their tongues the next time they're moved to defend Hamas.\n\nProgressives have their own reasons to push the \"AIPAC sank Bowman\" lie, meanwhile.\n\nFor starters, it fits easily into the standard populist political template of brave truth-tellers facing down a corrupt yet all-but-invincible establishment. (Populists love a martyr, as this newsletter frequently has occasion to note.) Whom would you choose if you had to cast the role of \"villainous establishmentarian\" in a left-wing fable about the New York primary? The average joes who voted in Westchester County? Unassuming Democrat George Latimer? Or AIPAC, the beating heart of Zionist influence in American politics bent on providing political cover for Israel's \"genocide\"?\n\nTreating AIPAC money as the root of Bowman's defeat also conveniently lets progressives go on pretending that their vitriolic contempt for Israel and uncritical solidarity with the Palestinians is popular, mainstream, and certainly not an electoral liability. In a fair political fight Americans would side with them and Hamas, you see; only because the Israel lobby continues to pour oceans of cash into shaping public opinion does the U.S. continue to support the Jewish state.\n\nBowman himself promoted that storyline in stark terms after Tuesday's defeat.\n\n👀 This line is Bowman's concession speech on AIPAC ⬇️\n\n\"We should be outraged when a super PAC of dark money can spend 20 million dollars can brainwash people into believing something that isn't true.\" pic.twitter.com/hfLhytDtwV\n\n- Jacob N. Kornbluh (@jacobkornbluh) June 26, 2024\n\nThe goal here, very obviously, is to delegitimize the idea that Democratic voters might prefer a pro-Israel candidate for rational reasons by implying that something untoward and illicit happened in Bowman's race. Latimer supporters weren't persuaded, they were \"brainwashed.\" Voters in the district didn't reject the incumbent because they found his antics repulsive, they did it because a rich special interest corrupted democracy with unprecedented spending.\n\nProgressives want hostility to Israel to become left-wing, and ultimately Democratic, orthodoxy. (They're well on their way .) Convincing liberals that Zionists played dirty pool somehow in Jamaal Bowman's race suits those purposes. Cori Bush is already in on it , in fact, no doubt hoping that left-wing outrage at his defeat will spur turnout in her own upcoming primary.\n\nAnd so, in the end, everyone has a cynical and self-interested reason to pretend that AIPAC was the difference on Tuesday ... except, strangely, Jamaal Bowman himself.\n\nHe does have a reason, to be sure-blaming the group conveniently absolves him of being a terrible politician-but I agree with Jonathan Chait's theory of why the congressman became so obsessed with AIPAC as his primary wore on. It's not that he was resigned to defeat and looking to maximize his appeal to hard-left activist groups after he leaves Congress, as some have suggested. It's that he got sucked so deeply into left-wing argle-bargle about Zionism and \"settler-colonialism\" that he either forgot he had an election to win or convinced himself that that argle-bargle would actually win him the election.\n\n\"Bowman has simply gotten so carried away with the logic of progressive-movement politics that he's lost all sight of the practical opportunities to build an electoral coalition rooted in the liberal side of the intra-Jewish debate,\" Chait surmised. He could have aligned himself with J Street as a harsh critic of Benjamin Netanyahu's government while still endorsing a two-state solution and Israel's right of self-defense, but he kissed off mainstream liberals who hold those positions when he sank into denialism about October 7 and demagoguery about Zionist influence. As Chait put it, \"Liberal Jews who disagree with AIPAC are going to suspect that somebody who treats AIPAC as the greatest force for evil in the world is harboring deeper levels of hostility toward their community.\" Thus was Latimer's win assured.\n\nBowman blamed the Jews-sincerely-and lost his election because of it.

      "text": "Yes, the House Voted on Articles of Impeachment for President Biden. But Not in a Way That Really Matters.\n\nThe resolution that passed merely forwarded a resolution by Lauren Boebert to committee for review.\n\nThe House of Representatives may not be back in session until next week, but that hasn't stopped the spread of a viral Facebook video that makes it appear lawmakers recently voted on articles of impeachment for President Joe Biden.\n\nThe video, which features the teasing subtitle \"What Happens Next is Unbelievable,\" is actually quite believable, as the vote it depicts occurred more than two months ago. Passing on June 22 with a count of 219-208 (and seven abstentions), the resolution featured in the video clip- H. Res. 529 -referred GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert's separate resolution, H. Res. 503 , to the House Committee on Homeland Security and Committee on the Judiciary. Boebert's resolution, which would impeach President Biden for high crimes and misdemeanors relating to abuse of power and dereliction of duty in the handling of immigration and the southern border, is now under committee review and consideration.\n\nWhile the House did technically vote on Boebert's articles of impeachment, the vote was solely on whether to refer them to the relevant committees for further review-not on whether to approve or deny them. The list of U.S. presidents to be impeached by the House, at least for now, remains at only Andrew Johnson , Bill Clinton , and Donald Trump .\n\nHouse Republicans will likely take up the issue of President Biden's potential impeachment again next week when they return to session, and Boebert's resolution may very well end up receiving an up-or-down vote in the future. For now, however, Biden remains decidedly unimpeached.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "Is It True That Texas Has Reported No COVID Deaths Since Lifting Pandemic Restrictions?\n\nNo.\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert claimed in an interview last Wednesday that there had been no coronavirus deaths in Texas since the state lifted its pandemic restrictions in March. \"Republicans are just following the science, and since removing the mask mandate two months ago, Texas has not reported a single COVID death. Not one,\" Boebert told Gina Loudon during an interview on Real America's Voice, a right-wing news outlet.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott ended the state's mask mandate and allowed for businesses to return to full capacity on March 2. As reported in a previous fact check , this did not mean the state immediately went maskless-many businesses, including some of the largest retail and grocery chains in the state, retained a mask requirement, and cities continued to maintain a mask requirement on public property. Texas' seven-day average for new reported coronavirus cases and hospitalization rate continued to decline following Abbott's executive order, as vaccination numbers continued to increase.\n\nBoebert is incorrect, however, to state that no coronavirus deaths have been reported since then. Daily coronavirus deaths have gone down since March 2, but there were a further 3,650 deaths in Texas between March 2 and May 24 according to data from the Texas COVID-19 Dashboard.\n\nBoebert's communications director Ben Stout told The Dispatch Fact Check that \"Our communications team provided talkers, based off Fox News and Newsweek articles, that stated 'Since ending the mask mandate 2 months ago, Texas did not report a single COVID death' when, as I'm sure you know, the talker should have been, 'Since ending the mask mandate 2 months ago, today, Texas did not report a single COVID death' referring to May 16th.\"\n\nUpdate, May 26: After we published this fact check, Rep.

      "text": "Colorado Democrats Bolster 'Stop-the-Steal' Primary Candidate\n\nPlus: Who will GOP primary voters choose to replace Mitt Romney?\n\nHappy Monday! High temperatures in Washington have been relentless, and even Honest Abe is feeling the heat .\n\nDemocrats are once again spending big money on ads to boost a \"Stop the Steal\" Republican primary candidate over a more electable Republican, this time in Colorado.\n\nLocal attorney Jeff Hurd is the leading Republican to represent Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, topping six GOP primary candidates with 27 percent in the only public poll of the race ahead of the June 25 primary. His closest rival is former state Rep. Ron Hanks, who has just 9 percent. But a left-wing political group and the presumptive Democratic nominee have together spent around half a million dollars on ads to bolster Hanks-an extremist who still maintains Joe Biden lost the 2020 election and who had raised less than $18,000 as of a filing earlier this month.\n\nRocky Mountain Values PAC has spent about $400,000 on TV, mail, and radio ads raising Hanks' profile, with one calling him \"too conservative for Colorado.\" Additionally, the campaign of former Aspen City Councilman Adam Frisch-who is running unopposed in the Democratic primary-has spent at least $100,000 to air an ad that says Hurd is \"hiding\" and won't give his position on certain issues, such as his level of support for former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe national Democratic party views the seat as a key pick-up opportunity, particularly after Frisch lost his 2022 race against the district's current congresswoman, Rep. Lauren Boebert, by just over 500 votes. Now that Boebert has decided to run for an open seat in the 4th District to improve her electoral chances, Democrats look to be using part of the more than $14 million Frisch has raised so far to influence Republican voters.\n\nDemocratic meddling in GOP primaries to boost fringe candidates to run against in the general is nothing new. During the 2022 midterms, Democrats boosted primary challengers to Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after the January 6 riot-such as John Gibbs, who successfully primaried Rep. Peter Meijer before losing in the general election, and Chris Mathys , who unsuccessfully challenged Rep. David Valadao. Statewide primary candidates such as Pennsylvania's Doug Mastriano and Ron Hanks himself also received support.\n\nOutside of a couple of instances , the party has avoided this strategy this cycle after Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Rep. Suzan DelBene denounced the tactic in January.\n\nBack in 2022, Hanks made the \"Stop the Steal\" movement a centerpiece of his Senate run. (His 2022 campaign began with a video of him blowing up an office copier labeled \"Dominion Voting Machine.\") Two years later, his House run sounds remarkably similar. \"Joe Biden is a fraudulently installed agent of a foreign power, period,\" he told Dispatch Politics in an interview. \"He's been a garbage human being since he first entered politics, and he's been a disgrace to his family name. I can't wait to see the man gone. He's one of the most hateful, spiteful human beings. He did not outperform President Trump in 2020.\"\n\nHanks added that the \"foreign power\" consisted of \"globalists and China,\" as well as \"whoever's controlling this world government,\" with \"Barack Hussein Obama\" likely being an \"intermediary.\" Days before his primary he attended what he described to Dispatch Politics in a text message as \"an event for the families of the Jan6 political prisoners\" at a Trump property in New Jersey.\n\n\"This is about American Freedom. I will travel the world to protect it and to spread the word,\" he told Dispatch Politics when asked why he was not in his district days before the primary.\n\nHurd, who identifies as a \"constitutional conservative,\" is the former chair of the chamber of commerce in the district's second-largest city, Grand Junction. In an interview with Dispatch Politics , Hurd demurred when asked if he supported Trump in his previous two runs for the White House and if he plans to do so this fall.\n\n\"I usually don't talk about who I voted for or who I'm planning to vote for, other than to say I'm a conservative Republican-and have been consistently-and voted Republican. But I think what happens is, with that question, people are trying to ask, 'What tribe are you in?' And I guess I resist that sort of pull, and I say, 'Look, I'm on the side of the 3rd Congressional District.'\"\n\nHe added that Democratic opposition to his campaign shows he's the stronger candidate to beat Frisch.\n\n\"I think the goal is from the Democratic playbook, which is to pull the weaker candidate in the primary across the finish line so that they can be easily defeated in the general,\" Hurd said. \"And I think the fact that these groups are coming after me, that Adam Frisch, the Democrat, is coming after me, goes to show that I'm the guy they're afraid of. I'm the only candidate who's running a serious and effective campaign.\"\n\nConservative groups have also spent money to counter Hanks' run. The Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF), a super PAC aligned with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, has taken a similar line to Hurd's in spending about $410,000 , with one ad painting Hanks as a \"liberal\" who \"abandoned President Trump.\" \"Locked, loaded, liberal. Ron Hanks: a bullseye for liberals, a misfire for Colorado,\" the ad's voiceover says.\n\n\"The Democrats' ads against me were at least factual that, hey, I'm conservative, I stand with Donald Trump,\" Hanks said about the CLF ad. \"This trash from the deep-state Republicans and the establishment Republicans are just flat lies. And the fact that I was ever a liberal is simply untrue.\"\n\nRocky Mountain Values PAC also took issue with the content of the CLF ad. Last week the liberal group sent a cease-and-desist letter, which Dispatch Politics obtained, to local stations that aired the ad, calling the claim that Hanks abandoned Trump \"an apparent attempt to mislead Colorado voters into thinking that Mr. Hanks is not an extremist MAGA politician.\"\n\nCLF, for its part, claimed the letters proved Democrats want Hanks to win the nomination.\n\n\"Democrats are so desperate to nominate Ron Hanks, they're actually sending cease and desist letters on his behalf now,\" CLF Communications Director Courtney Parella told Dispatch Politics .\n\nRocky Mountain Values PAC and the Frisch campaign did not respond to Dispatch Politics ' requests for comment. But a spokeswoman for the super PAC told The Hill voters should \"know the truth about who the two leading Republican candidates are for this open congressional seat.\" A representative from the Frisch campaign made similar remarks, saying of Hurd and Hanks, \"I'm tired of watching Adam take shots from both of them. As far as I'm concerned, the general election has started.\"\n\nThe race to succeed Sen. Mitt Romney will become clearer after Utah Republican voters choose their nominee in this Tuesday's primary.\n\nFour-term congressman and relative moderate Rep. John Curtis leads the pack. His top rival is Trent Staggs, the mayor of Riverton (a suburb of Salt Lake City) who has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump and who won the state party's support in a nonbinding convention earlier this year. Curtis is well-funded and has spent more than $3.5 million on his campaign, four times more than Staggs.\n\nAccording to an early June poll commissioned by the Deseret News and the University of Utah's Hinckley Institute of Politics, 34 percent of registered Utah Republicans support Curtis while 16 percent back Staggs. Two other candidates on the ballot-former state House Speaker Brad Wilson and businessman Jason Walton-polled at 12 percent and 4 percent, respectively. Thirty-three percent of voters said they were undecided, though when asked to choose a preferred candidate, they boosted Curtis to 47 percent and Staggs to 21 percent.\n\nThe winner of the primary is expected to handily defeat Caroline Gleich, a professional ski mountaineer and the only declared Democratic candidate for Senate.\n\nThe candidates are vying for an open Senate seat after Romney announced in September he would not seek a second term. The 77-year-old Romney cited his age as motivation to leave office, but the 2012 Republican presidential nominee also has been a frequent critic of Trump and was the only GOP senator to vote to convict him in both of the former president's impeachment trials.\n\nTuesday's primary will test whether candidates in Romney's mold still appeal to Republican voters in the Beehive State. While Romney's team has said he will not back a successor, other members of Utah's congressional delegation-including fellow Utah Rep. Blake Moore and former Rep. Chris Stewart -have endorsed Curtis. On Capitol Hill, Curtis is a member of both the moderate Main Street Partnership and the conservative Republican Study Committee. Like Romney, he supported codifying same-sex marriage into federal law and promoted action to address climate change as founder and chair of the Conservative Climate Caucus. But, unlike Romney, Curtis opposed both Trump impeachments.\n\nWhile Utah has been less receptive to Trump than other red states, the former president's endorsement of Staggs in April elevated him almost overnight. The Riverton mayor entered the race in May 2023 as a pro-Trump challenger to Romney before the incumbent announced his retirement. On the day Trump endorsed him in a Truth Social post , Staggs won over 69 percent of delegates at the Utah GOP convention, gaining him the party's endorsement and a place on the primary ballot. (Curtis placed a distant second place at the convention but had already gathered enough signatures to make it onto the primary election ballot.)\n\nYet Staggs' landslide victory at the convention did not make him the automatic favorite for the primary. Jason Perry, director of the Hinckley Institute, told Dispatch Politics that he does not expect the convention result to affect Tuesday's election significantly. \"In Utah historically, a more conservative candidate wins at convention and a more moderate Republican wins the primary,\" said Perry.\n\nPerry also highlighted Utah's cool reaction to Trump's political rise in the past decade. \"Utah is a center-right state,\" he said. \"A Trump endorsement holds less weight here.\"\n\nNonetheless, Curtis and Staggs have both portrayed themselves as strong conservatives focused on inflation, immigration, and standing against federal interference on Utah's vast public lands. However, Staggs has targeted Curtis throughout the race, aggressively painting him as an establishment anti-Trump \"Mitt Romney 2.0.\"\n\nAt a June 10th televised debate, Staggs accused Curtis of insider trading, pointing to Curtis' purchase of Abbott Laboratories stock the same day the Food and Drug Administration approved a coronavirus test developed by the company. Curtis denied improper behavior, calling Staggs' charge \"a low shot.\"\n\nBoth campaigns say they are confident ahead of the primary Tuesday. \"Campaigns are a math game,\" Corey Norman, a Curtis aide, told Dispatch Politics . \"I have not seen a poll that has [Curtis] below 35 percent. If he gets 35 percent, someone else will have to get about 54 percent of the remaining vote\"-an unlikely scenario in a field of four candidates, Norman says.\n\nIn an interview with Dispatch Politics , Staggs said he is hopeful his message will resonate with undecided voters by Tuesday. \"Curtis has a high name ID. Voters are not undecided because they don't know who he is. They are looking for an alternate candidate.\" Staggs said. \"We're very confident, we know [this race] is going to be close.\"\n\nPerry, of the Hinckley Institute, is less optimistic about Staggs' chances. \"John Curtis is in a very comfortable place right now,\" he told Dispatch Politics . \"There are Utahans that are still undecided, but they tend to lean towards Curtis.\"\n\n\"We're gonna show f-ing AIPAC the motherf-ing power of the South Bronx.\"\n\n-Rep.

Jared Huffman, and others in his party sent a letter to congressional leadership raising concerns ahead of Tuesday's State of the Union address and referencing past flaps. In one incident Rep. Andy Harris, a Maryland Republican, set off metal detectors by carrying a concealed gun when trying to go to the House floor.\n\nDebates about members of Congress carrying weapons are nothing new.\n\nWhat does the law allow?\n\nThe People's House used to look more like the Wild West. In the 18th and 19th centuries politicians in both chambers often were armed . Threats of violence and instances of intimidation toward other lawmakers, reporters, and witnesses, were common, according to Joanne B. Freeman, who wrote a book about violence in the Capitol in the lead-up to the Civil War.\n\nRules around firearms on the Hill have evolved since: Congress passed a law in 1967 prohibiting weapons on U.S. Capitol grounds and its buildings.\n\nThe District of Columbia in general has strict gun laws: Among other limitations , D.C. requires all permitted firearms to be registered and makes certain kinds of semi-automatic firearms illegal. The District does not recognize gun permits from other states.\n\nBut members of Congress have a carve-out : They can keep firearms in their office but must transport them unloaded and secured .(D.C. law requires transported firearms to be in a locked container and separate from any ammunition.) The limited exception does not include the right to bear a loaded firearm outside a legislator's office.\n\nGuns are explicitly forbidden on the House and Senate chamber floors and some other areas, including lobbies near both chambers and cloakrooms. Yet members of Congress disagree on exactly how to interpret these regulations.\n\nLast year, then-House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer noted in a letter to Sergeant-at-Arms William Walker that some members \"believe they have a right to carry personal firearms in these spaces, including committee rooms\" while attending hearings on crafting policies.\n\nThe gun debate .\n\nThat gray area is what prompted Huffman to push for an amendment to ban \"carrying or having readily accessible any firearm, dangerous weapon, explosive, or incendiary device\" in hearing rooms and conference rooms.\n\n\"Members have different interpretations of what those rules are,\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive Democrat, said during last week's Natural Resources hearing. \"I need to know for a sense of my own personal safety what your interpretation of the House rules are as it pertains to this issue,\" she added, addressing Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman, an Arkansas Republican.\n\nWesterman said that was a question for the House Administration Committee.\n\n\"To be clear, members and their staff are already prohibited by law from carrying guns into the hearing rooms and conference rooms of this Capitol. Currently, under statute and Capitol Police Board regulation, members are supposed to have firearms only in their offices,\" Huffman, a Democrat from California, said according to NBCNews. \"This does not allow for carrying firearms into hearing rooms and doesn't allow for walking around the Capitol with a loaded weapon. But we know some members think these rules do not apply to them.\"\n\n\"Do you think we're going to hurt you?\" Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a freshman Republican and Air Force veteran, asked Democrats. \"I would use my firearm to defend you. Just to be clear.\"\n\nWesterman noted that no other committee had a provision explicitly banning firearms from its committee room. When the committee convened in 2021 via Zoom due to COVID-19 concerns, Rep. Lauren Boebert, then a freshman Republican who made Second Amendment issues central to her brand, chose as her background a shelf displaying guns.\n\n\"With threats against members of Congress at all-time high, now is not the time to be stripping members of our constitutional right to defend ourselves,\" she said at last week's hearing. She's made ads boasting she would \"carry my Glock to Congress.\"\n\nIn 2022, the U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) force investigated 7,501 \"concerning statements and direct threats\" against lawmakers. In 2021, the figures were even higher: 9,625. In 2017, the number of cases were around 4,000. In 2021, the USCP opened field offices in Florida and California, which have dealt with the most threats against lawmakers of both parties.\n\nViolence more a concern after January 6, 2021 .\n\nIn the wake of January 6, the Democratic majority stiffened rules when former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi implemented magnetometers at the entrances of the House chamber in 2021.\n\nA week later, USCP officers had to bar Boebert from entering the House floor after she refused to allow them to inspect a bag she had with her that had set off the metal detectors.\n\nLater, Boebert, who has a concealed carry permit, seemed to suggest on Twitter that she had a firearm with her: \"I am legally permitted to carry my firearm in Washington, D.C. and within the Capitol complex.\" She also called the metal detectors a \"political stunt\" by Pelosi.\n\nIn the weeks after the Capitol riot, a fence remained around the grounds of the Capitol for months. It gradually came down, but the metal detectors remained for the entirety of Democratic control of the House. One of the first actions the Republican majority took was to remove the magnetometers, hailing the step as a sign that Congress would be more open.\n\nThe non-scalable made a return for the State of the Union.\n\nHarvest Prude is a former reporter at The Dispatch.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "House GOP Moves to Messaging Bills and Investigations\n\nPlus, a new select committee on strategic competition with China.\n\nGood afternoon. The House has a speaker and a set of rules-ordinarily a formality at the start of each Congress, but for this closely divided chamber, a bit of a saga . Now, Republicans are moving to items they largely agree on: messaging bills and investigations.\n\nRepublicans itching for reprisals in the wake of last year's FBI search of former President Donald Trump's Florida property may soon have a dedicated select committee for the task.\n\nMembers will vote today on forming a select committee with a broad mandate to investigate the federal government and empowered to dig into ongoing criminal investigations. This was a key demand among House Freedom Caucus members who initially opposed House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's bid for the gavel.\n\nThe subcommittee will be organized underneath the House Judiciary Committee, which is set to be chaired by Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan. Its purpose has been likened to the Church Committee named after Sen. Frank Church, which investigated intelligence community activities in the 1970s. It's not yet clear who the new panel's Republican members will be, nor which Democrats will participate.\n\nThe resolution forming the \"Select Committee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government\" calls on the panel to investigate the executive branch's powers to collect information on citizens, federal cooperation with the private sector \"to facilitate action against American citizens,\" and \"any other issues related to the violation of the civil liberties of citizens of the United States.\"\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith, overseeing the criminal investigation into Trump's handling of classified information after his presidency, is likely to receive much of the panel's attention. Critics have also raised concerns about whether the select committee will use its power to probe ongoing investigations involving current members of Congress such as Rep. Scott Perry . Either way, it's clear many of the highest-profile fights of this Congress may play out in this panel.\n\nThe House is also set to vote today to establish a select committee on strategic competition with China, an endeavor far more likely to be bipartisan.\n\nLawmakers broadly agree on the threats posed by an increasingly aggressive Chinese government, and Wisconsin Rep. Mike Gallagher, who is expected to chair the panel, emphasized in his recent interview with The Dispatch that he wants ideas and participation from Democrats.\n\nOne of Gallagher's early priorities: a hearing on how America reached today's urgent competition with China.\n\n\"Why did the bipartisan bet that both parties made on China fail?\" he asked. \"What were the assumptions underlying it that were wrong? What did we misunderstand about the Chinese Communist Party that we need to understand in order to have a successful policy going forward?\"\n\nRead more of his plans for the committee here .\n\nIt may take several weeks for existing committees and the new ones to get off the ground: Republican leaders delayed some organizing decisions until after the speakership race instead of addressing the question of chairmanships beforehand as is typical practice. Because of that, and as staff take the time to prepare, first hearings for some panels may not come until late February or March.\n\nRepublicans will advance legislation related to abortion this week, following through on GOP campaign trail priorities. These are unlikely to win enough support in the Democratic-held Senate to become law.\n\nOne resolution would condemn attacks on anti-abortion facilities since the Supreme Court's move over the summer to send abortion policy decisions back to the states. It also includes language recognizing \"the sanctity of life and the important role pro-life facilities, groups, and churches play in supporting pregnant women, infants, and families.\"\n\nThe resolution further calls on the Biden administration to use all appropriate law enforcement authorities to uphold public safety and protect the rights of the facilities in question.\n\nAnother bill scheduled for upcoming consideration makes permanent a ban on using federal funding for abortions. It also blocks health care facilities owned or operated by the federal government-and physicians and others employed by the government-from providing abortions. The same bill has passed the House repeatedly in recent years but has not overcome opposition from Democrats in the Senate.\n\nA third bill , the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, designates any infants born alive after attempted abortions as legal persons and requires medical practitioners present for such births to \"exercise the same degree of professional skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child as a reasonably diligent and conscientious health care practitioner would render to any other child born alive at the same gestational age.\"\n\nIt lays out penalties of fines and up to five years in prison for medical practitioners who do not follow the legislation's requirements, and it protects mothers of infants born alive after abortions from similar prosecution.\n\nWhen the House considered the same bill as an amendment to a different measure in 2020, three Democrats joined Republicans in supporting it. Those three Democrats are no longer in Congress, though. It's unclear if any new Democratic members may cross the aisle to support it.\n\nA full list of bills the House may consider this week, including immigration bills and law enforcement messaging legislation, is available here .\n\nMy colleague Audrey has a piece on the site today diving into a McCarthy-aligned campaign fund's agreement not to spend in safe GOP districts in open primaries. She writes:\n\nThe deal proved pivotal to winning over 20 Republican holdouts, many of whom McCarthy-aligned donors earlier had opposed in GOP primaries. The pledge was also a blatant power play from the Club for Growth, as it could result in more Freedom Caucus-style candidates making it through Republican primaries and into the House-further weakening McCarthy's hand in future negotiations with his own party.\n\nBut some members, like Rep. Lauren Boebert, aren't entirely convinced it will be impactful for conservatives.\n\n\"I think they're liars,\" Boebert told The Dispatch of the deal last week. Audrey notes:\n\nIt's unclear how much of an effect CLF's concession will have on the next campaign cycle, considering the super PAC \"will continue to support incumbents in primaries as well as challengers in districts that affect the Majority, which proved to be critical to winning the Majority in 2022,\" per the deal. There's also no clear definition of what the CLF means by open and \"safe\" Republican districts.\n\nRead more here .\n\nGOP House takes first swipe at IRS money\n\nUnpacking the House GOP's new rules: A handy guide to the changes\n\nJustice Dept. reviewing classified documents found in Biden's post-VP office\n\nProgressive Caucus starts year with bigger roster, focus on unity\n\nHaley Wilt is a former associate editor for The Dispatch.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "The Agonizingly Low Stakes of Today's Vote for House Speaker\n\nIt's a bad job at a bad time for the party.\n\nThe reason there is so much drama around the question of the House speakership vote today is that it's an extremely low-stakes contest, at least for everyone other than Rep. Kevin McCarthy.\n\nThe Republicans' itty-bitty House majority will instantly obtain most of the possible advantages for the GOP-a blockade of any Democratic initiatives in the second half of President Biden's term, control of congressional committees by their most-senior Republican members, and the power to set the House schedule-regardless of who wins today or in the days to come. Whether it is McCarthy or anyone else, the potential advantages for the party pretty much end there.\n\nWhen your party controls the lower half of one branch of the government, you don't do much of anything. And when you control that half of a branch by just five votes-a 1.03 percent advantage-you do your best just to hold on. But the speeches you hear today will suggest that there are serious consequences to whether McCarthy or someone else has the profoundly dubious privilege of wielding what will be a feather-light speaker's gavel. These people are either full of it, or so stricken with Potomac fever that they're hallucinating.\n\nThe arguments have and will center on who can best \"stop the Biden-Harris agenda\" or some other focus-group-whittled phrase. Voters already did that in November, insofar as Democrats hadn't already done it to themselves in their own delusional infighting of the previous two years. The rest of the talking points will come down to \"messaging,\" i.e., talking points about talking points. Who gets to decide which politicized hearings to hold and who gets to go on TV with more-important-sounding titles are matters of little consequence. Voters will continue to correctly understand that these things should mostly be ignored.\n\nBut I hear you saying, \"What if one of the real lulus gets to be speaker of the House?\" What if Rep. Andy Biggs-Publishers' Clearing House winner, K-Pop beefer , staunch foe of Swedish NATO membership, and author of The Doctrine of Liberty: Insights From the Book of Mormon -becomes third in line for the presidency and gets to go sit in the photo-ops they convene when pretending to have meetings about fiscal cliffs and whatnot?\n\nIf by some freak accident it did happen, it probably wouldn't matter much in the administration of government. A kooky speaker with a barely there majority and the Senate and White House in the hands of the other party would be easy enough to maneuver around until he was ultimately ousted by his own party. Which brings us to the second point: It won't happen.\n\nThe mantra from McCarthy and his team has been \"only Kevin,\" which is certainly true, but only in answer to the right question: Which member of leadership is willing to humiliate himself in a series of Fear Factor- like challenges to win the votes of people who openly despise him in order to get a truly terrible job? Only Kevin, indeed.\n\nBut, if McCarthy isn't able to get it done on the first ballot, it won't be a mega-MAGA radical who wins. The next in line would be Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana and then Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York. If McCarthy is thwarted, the next frontrunner will get there in minutes, not over the course of four agonizing years. That makes the job more appealing and the bargaining easier. Either Scalise or Stefanik could get the majority of the caucus behind them, and little advantage to the Biggs five for staying united as Democrats celebrated Republican dysfunction so potent that it triggered only the second multi-ballot speaker election since the Civil War. The holdouts would have their scalp and would happily declare victory.\n\nIf you doubt it, just think of this: The leaders of the various caucuses of the Republican Conference of the U.S. House of Representatives have a weekly meeting they refer to as the \" Five Families ,\" an homage to the Profaci, Mangano, Luciano, Maranzano, and Gagliano organized crime families of New York who tried to share control of the city's criminal underworld from the 1930s until the 1980s. Aside from the whole brutal-mobster part of it, this is such an odd thing to say because they were frequently engaged in murderous wars with each other . But most of all, it tells us that these are, again, not serious people with useful understandings of how legislative power is exercised.\n\nMcCarthy's new enforcer, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, loves the term . But while she may imagine that the Freedom Caucus is powerful like a mafia don, that's not what's happening here.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus is made up of MAGA hucksters like Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida and Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado along with longtime members who date back to the caucus' Tea Party origins, like Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, as well as serious radicals from the Doug Mastraiano-wing of the GOP, like the group's new chairman, Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. They are in many ways the reactionary heirs of the John Birchers of previous generations: cranky , confrontational , and often paranoid . Not surprisingly, the group is secretive in its operations, factious among itself, and bombastic in its pronouncements, but it seems that there are probably at least 40 members. It seems equally clear that they cannot function in favor of anything other than chaos.\n\nWhat about the second \"family,\" the Republican Study Committee? These are the grandchildren of the Gingrich Revolution, but without the real rebellion of their forebears. With about 160 members, the RSC is about as mainstream as it gets in the GOP: Too big to be decisive and too diverse to be dangerous. The résumé polishers who fill out the ranks tend to be Tracy Flicks these days. The new chairman, Rep. Kevin Hearn, a successful McDonald's franchisee from Tulsa, has been in Congress for only four years. Not exactly Lucky Luciano.\n\nTwo of the other \"families,\" the Republican Main Street Caucus, led by Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota, and the Republican Governance Group, led by Rep. Dave Joyce of Ohio, together comprise maybe 70 or so members with lots of overlap between them. These are the traditional Chamber of Commerce kind of pro-business Republicans, many from swing suburban districts who are interested in showing legislative success. The fifth \"family\" is the Republican side of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, led by Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania. Lots of overlap here, too, with members like Rep. David Valadao on the rolls of all three of the more moderate groups.\n\nThese men aren't bosses, and a weekly gum-suck in the leadership offices is not a summit between powerful factions. It's a calendar filler and a public-facing effort to show solidarity, not a place for meaningful negotiations. People who don't understand those things aren't likely to understand the real consequences of today's vote and the actual situation of the Republican Party, circa 2023.\n\nIf the stakes were higher-if there was a big House majority and a Republican Senate and/or White House-we would be seeing a much different fight for the speakership. That would really be a job worth having. Not only would the kook caucus be less powerful in a big majority and therefore less able to make extortionate demands, the speaker could actually set an agenda and make a mark. For the next House speaker, the marks will mostly be left on them. It's a bad job at a bad time for the party-the white elephant prize, if you'll excuse me.\n\nSeldom has Samuel Johnson's line-\"small things make mean men proud, and vanity catches small occasions\"-fit better.\n\nChris Stirewalt is a contributing writer for The Dispatch, the politics editor for The Hill and NewsNation, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, co-host of the Ink Stained Wretches podcast, and author of Broken News, a book on media and politics.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., argues Democrats focusing on January 6th is a distraction from their failed policies.\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., discussed the 2022 midterm elections as voter popularity favors the GOP in the latest polls. Boebert urged Republicans running as conservatives not to \"govern like Democrats\" on \"Mornings with Maria\" Tuesday.\n\nREP. LAUREN BOEBERT: It is all been a witch hunt for years and they [Democrats] just find something new to focus on. First it was Russia, Russia, Russia, and now it's January 6th. That has completely changed the focus for the Democrat Party. But it's all a distraction from their failed policies. Americans are paying the price for Democrat policies. We've been under Democrat rule for one and a half years now, and it has done nothing but harm the American people. It is difficult to find work. It is difficult to find employees. It is hard to put food on the table and even arrive at your job paying over $5 a gallon for gas .\n\nRep.

And they see the damage that Biden has caused, and they want change. And the only way Republicans can really mess this up is if we start acting like Democrats. So that's why in the House Freedom Caucus, we fully intend to make sure whoever is leading the GOP does what they promised. We cannot run as conservatives and govern as Democrats. Conservative policies work, and we Republicans need to govern that way.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nWATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW BELOW:\n\nRep.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - A firearms-toting congresswoman-elect who owns a gun-themed restaurant in Rifle, Colorado, has already asked Capitol Police about carrying her weapon on Capitol grounds, her office has acknowledged. If she does so, she apparently won't be alone.\n\nThe practice is allowed for lawmakers, with some limitations, under decades-old congressional regulations. The public is barred from carrying weapons in the Capitol, its grounds and office buildings.\n\nFILE - Lauren Boebert, the Republican candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives seat in Colorado's vast 3rd Congressional District, during a freedom cruise staged by her supporters in Pueblo West, Colo. An aide to Boebert, a firearms-toting con\n\nRepublican Lauren Boebert , 33, was elected this month from a conservative western Colorado district after gaining notice as a brash pro-gun activist who straps a Glock pistol to her hip. In an upset last June, she defeated five-term Rep. Scott Tipton for the GOP nomination, in part by claiming he wasn't an ardent enough backer of President Donald Trump .\n\nBoebert asked Capitol Police officials about carrying her weapon when she and other House freshmen taking office in January were in town recently for orientation programs, according to two congressional officials. Both people - a Democrat and a Republican - spoke on condition of anonymity to describe her request.\n\nAides to Boebert, who Trump endorsed as \"a fighter\" who will \"never bow down to the establishment in Congress,\" did not make her available for an interview.\n\n\"This was a private discussion and inquiry about what the rules are, and as a result the Congresswoman-Elect won't be going on the record,\" Boebert aide Laura Carno said in an email last week.\n\nThe inquiries by Boebert, who runs Shooters Grill, come as guns remain a passionate issue for both parties, fueled by images of demonstrations by armed Trump supporters , conservative pushes to ease state gun restrictions and recent years' mass shootings.\n\nEven so, prospects for significantly changing federal gun laws seem scant as a new, narrowly divided Congress takes office in January alongside President-elect Joe Biden .\n\nUS GUN IMPORTS BOOM IN 2020\n\nCapitol Police spokeswoman Eva Malecki did not respond to a reporter's questions about the department's communications with Boebert and the number of lawmakers who carry firearms.\n\nThe agency's officials did not answer directly when Democrats on the House Committee on Administration asked in 2018 how many lawmakers carry firearms in the Capitol. The officials said in a written response that they've \"been made aware\" of inquiries about carrying weapons.\n\n\"There is no standing requirement\" that lawmakers notify them when they carry a firearm in the Capitol, the officials wrote. Regulations require safe storage of weapons, but \"that responsibility resides with the Member,\" they said.\n\nA 1967 regulation says no federal or District of Columbia laws restricting firearms \"shall prohibit any Member of Congress from maintaining firearms within the confines of his office\" or \"from transporting within Capitol grounds firearms unloaded and securely wrapped.\"\n\nFILE - In this Sept. 4, 2020, file photo Lauren Boebert, the Republican candidate for the U.S. House of Representatives seat in Colorado's vast 3rd Congressional District, during a freedom cruise staged by her supporters in Pueblo West, Colo. An aide\n\nLawmakers may not bring weapons into the House chamber and other nearby areas, the regulations say, according to a letter Rep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., wrote in 2018. Aides can carry lawmakers' weapons for them on the Capitol complex, he wrote.\n\nIn his letter to House Sergeant at Arms Paul Irving, Huffman summarized the regulations after being briefed on them by Irving. An opponent of letting members of Congress carry guns on Capitol grounds, Huffman abandoned a 2018 effort to halt the practice due to colleagues' strong opposition and said in an interview that he wouldn't try again this year due to continued resistance.\n\nHuffman said the loophole for lawmakers, adopted after a summer of racial unrest in American cities, is outdated and risky.\n\nHe said members and their staffs carry firearms around the Capitol \"all the time,\" though he mentioned no names. He said lawmakers keep guns in their publicly accessible offices, though building entry has been limited due to COVID-19.\n\n\"Members could have a loaded AK47 sitting on their desk and no one would ever do anything about it,\" Huffman said.\n\nHe also said with lawmakers exempted from passing through screening devices throughout the Capitol campus, \"no one checks\" to make sure they're not bringing guns onto the House floor.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., chairman of the House Second Amendment Caucus, justified letting lawmakers carry weapons. He cited the 2017 shooting spree when a gunman wounded Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., and four other people as they practiced baseball in nearby Alexandria, Virginia.\n\n\"As soon as you leave the Capitol property, you are a target,\" Massie said.\n\nAlso supporting Boebert is Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., like Boebert a hard-right conservative with a penchant for attracting publicity. Greene like Boebert has expressed support for QAnon conspiracy theories, though both have tried distancing themselves from the unfounded beliefs.\n\n\"Not only do I support members of Congress carrying a firearm, I believe every American has that right.\" Greene said in a statement. \"I will work every day to end ALL gun free zones.\"\n\nPolice periodically arrest people caught trying to bring firearms into the Capitol and its buildings.\n\nIn 1999, Corey Lewandowski - then a congressional aide and later a manager of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign - was arrested when what court records called a loaded pistol was found in a laundry bag he was bringing into a House office building. Misdemeanor charges were dismissed.\n\nThe Capitol Police protect the complex with over 2,300 officers and civilian employees, according to its website. Its officers routinely arrest people caught trying to carry weapons at the Capitol.\n\nThe regulations letting lawmakers carry guns was written by the Capitol Police Board, which consists of four of Congress' top law enforcement and administrative officials.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nGet a brief on the top business stories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.\n\nWe've added you to our mailing list.\n\nBy clicking subscribe, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

      "text": "GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert wins election to US House in Colorado's 4th Congressional District\n\nWINDSOR, Colo. - Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert won a House seat Tuesday in a Colorado district where she moved midway through her term to avoid what would have been a tough reelection bid in her old district.\n\nBoebert, a rabble-rouser who's helped define an ultra-conservative flank of the U.S. House, took a gamble in moving races, and it paid off. Boebert beat Trisha Calvarese, the former director of speech writing and publications at the AFL-CIO, a federation of labor unions, who called herself an \"old-school labor Democrat.\"\n\nBoebert had held the 3rd Congressional District seat in the Rocky Mountains since 2020. She left for the more conservative 4th Congressional District on the Great Plains after surveillance video emerged of her vaping and groping a date at a Denver theater. She initially explained her move by saying, \"There is a need for my voice in Congress,\" and later said she needed a fresh start for her family after after a messy divorce.\n\nFollow The Post's live updates on the 2024 election for the latest reactions, news and more\n\nIn doing so, she escaped what would have been a tough rematch against a Democrat who nearly unseated her in 2022. Adam Frisch lost that election to Boebert by just 546 votes, campaigning against what he dubbed her \"angertainment.\"\n\nDuring the Republican primary in the 4th District, Boebert avoided a surprise political threat with some behind-the-scenes jostling and fended off accusations of carpetbagging from her opponent and glancing references to her embarrassing moment at the Denver theater.\n\nEventually with six candidates left, Boebert's well-known political brand and endorsement from presidential candidate Donald Trump helped pull her to victory in the primary, and now the general election.\n\nBoebert will be filling Republican Rep. Ken Buck's old seat. When Buck resigned, the conservative cited a flank of the Republican Party's hardheaded politics and unwavering devotion to Trump - traits that made Boebert a name brand.\n\nBoebert has said that her intractable politics - stonewalling the January 2023 vote to elect Rep. Kevin McCarthy as House speaker for a series of concessions, for example - are promises kept on the campaign trail.\n\nWearing a \"Make America Great Again\" baseball cap with presidential candidate Donald Trump's signature across the bill, Boebert addressed the crowd at her watch party in the northern Colorado city of Windsor just before polls closed.\n\n\"I have taken on every swamp creature in Washington, D.C.,\" Boebert told the buzzing crowd, \"but ya'll have sent someone to Congress who is tougher than the teeth of the crocodiles and the fangs of the snakes.\"\n\nSome questions remain as to whether Boebert's withdrawal from her old district was enough for Republicans to hold onto the seat. The Democratic candidate, Adam Frisch, had already pulled in an astounding number of donations for a non-incumbent before Boebert departed, fundraising off of his near success in beating her in 2022.\n\nThe thrust of Frisch's campaign was to \"stop the circus,\" dubbing Boebert's style \"angertainment.\" Without the congresswoman as political foil, Frisch has fallen back onto his politically moderate platform, emphasizing that he will be a voice for rural constituents and take a bipartisan approach to policy.\n\nFrisch, a former Aspen councilman and currency trader, still has one of the largest House campaign chests in the country. It far overshadows GOP candidate Jeff Hurd's coffers.\n\nIt's unclear how much that will make a difference. The district still leans red, and Hurd, an attorney, is a more temperate conservative than his predecessor, with fewer gaffs. Hurd has said his goal is to make local headlines instead of national ones. The \"R\" next to his name on the ballot might be all that's needed."

Lauren Boebert has been hiding a massive stomach tattoo that explodes from her pelvic bone and stretches up her torso to her ribs, a shocking new photo shows.\n\nA revealing bikini pic showcasing the Republican congresswoman's secret ink was exposed Thursday by her colleague Rep.

Anna Paulina Luna, whose years-old swimsuit pics went viral this week .\n\n\"We love confident, healthy, patriotic women like Lauren,\" Ginger Gaetz wrote on X, along with a bikini emoji.\n\nIn the picture, Boebert, 37 - who was thrown out of a Denver theater nearly a year ago for groping her date - appears smiling while standing on the shoreline of West Palm Beach.\n\nShe sports a dark blue bikini top paired with slim, cheetah print bottoms adorned with gold accent rings.\n\nA sprawling tribal tattoo connected the bathing suit top and bottoms, seemingly originating from Boebert's pelvic bone and nearly covering the entire right side of her abdomen.\n\nIt's not clear when the image was taken, but the Colorado Republican's left hand sparkled with her engagement ring - she and her sex-pest husband announced plans to divorce in May 2023.\n\nThe scandalous tweet was viewed more than 1 million times and garnered both support and criticism for Boebert, with some calling her tattoo \"trashy.\"\n\nIt's not clear how the congresswoman felt about the wife of her colleague - who amplified the bikini shot on his own page - sharing the revealing image.\n\n\"Well then...there's that!\" Boebert tweeted in reply.\n\nBoebert did not respond to The Post's request for comment.\n\nLuna, 35, sported a MAGA-themed suit in a 2016 video to show her support for Donald Trump before she began serving in the House of Representatives at the start of last year.\n\nLuna leaned into the social media stir and took the opportunity to mock transgender people.\n\n\"I'm confirming that I have indeed worn swimsuits and you can tell I am biologically a woman,\" she snarked on X with the hashtag \"MAGA.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

Ken Buck (R-Colo.) retired.\n\nThat switch also came after her \"unruly\" behavior at a Denver production of the musical \"Beetlejuice\" in September 2023, when she was caught vaping and groping her date before being ejected .\n\nBoebert's principal campaign committee the same month recorded more than $1.4 million in its campaign war chest, which has declined since then to just over half a million - with more than $500,000 being siphoned from PACs and other committees\n\nAdvertisement"

Lauren Boebert flipped out at the moderator of a Republican primary debate after he asked her about her frisky \"Beetlejuice\" groping session last September - blaming him for putting her \"very private moment\" on display for the world to see.\n\n9News Denver's Kyle Clark broached the touchy subject with Boebert (R-Colo.) on Friday, and her response was to fire back at him.\n\n\"I'm apologizing for you, Kyle Clark getting footage and releasing that - people seeing this in a very private moment,\" Boebert said.\n\n\"You were saying how disgusting it is to record someone without their knowledge and you did that very same thing in releasing [the footage],\" she added, referencing a recent interview Clark did.\n\nLast September, Boebert and Quinn Gallagher, her then-beau, were booted from a \"Beetlejuice\" showing in Denver, Colorado, after getting very handsy with each other , blowing a plume of vape smoke into the air and otherwise making a scene.\n\nTheater officials expressed concerns about the duo snapping photos in violation of theater policy.\n\nInitially, Boebert's team denied the theater's claim that she vaped, but then Clark reported that his station acquired the surveillance footage proving she did.\n\nBoebert was then forced to apologize. She also later confirmed that her fling with Gallagher was over.\n\n\"I certainly have owned up to my night out in Denver, and I've gone on that public apology tour, and I'm grateful for the mercy and grace that have been shown, but I'm not going to continue to live life in shame and continue to be beat up by this,\" Boebert contended during the debate.\n\nClark pressed her over whether she apologized to \"voters for what you did that night and the disrespect you showed to service workers.\"\n\n\"I don't believe there was disrespect. I believe things were taken out of context,\" Boebert countered. \"It's been reported that I flipped someone off and I did not. So I think it's been mischaracterized.\"\n\nImages from the theater's security footage show Boebert pointing a finger at the ushers as she left the theater. It's difficult to tell whether it was her middle finger.\n\nEven before the infamous \"Beetlejuice\" outing, Boebert had been in turbulent waters politically. She barely won re-election in 2022 in the ruby-red 3rd District of Colorado with a meager 546 votes over Democrat Adam Frisch.\n\nAfter the \"Beetlejuice\" controversy, Boebert announced that she would hop over to the 4th District. That got complicated when former Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.) stepped down early last year.\n\nBoebert declined to compete in the June 25 special election for Buck's seat.\n\nShe is facing a fairly crowded race for the 4th District with about half a dozen contenders. The primary is slated for June 25.\n\n\"Well, it's interesting to hear Democrat talking points from my Republican opponents,\" Boebert shot back during the debate as she fended off attacks against her record.\n\n\"I do not believe that will make this seat vulnerable. This is a Republican district and they want a Republican who has a 100% conservative voting record, as I do.\"\n\nAt another point in the debate, Clark grilled her for boasting about funding she brought home to her district for various projects - despite her voting against legislation allocating that money.\n\n\"Yes and I would've worked ... for a process to get that over the line,\" she said when asked whether she still would've voted \"no\" on them. \"I have had over 80 initiatives signed into law.\"\n\nBoebert has faced a string of controversies in her personal life since ascending to Congress in 2021.\n\nThe 37-year-old grandma's son Tyler was charged back in February for contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\n\nThe Colorado rep enjoys the backing of former President Donald Trump, who hailed her as a \"trusted America First Fighter\" in a March endorsement.\n\nHer primary contest comes as Republicans have a slim 217-213 majority in the lower chamber and are scrambling to retain control during the 2024 election cycle.\n\nAdvertisement"

Lauren Boebert and her family have frequently made headlines that seemed ripped out of a soap opera.\n\nThe 37-year-old Republican Freedom Caucus firebrand is a high school dropout who had been arrested multiple times before her stunning rise to power in 2020, and her ex-husband had been arrested several times since.\n\nNow her oldest son Tyler, 18, is following in his parents' criminal footsteps , facing 22 charges, including five felonies, in connection with a string of alleged thefts in Rifle, Colo., outside of Aspen.\n\nThe teen had previously been ticketed in 2022 for \"careless driving causing bodily injury,\" after he flipped his father's SUV into a creek, seriously injuring his friend, who accused his mother of trying to cover up the incident.\n\nBoebert has drawn gasps in political circles for outrageous statements, slurs against political opponents and promoting conspiracy theories, but even more ink has been spilled on the unsavory personal moments surrounding her and her family.\n\nHere is a look back at some of them, as Boebert mounts a bid for a third term in Colorado's Fourth Congressional District, which is more GOP-friendly than the Third District , where she was twice elected.\n\nLauren and her three minor children were granted a restraining order against her ex-husband Jayson Boebert earlier this year after he \"made multiple suicidal threats and threats to harm me over the past 14 months,\" the congresswoman reportedly claimed in February .\n\nThe order was granted a month after Jayson was arrested in two incidents for third-degree assault, prohibited use of weapons, obstructing a peace officer, harassment, disorderly conduct and third-degree trespassing.\n\nJayson had called police to a Silt restaurant on Jan. 6 after a fight with Lauren and Tyler, alleging Lauren had punched him in the face , a claim she denied.\n\nSilt Police later said it took eight officers to pull him out of the restaurant.\n\nThree days later, Jayson was charged with attacking Tyler , allegedly digging his thumb into the teen's mouth as if he was \"going to pull his tooth out\" in a drunken rage before grabbing a rifle, according to a police report.\n\nJayson's brushes with the law date back to January 2004, when he allegedly exposed his penis to two women at a bowling alley in the presence of his future wife, then 17 and known as Lauren Opal Roberts.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to public indecency and lewd exposure.\n\nA month later, he was arrested for attacking Lauren.\n\nHe \"did unlawfully strike, shove or kick ... and subjected her to physical contact,\" Garfield County officials confirmed.\n\nJayson served a total of 11 days in jail in connection with the incidents.\n\nThree months after Jayson was convicted in connection with an attack on Lauren in 2004, she was slapped with third-degree assault, criminal mischief and underage drinking charges for allegedly scratching his face and chest and trashing his residence, according to a police report.\n\nIn September 2010, Lauren was arrested after a neighbor said her two pit bulls attacked her dog , who narrowly escaped injury after jumping into a van.\n\nThe future legislator pleaded guilty to a single count of \"dog at large,\" paying a $75 fine.\n\nIn 2015, Boebert was arrested for disorderly conduct at a country music festival, where police said she attempted to interfere in the arrest of minors busted for underage drinking and encouraged the accused youths to run off, claiming the arrest was illegal because they had not been read their Miranda rights.\n\n\"Lauren continued yelling and causing the underage drinkers to become unruly,\" an arresting officer said in a statement at the time.\n\n\"Lauren said multiple times that she had friends at Fox News and that the illegal arrest would be national news.\"\n\nA year later, she was charged with careless driving and operating an unsafe vehicle after rolling her truck into a ditch, an act which would later be replicated by her teenage son.\n\nA warrant was issued for her arrest when she failed to show up to court, but she ultimately pleaded guilty to the unsafe vehicle charge and paid $123.50 in fines and court costs, according to the Colorado Times Recorder .\n\nAfter being elevated to Congress in 2021, the mother of four tussled with Capitol Police officers after refusing to walk through metal detectors on Capitol Hill, claiming she was \"legally permitted to carry my firearm in Washington.\"\n\nBoebert and her Glock were eventually allowed in.\n\nThe incident came just days after the deadly Jan. 6 riot , the day Joe Biden's election was to be certified - which Boebert and other Republicans had stated they would not vote for over then-President Donald Trump's false claims of election fraud.\n\nHours before supporters of Trump stormed the complex, Boebert tweeted, \" today is 1776 .\"\n\nShe also took to the platform now known as X to reveal that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had been removed from the Capitol as hoards of suspects were \"coming for\" the Democrat.\n\nAs her marriage unraveled, the lawmaker - who once urged Americans to \" Take your children to CHURCH, not drag bars \" - was dating a registered Democrat who co-owns an LGBTQ-friendly bar that hosts a drag queen night .\n\nThe relationship with Quinn Gallagher made headlines after the pair were recorded groping each other's private parts while attending a theatrical performance of the musical \"Beetlejuice\" in Denver in September.\n\nSecurity escorted the couple out of the theater for vaping, singing, recording and \"causing a disturbance\" during the performance.\n\nBoebert later said she got \"a little bit\" carried away , noting that \"it's been 20 years since I was in the dating scene.\"\n\nThe \"brief\" fling with Gallagher ended due to their political differences, she said.\n\nBefore Boebert steamrolled into the national spotlight as a pro-gun, anti-abortion MAGA cheerleader, she and Jayson owned Shooters Grill restaurant in Rifle, where she encouraged servers to carry guns openly.\n\nThe business lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2019 and 2020, according to campaign disclosure forms, and became the subject of controversy when she opened it in violation of Colorado's stay-at-home order in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in its food license being temporarily suspended.\n\nThe restaurant closed in 2022 when a new landlord declined to renew its lease.\n\nThe wife of a former Shooters chef claimed that Boebert seduced him while they were married.\n\nBoth parties denied the affair.\n\nStay up on the very latest with Evening Update.\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nLast year, Boebert announced that Tyler, then 17, had fathered a child with a 15-year-old out of wedlock.\n\nLauren had also given birth to Tyler when she was in high school.\n\nShe dropped out and received a GED online only as she mounted a campaign for her first term in Congress.\n\n\"When I approached him and told him, 'Tyler, I'm going to be a 36-year-old grandmother,' he said, 'Well, didn't you make Granny a 36-year-old granny?\"' Boebert said in 2023.\n\nBoebert herself was born illegitimately to a teen mom and does not know who her father is.\n\nHer mother named pro wrestler Stan Lane as the father, but two paternity tests taken by Lane decades apart proved he was not .\n\n\"My mom was 18 when she had me, which inspired me to be a mother when I was 18 years old,\" she said.\n\nWith Post wires\n\nAdvertisement"

So just keep the jokes at bay, and maybe we'll just stick with the Gulf of America for now,\" Boebert said.\n\nThe District of Columbia was named in 1791, along with Washington, the city chosen as the nation's capital. Washington was named after the first U.S. president, George Washington, while \"Columbia\" refers to explorer Christopher Columbus, who is credited with discovering the Americas in 1492.\n\nMAPQUEST TROLLS TRUMP WITH 'NAME YOUR OWN GULF' WEBSITE\n\nThe Gulf of America name change has been limited in its acceptance. Government agencies and some map services complied with the order domestically, while some news bureaus, such as the Associated Press , kept the name Gulf of Mexico in copy.\n\nTrump heralded the name change as a key action early in his second term, displaying a map featuring the Gulf of America in the Oval Office and declaring Feb. 9 Gulf of America Day."

      "text": "Lauren Boebert's district swap is gift to GOP, but reelection obstacles remain\n\nR epublicans are in a slightly stronger position to defend their House majority after Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) announced she would switch districts next year, boosting the party's chances of holding on to the contested seat. But challenges remain for Boebert to stay in office.\n\nIn a bombshell announcement on Wednesday, Boebert announced she would not seek reelection in Colorado's 3rd Congressional District and instead run to represent the 4th Congressional District on the opposite side of the state. Her departure from the race improves Republicans' chances of holding on to the seat, shifting the district from a \"toss-up\" to \"lean Republican,\" according to the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.\n\nTWELVE DAYS OF WEX-MAS: HOW SERIOUS IS BIDEN ABOUT FIXING THE BORDER IN 2024?\n\nThe shift gives Republicans a slight advantage in holding on to their slim majority next year as it reduces the number of GOP-held toss-up districts to just 14. Democrats have 10 toss-up districts in the 2024 cycle.\n\nBoebert's absence from the race also paves the way for centrist Republican Jeff Hurd, an attorney from Grand Junction, to face off against Democratic challenger Adam Frisch, whom Boebert narrowly defeated in 2022. Frisch posed a strong challenge to the incumbent, losing by only 546 votes and vastly outraising her thus far in the 2024 cycle.\n\nAlthough Boebert's move shifts the direction in Republicans' direction, Frisch maintained confidence in his prospects.\n\n\"We have one of the greatest name ID, fundraising, and district-wide relationship advantages from any challenger in the country,\" Frisch told the Washington Examiner. \"From Day One of this race, I have been squarely focused on defending rural Colorado's way of life and offering common sense solutions to the problems facing the families of Colorado's 3rd Congressional District. My focus will remain the same, and I look forward to bringing these issues with me to Congress in 2024.\"\n\nBoebert still faces an uphill battle to maintain a spot in Congress as she shifts her focus to Colorado's 4th Congressional District. The seat is held by Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), who announced in November that he would not seek reelection, citing frustrations with his Republican colleagues in the House.\n\nBuck's retirement has already attracted a crowded field of Republicans seeking to replace the four-term incumbent, meaning Boebert must face at least six challengers to secure the party nomination. One Republican candidate has already hit out against Boebert for making the switch, criticizing her for opting to run in a district where she does not currently live.\n\n\"Seat shopping isn't something the voters look kindly upon,\" state Rep. Richard Holtorf said in a statement. \"If you can't win in your home, you can't win here.\"\n\nBoebert lives in the 3rd District where she currently holds her congressional seat. Colorado law does not dictate that candidates must live in the same districts in which they campaign. However, Boebert said she plans to move to the 4th District sometime in 2024 and \"proudly represent\" it.\n\nBoebert also must grapple with a handful of personal controversies over the last few months, which the congresswoman alluded to in her statement explaining the shift.\n\n\"Personally, this announcement is a fresh start following a pretty difficult year for me and my family,\" she said, referring to her divorce that was finalized earlier this year.\n\nBoebert also attracted controversy after she was escorted out of a Denver production of Beetlejuice for being disruptive. Video footage of the incident was later released showing the Colorado Republican vaping, talking on the phone, and at one point groping the man who was accompanying her.\n\nAll 435 seats are up for grabs in 2024 as Republicans seek to hold their slim majority in the lower chamber. Forty-five seats are considered competitive, most of which Democrats hold, giving the GOP a slight advantage as it prepares for the next election cycle.\n\nHowever, of the 45 competitive seats, Republicans hold 17 in districts that voted for President Joe Biden in 2020, compared to just five Democrats who must defend their seats in districts former President Donald Trump carried."

Frisch conceded the race to Hurd on Wednesday before the Associated Press called the race, saying in a statement that while he did not win, his campaign was \"part of an important movement that seeks to turn the political temperature down and start focusing on the real challenges that face communities like the ones in CD3.\"\n\n\"Everyday people are sick of partisan politics as usual, and the vast majority of people view themselves first and foremost as Coloradans - not Republicans or Democrats - who want both parties to stop the petty arguments and political grandstanding and start working together to help make everyone's lives better!\" Frisch continued. Hurd responded to Frisch's concession publically shortly after, thanking the Colorado Democrat for running a campaign that \"engaged voters\" across the district.\n\n\"Elections are about more than any single candidate - they're about ensuring that every voter's voice is counted and that our shared values as Coloradans are upheld. I got into this race to ensure that our rural communities are not forgotten, and that western and southern Colorado thrive. It will be an honor and privilege to represent the district where I was raised,\" Hurd said in a statement.\n\nThis is the second loss for Frisch, who came close to ousting Boebert in the 2022 midterm elections but lost by a razor-thin margin. With Boebert as the leading Republican candidate in the 3rd District, the race was rated a \"toss-up\" by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report . However, the race shifted back to \"lean Republican\" when she moved districts.\n\nBoebert shifted to Colorado's 4th Congressional District, which was left vacant by retired Republican Rep.

      "text": "Rocky Mountain try: GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert seeks reelection on the other side of Colorado\n\nIt's a five-hour, 350-mile drive from Rifle, Colorado, where Rep. Lauren Boebert once owned and ran the Second Amendment -themed Shooters Grill restaurant, to the small municipality of Holyoke, in the state's northeastern corner. Boebert is betting the political distance isn't so vast.\n\nBoebert, a high-profile House Republican and one of former President Donald Trump's staunchest defenders in Congress, is leaving the Pueblo area and Western Slope 3rd Congressional District. She's moving clear cross-state, running for reelection in the eastern Colorado and Denver exurbs 4th Congressional District, effectively trying to trade a conservative-leaning yet increasingly purplish district straddling Colorado's entire western state line, with Utah, for a deep-red constituency whose deep-red politics more mirror those of neighboring Kansas and Nebraska.\n\nBoebert, first elected to the House in 2020 after upsetting a 10-year incumbent in the Republican primary, is moving after seeming to wear out her welcome in western Colorado. In 2022, she beat Democratic rival Adam Frisch 50.1% to 49.%, or 546 votes out of more than 327,000 cast. That in a district where in 2020 Trump would have beaten President Joe Biden 52.9% to 44.7%. Frisch, a businessman and former member of the Aspen City Council, is running again, with Colorado's congressional primaries on June 25.\n\nBoebert made a name for herself nationally soon after joining Congress three years ago. Her controversies included resisting mask and vaccine mandates in the House chamber, which earned her a $500 fine from the House Ethics Committee. She set off metal detectors at the entrance to the House floor by refusing to part with her gun, causing a dispute with Capitol Police. Boebert also amplified Trump's baseless election fraud claims, tweeting that \"today is 1776\" on the day of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Democrats seethed at Boebert's behavior and have an even longer bill of particulars about her outrages, which they deem unbecoming a member of Congress.\n\nYet Boebert's political prospects took on a more dire tone after a September incident in which she was escorted out of a Denver performance of Beetlejuice for vaping, groping her companion, and generally causing a disturbance. Social media and late-night comics ran wild with jokes about Boebert's \"hands-on\" brand of politics and the like.\n\nA new constituency\n\nThe 4th Congressional District seat is open because Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) is retiring after eight years. Voters there would have backed Trump over Biden 58% to 39.%. So, winning the Republican primary is all that matters to nab the open seat.\n\nThe next five months will test how much of a desire there is by voters for Boebert's brand of performative politics. Several prominent Republicans also are seeking their party's nod. That includes Mara Bailey, a former congressional aide; former state Sen. Ted Harvey; state Rep. Richard Holtorf; Weld County Councilman Trent Leisy; state House Minority Leader Mike Lynch; businessman and former congressional aide Chris Phelan; and Logan County Commissioner Jerry Sonnenberg, who previously was a member of both chambers in the state legislature.\n\nEach rival candidate to Boebert brings his or her own MAGA-esque credentials to the Republican primary. And the bulk of them have held public office for years in the region.\n\nAs for Democrat Frisch back in the 3rd Congressional District, his candidacy could go a couple of ways. It's still possible Frisch could win. After all, Frisch raised a ton of money, and even if his fundraising doesn't continue at stratospheric levels now that Boebert's out of the race, he'll still have the necessary resources to wage a competitive race.\n\nMoreover, while the congressional district has a distinct Republican tilt, it's not insurmountable. The district also includes several Denver suburbs and exurbs, which are growing increasingly blue.\n\n\"Adam is running to make sure his district has real representation in Congress. We're going to help him finish the job and put the House back to work for the American people, not political extremists,\" Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-WA) posted on X , formerly Twitter, on Dec. 28.\n\nAnd another 2024 Democratic House candidate, Will Rollins, running in the inland Southern California 41st Congressional District, told the Washington Examiner in an interview that Frisch was a model for others challenging Republican opponents. Rollins credited Frisch with coining the term \"Angertainment\" about right-win provocateurs in the House, such as Boebert and Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Matt Gaetz (R-FL).\n\nStill, Frisch could wind up like the would-be 2014 challenger to then-Rep. Michele Bachmann (R-MN). Bachmann, like Boebert, was a telegenic conservative female House member with a knack for drawing national attention. Bachmann became a Tea Party-era star about halfway through her 2007-15 House tenure as Republicans won a majority in the chamber.\n\nBut Bachmann flew too close to the sun politically. Bachmann's Minnesota voter support wilted in the northern and western Minneapolis exurbs 6th Congressional District, which she'd first been elected to represent in 2006. Wealthy Democratic local businessman Jim Graves jumped in the 2014 race after her 2012 bid for the Republican nomination flamed out. Democrats were high on his chances - until Bachmann, facing political reality, quit the race.\n\nThat ended the raison d'être for Graves's candidacy. His support from House Democrats' campaign arm dried up. He was gone by the end of May 2013. Tom Emmer went on to claim the seat, and the nearly 10-year Republican congressman now is the House majority whip.\n\nFrisch looks likely to finish out his race over the next 9 1/2 months. Republican candidates in the 3rd Congressional District include state Rep. Ron Hanks and attorney Jeff Hurd, who had jumped into the nomination fight even before Boebert picked up and left the district.\n\nIncumbent district switchers\n\nBoebert's move is a rare example of an incumbent lawmaker moving clear across the state to run in a different district. Some House incumbents have run elsewhere in their regions when new maps came into being due to redistricting, usually in years starting with \"2\" after once-in-a-decade Census Bureau figures are released.\n\nRep. Pete Sessions (R-TX) did so ahead of the 2002 election cycle. After the 2000 census made the then-5th Congressional District, in suburban Dallas, slightly more Democratic, he moved to the newly created 32nd District. He easily prevailed in that new district, in redder parts of the Dallas area, and has spent most of the rest of the past 20 years as a House member.\n\nThe closest analogy to Boebert's move is Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL), first elected in 2002.\n\nIn February 2010, he jumped to a neighboring South Florida district being vacated by his brother, retiring Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart. Unlike Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart's old 25th Congressional District, the 21st Congressional District had long been considered the Miami area's most Republican seat. No other party even fielded a candidate when filing closed on April 30, 2010, handing Diaz-Balart the seat. He hasn't had a tough race since and now is the most senior member of Florida's congressional delegation.\n\nHouse members with two separate stints in office sometimes represent districts hundreds of miles apart. Take former Rep. Dan Lungren (R-CA), who represented a Long Beach-based district in Southern California from 1979-89. After eight years as attorney general and being the losing 1998 Republican gubernatorial nominee, Lungren made a political comeback in a Sacramento-area House district that's usually a six-hour or so drive from his old home. Lungren said those years in state government, as California's top law enforcement officer, made him a Sacramento-region resident, and he won an open House seat in 2004.\n\nBut like much of California, the district was becoming bluer, and Lungren lost reelection in 2012. Yet he had set an example, followed by a longer period of electoral success from Rep. Tom McClintock (R-CA). Elected to the California State Assembly at age 26 in 1982, representing a then-conservative-leaning swath of territory northwest of Los Angeles, primarily in Ventura County, McClintock became a prominent conservative in California.\n\nMcClintock had a second Assembly stint in the late 1990s and moved up to the state Senate for eight years. In between, he lost a series of races, first for the House, in 1992, followed by statewide bids for controller (twice), lieutenant governor, and in the 2003 California gubernatorial recall election.\n\nBut a new political opportunity arose in 2008, when the incumbent Republican House member in a northeastern California district retired after 18 years. McClintock ran for, and won, the seat, about 300 miles north of the district McClintock represented in the state Senate. Today, McClintock represents the upper Central Valley and Sierra Nevada foothills 5th Congressional District.\n\nFurther up the West Coast, Gov. Jay Inslee (D-WA) once turned electoral defeat into a chance at starting over politically. As a state representative in 1992, Inslee won the then-4th Congressional District, based in the central-eastern part of the state. But he lost reelection in the 1994 \"Republican Revolution\" after a single, two-year term.\n\nSo, Inslee moved west to the Seattle area, nearly 150 miles from his home base in the city of Yakima. Inslee ran a much bluer district and beat a Republican incumbent. Inslee easily held the seat until resigning from the House seven months before the 2012 Washington gubernatorial election. Inslee won easily and is set to retire from the governorship after the 2024 elections."

Lauren Boebert 's (R-CO) move to switch districts in Colorado may be the key to saving her political career.\n\nAfter retaining her congressional seat by mere hundreds of votes two years ago, strategists say Boebert is set to make a political comeback as she recovers from a year of controversy.\n\nWhile the conservative firebrand is well-known for her bombastic rhetoric and fiery support for former President Donald Trump , several embarrassing incidents over the last year did little to help the congresswoman's controversial reputation in her home state. In September 2023, Boebert sparked a media firestorm as videos captured her vaping and disturbing patrons during a date at a Colorado theater. The couple was kicked out of the Beetlejuice production during the embarrassing incident that sparked backlash from Republicans and Democrats alike. The congresswoman later apologized for the incident, saying she had \"messed up.\"\n\n\"Believe it or not, I'm human too,\" she told Jesse Waters during a Fox News interview.\n\nAfter the theater debacle, the congresswoman announced her plans to switch districts. The move from Colorado's 3rd Congressional District to the bright red 4th District on the opposite side of the state boosted her chances of staying in the House. In 2022, Boebert hung on to her seat by just over 500 votes.\n\nSix months after Boebert's big move, strategists say she has the primary race and the general election in the bag. Colorado GOP political consultant Dick Wadham told the Wall Street Journal , \"The math just isn't there for anybody to beat her.\"\n\nHis words come as a new poll shows the incumbent holds a 35-point lead over her nearest competitor. Trump endorsed Boebert in March, despite an incident at a New York gala they both attended earlier this year. The congresswoman came under scrutiny after she was allegedly admonished by Trump's security detail for her drunken behavior during the gala.\n\nTrump still offered her glowing words, touting the congresswoman as a \"Proven Conservative and Effective Leader who delivers for Colorado and our America First agenda.\"\n\n\"Congresswoman Lauren Boebert is a trusted America First Fighter, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement for Colorado's 4th Congressional District,\" Trump proclaimed on Truth Social.\n\nShould she win Tuesday's primary, Boebert will be treading in safe waters this November. According to the Cook Political Report , her district holds a 13-point Republican advantage. Her Republican predecessor won the district by 24 points in the last election.\n\nThe Washington Examiner reached out to the Boebert campaign for comment."

      "text": "Reports of Lauren Boebert's demise were greatly exaggerated\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) won the Republican primary for Colorado's 4th Congressional District on Tuesday night. It was a resounding victory for the GOP firebrand, especially after numerous reports that her reelection was not a sure thing and she faced a tough primary. Ultimately, she received more votes than the next three closest candidates - combined .\n\nBoebert, the representative from Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, will be the Republican nominee for the state's 4th District in November. She will be vying for the seat previously held by former Rep. Ken Buck, who retired earlier this year. She is widely expected to win his seat as the district is regarded as a Republican stronghold. Boebert almost had as many votes in the primary as each of the candidates in the Democratic primary combined.\n\nColorado's Republican voters have made one thing very clear: They really like Boebert.\n\nIn the last three elections, she's earned the majority of their support each time. They could have voted for any other candidate but instead chose her. Perhaps then, it is time that some Republicans realize this and stop trying to sabotage her. Work with her, not against her. It will benefit Republicans everywhere.\n\nAfter all, objectively speaking, Boebert has been a strong, outspoken, and fearless voice for conservative Republican values in Congress. She doesn't shy away from a challenge or a fight. She stands tall on her principles. Objectively, her political platform is everything any conservative or Republican could want from a congresswoman. And, given Republicans' slim majority in the House, Boebert's voice and votes are essential to advancing Republican political agendas.\n\nBecause of her beliefs, her style has been criticized by people on both sides of the political aisle. From Democrats, it's to be expected. Boebert rejects many of the neo-Marxist and radical ideologies that they support. The friendly fire from Republicans, however, is troubling. Inexplicably, some in the GOP prefer their politicians to be docile and not vociferously reject left-wing political attacks. For some reason, they prefer Republicans who smile and nod at left-wing political aggression and attacks. They do not want fighters. They want politicians who keep the status quo and do it in a so-called \"classy\" way.\n\nYet, this is the very behavior of which Republican voters have grown weary. In recent years, they have revolted against the \"old guard\" at the ballot box. They want candidates who will fight for their values. Boebert is confident, strong, and outspoken. She doesn't let Democrats get away with inflammatory attacks on Republicans - she defends her ideals and beliefs. Metaphorically and politically speaking, she is a brawler, and, like it or not, the party needs brawlers.\n\nFor example, contrast Boebert with the politician she is essentially replacing: Buck. At a time when the Biden administration was complicit in allowing a record number of illegal immigrants to enter the country, Buck could have taken action. Instead, he worried more about settling political scores with former Rep. George Santos. As innocent women such as Laken Riley were being murdered, allegedly by illegal immigrants, Buck chose to focus on expelling Santos instead of impeaching Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas . Mayorkas, mind you, was the very Biden administration official who repeatedly lied to people in the country for years with false claims of border security.\n\nConversely, Boebert was one of the pioneers seeking to hold Mayorkas accountable for his dishonesty and incompetence. It's just one of the many examples as to why Boebert has favor with so many Republican voters in Colorado. And, ignoring the noise of critics who, for all intents and purposes, would seemingly prefer their Republican politicians timid and meek, she's been quite effective in advancing GOP platforms. Objectively speaking, the good with Boebert far outweighs any perceived bad.\n\nMany were hoping Boebert would lose her primary. They advanced narratives that her political career was facing impending doom. However, as the saying goes, reports of her demise were greatly exaggerated. Now that she has proved her resilience and grit, it's time to stop trying to sabotage her and start working with her to be successful.\n\nThroughout the country, Republican voters have repeatedly shown for close to a decade now that they are tired of tepid politicians. They do not want a return to the days of electing Republicans who speak softly and, metaphorically, carry a small stick. They want someone with courage, charisma, and boldness.\n\nBoebert has once again proven victorious. Colorado Republicans have spoken - it's time to listen to them."

No text is currently available.\n\n🚨 NEW: Congresswoman Lauren Boebert has filed legislation to abolish the ATF. Do you support this?

      "text": "With 9 Days To Go Before Another Shutdown, Trump Wants GOP To Buy Time \"To Work On Our Agenda\"\n\nWith nine days to go before yet another government shutdown, President Trump has encouraged Republicans to buy time \"to work on our Agenda\" with another Continuing Resolution (CR) -aka kicking the can again.\n\n\"Government funding runs out next week, and Democrats are threatening to shut down the Government - But I am working with the GREAT House Republicans on a Continuing Resolution to fund the Government until September to give us some needed time to work on our Agenda,\" Trump posted on Truth Social , adding that doing so would allow for the administration to \"cut Taxes and Spending in Reconciliation, all while effectively FREEZING Spending this year.\"\n\nTo that end, House Speaker Mike Johnson has proposed a \"clean\" stopgap funding bill that would maintain current federal spending levels through September 30.\n\nThat said, Republicans will have to do this without support for Democrats - which means that it all comes down to whether Johnson can gain the support of all Republicans given the razor-thin Republican majority in the House - before the Senate weighs in.\n\nMost of the House Freedom Caucus, which opposes the temporary funding measures, met with Trump at the White House Wednesday to discuss the funding plan, which could receive a vote as early as next week. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) said following the meeting that they're ready to move forward with the CR, however other caucus members said they would need to see the text first.\n\n\"Look, we haven't seen the final form of the CR,\" said Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD), adding \"In concept, the president has said he needs this for his agenda. We support the president's agenda.\"\n\nMore via Politico :\n\nOne catch: There are a whole lot of House Republicans who have never voted for a CR before, and getting them to play along this time is crucial. Because of the anger over Trump's slashing of the federal bureaucracy, Democrats who usually put those stopgaps over the finish line probably won't be on board this time.\n\nSo it fell to Trump himself to make the sale to the House's fiscal hawks at the White House on Wednesday, and he seemed to make some progress. Missouri Rep. Eric Burlison said he's now open to supporting a CR. And two key Freedom Caucus members - Texas Rep. Chip Roy (Texas) and Chair Andy Harris (Md.)- told reporters other holdouts will eventually get on board.\n\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) may be the fly in the ointment, however, after say he'll \"vote against a clean CR that funds everything in 2025 at 2024 levels,\" because (among other things) - Johnson \"isn't following the provision in law that would have cut everything by 1% if the CR extended past April. 2,\" and that the government \"should not fund the waste, fraud, and abuse that Doge has found.\"\n\nI'll vote against a clean CR that funds everything in 2025 at 2024 levels because: 1. @SpeakerJohnson isn't following the provision in law that would have cut everything by 1% if the CR extended past April. 2. We should not fund the waste, fraud, and abuse that Doge has found....\n\nIn comments to the press, Johnson said on Tuesday that he hopes to release the text of the CR by the end of the week.\n\nIn short, without support from Democrats, House Republicans will need to rally their entire conference in order to approve the stopgap measure.\n\nDuring the last funding fight in December, Johnson pushed for an extension until March so that Republicans could come up with an agreement on new spending bills with Trump in office, before the March 14 deadline.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "DHS Officials Defend Women In Law Enforcement After Trump Assassination Attempt\n\nAuthored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times,\n\nSecretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, alongside other senior officials and agency leaders, have issued a joint statement firmly defending female Secret Service agents during the July 13 assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"In the days following the attempted assassination of former President Trump, some people have made public statements questioning the presence of women in law enforcement, including in the United States Secret Service,\" reads the July 20 statement .\n\n\"These assertions are baseless and insulting.\"\n\nBesides Mr. Mayorkas, the statement was endorsed by 10 other senior Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials, including Kimberly Cheatle, director of the U.S. Secret Service, who will appear Monday on Capitol Hill to answer questions about the assassination attempt.\n\nThe attempted assassination of former President Trump has raised questions about how 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks managed to position himself on a rooftop with a clear line of sight to the former president, whose ear was injured by a bullet.\n\nThe shooting brought the Secret Service director's stated interest in hiring more women into the spotlight.\n\n\"I'm very conscious, as I sit in this chair now, of making sure that we need to attract diverse candidates, ensure that we are developing opportunities for everybody in our workforce, and particularly women,\" Ms. Cheatle told CBS News in an interview last year.\n\nAn array of commentators, including some Republican lawmakers, focused explicitly on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies at the Secret Service, claiming that such programs have undermined its mission.\n\n\"Under Director Cheatle's failed leadership, the United States Secret Service has prioritized woke DEI policies over the core responsibilities of the Secret Service, including protecting our nation's leaders,\" Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) said in a statement, while introducing a bill to hold Ms. Cheatle accountable for allowing the gunman to fire off several shots-including one that grazed former President Trump's ear-before being killed by police snipers.\n\nMs. Boebert's bill would prohibit \"any federal funds from being used to pay the salary or expenses\" of Ms. Cheatle.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Secret Service's chief of communication, Anthony Guglielmi, called out the \"baseless assertions\" that agents are unqualified.\n\n\"As an elite law enforcement agency, all of our agents and officers are highly trained and fully capable of performing our missions,\" Mr. Guglielmi said in a statement provided to some news outlets.\n\n\"It is an insult to the women of our agency to imply that they are unqualified based on gender. Such baseless assertions undermine the professionalism, dedication and expertise of our workforce.\"\n\nThe Saturday statement from Mr. Mayorkas and other top DHS officials appeared to focus most acutely on the line of criticism against women being on the front lines in the Secret Service.\n\n\"Every single day, in communities big and small across our great country, women are serving in federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, and campus law enforcement,\" the joint statement reads.\n\n\"They are highly trained and skilled professionals, who risk their lives on the front lines for the safety and security of others. They are brave and selfless patriots who deserve our gratitude and respect.\"\n\nMr. Mayorkas and the other officials added that DHS will continue to recruit, retain, and elevate women in our law enforcement ranks and take \"great pride\" in doing so.\n\n\"Our Department will be the better for it, and our country more secure,\" the statement said.\n\nFormer President Trump has thanked the agents who were at the rally and praised members of the security team.\n\n\"They did a fantastic job,\" he told the New York Post on Sunday.\n\n\"It's surreal for all of us.\"\n\nThe former president's son, Eric Trump, went further, offering praise for the female agents in particular.\n\n\"I know all those agents on stage and they're the greatest people ever,\" Eric Trump told MSNBC on July 16.\n\n\"The female that's in the picture, she was with me for a very long time and she's one of the greatest human beings you would ever meet.\"\n\nBesides injuring former President Trump, the gunman critically wounded two men and killed one.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "At Least A Dozen Colorado Ballots Stolen And Mailed In, Officials Say\n\nReinforcing concerns that many Americans have with voting that isn't done in-person, at least 12 Colorado mail-in ballots were stolen, filled out with forged signatures, and submitted -- and three of them are going to count anyway. Announced by state officials on Thursday, the thefts all affected voters in western Colorado's Mesa County, but the discovery leaves people wondering how many other forged ballots may have gone undetected elsewhere in the state and across the country.\n\n\"The Department of State learned that at least 12 ballots appear to have been intercepted before reaching voters,\" said Secretary of State Jena Griswold's office in a statement . \"Those ballots were voted and then returned to the Mesa County Clerk and Recorder via USPS mailboxes. This issue was flagged during Colorado's secure signature verification process.\"\n\nRather than sending them upon request, Colorado mails ballots to every registered voter in the state -- that's about 4 million ballots making their way through the postal system and before being left in mailboxes, a great many of which are unsecured. In addition to returning ballots via the postal service, Coloradans can also use drop boxes .\n\nSeveral of the victimized voters were surprised to receive notifications that their ballots -- which they hadn't submitted -- required curing because their signatures didn't match digital signatures in the state database. Griswold said the handwriting on multiple ballots seemed to indicate the same individual completed each of them.\n\nWhile sharing some details about the theft, Griswold, a Democrat, was tight-lipped about the detail most people want to know: which candidate(s) were meant to benefit from this crime? If her name sounds familiar, it's because Griswold attempted to exclude Donald Trump from Colorado's 2024 ballots on the claim he'd incited an insurrection in 2021. In May, the US Supreme Court ruled against her.\n\nDonald Trump must be held accountable for his actions. He incited an insurrection and tried to steal an election from the American people. I hope #SCOTUS affirms the Colorado Supreme Court's decision to bar him from the ballot. pic.twitter.com/LFfRPNNh51\n\nPerhaps the most troubling detail about the Mesa County situation is that three of the fraudulent ballots will not be removed from the count . They were flagged for review, but then a single election judge approved them all. After that action, there's no mechanism for remedy or removal, officials say. The judge who approved the three forged ballots has been reassigned. \"Everybody affected will be offered a new ballot,\" Griswold told reporters.\n\n\"Colorado's elections are safe and secure. This attempt at fraud was found and investigated quickly because of all the trailblazing processes and tools Colorado has in place like signature verification, ballot tracking, and the curing process,\" said Griswold. \"Every eligible Colorado voter will be able to make their voice heard this election.\" Griswold's boast seems excessive, given 25% of the known fraudulent ballots are being counted anyway . Uneasy Colorado voters can check the status of their ballots by visiting Go Vote Colorado .\n\nMesa County is in Colorado's expansive 3rd congressional district. It's currently represented by Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, but she's now making a run to represent eastern Colorado's 4th district instead. She only won reelection in 2022 by about 500 votes and would have faced long odds against the same better-funded opponent, Adam Frisch . The Economist projects Boebert will win the 4th-district in a landslide . Neither of Colorado's Senate seats are up for election this year. Meanwhile, Polymarket gives Kamala Harris a 94.8% chance winning Colorado's 10 electoral votes .\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "A Warning to the Biden-Pelosi-AOC Woke: What Boebert's and MTG's Disruptive Behavior at SOTU Portends Rule by incivility, live to regret it.\n\nA t last week's State of the Union address (SOTU), Representatives Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene (MTG) disrupted. At one point, Joe Biden made a reference to potentially carcinogenic burn pits in military zones, and Boebert yelled that Biden caused 13 military deaths in Afghanistan. At another point, Boebert and MTG chanted \"Build the Wall.\" It is nice they have found each other so they do not become dispirited pariahs in Congress, demoralized by isolation. Like The Squad, they seem to be forming a ladies' clique. Good.\n\nTruth to tell, I have not always been the best behaved either. Without elaborating, during my college years I was quite the pill for those whose left-wing annoyances invited my attention and reaction. However, nigh half a century has ensued. I now have access to some portals of influence, something I lacked then. For example, you read my thoughts on these wonderful pages twice weekly, and I now reach tens of thousands, occasionally hundreds of thousands. In my rabbinic and other professional associations, my leadership roles command respect and attention. In one major rabbinic group, there actually is an entrenched caucus of 1960s Democrats who exist primarily to prevent me from ever becoming that organization's president. Under their by-laws, only a previous regional vice-president can be eligible to run for president. Fearing for the past ten years since I joined that rabbinic association that I would be a shoo-in for West Coast Regional Vice President, they have diluted my electoral support by adding England, France, New Zealand, Australia, Hungary, Poland, Germany, Austria, Vancouver, B.C., Russia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine to the region covered by the United States West Coast. Putin should have it so easy to annex territory without cause.\n\nI miss that Lost America. I hate the coarseness that has replaced it, where a sleaze like a Cardi B can become a success by writing the most disgusting lyrics I ever have seen - and yet can be solicited by a Joe Biden during a presidential campaign to help win young voters.\n\nWhen an organization adds 14 countries to California, Oregon, Washington State, and Arizona just to prevent you from getting elected a regional vice president, you don't need to heckle. Their nonsense validates my influence. And of course I simply proceeded to co-found a more influential national rabbinic organization where I not only am a Senior Rabbinic Fellow but also am ... West Coast regional vice president. And we have not annexed Crimea.\n\nI deeply hope the day will come when the likes of Representatives Boebert and MTG do not perceive it in their interest to further disrupt the halls of Congress during a SOTU. That behavior strikes me as very wrong, almost reflecting weakness. Those without power heckle to be heard. Those with influence get the job done quietly with a big stick. I explain:\n\nWe now live in an era of coarseness, cancel culture, intolerance, a refusal to entertain or even listen to conflicting opinions. That is not the America in which I was reared. When I attended Columbia University, two of my best friends in college were communists. It was college, not the Kremlin. One of them took great notes in all the Karl Marx classes. You could not get a Poli Sci bachelor's degree at Columbia without taking lots of Karl Marx courses. We read Marx, Engels, Frantz Fanon,Herbert Marcuse, and all kinds of related Leftist garbage. Marx , whose father converted the whole family to Christianity before he even was born, was such an anti-Semite that it was like reading Hitler. When possible, I tried to get by solely with Cliff Notes and my communist friend's class notes. It worked. With that blend, my grade for the course was das kapital \"A.\" Today, my college friend probably is a Silicon Valley Democrat fundraiser or, having gotten mugged at some point - whether in the street, on the subway, or in his state income taxes - he might be more Randist-Objectivist than I. We lost touch.\n\nI had another good friend in college, an Arab Muslim who hated Israel. His mid-1970s view was that Israel would be gone in 10-20 years, so why disrupt a good friendship if the Jewish guy ( moi ) was game? And I was game. We simply minimized Mideast discussions, and we went to movies together. We both knew how to pronounce hummus with the guttural \"Ḥ.\" Oh, and Israel is still doing fine, thank you.\n\nI miss that Lost America. I hate the coarseness that has replaced it, where a sleaze like a Cardi B can become a success by writing the most disgusting lyrics I ever have seen - and yet can be solicited by a Joe Biden during a presidential campaign to help win young voters who otherwise (i) would not touch him, (ii) would not know his name, (iii) would not know that presidential elections are coming, and (iv) would miss voting anyway because they would be stoned while polls close.\n\nThere is value in respecting discrete core rules of civility. Not necessarily all of civility, just the core . So we eat with flatware rather than with our hands, even if some of us do not distinguish properly between the fish fork and the salad fork. There is a correct way to hold a fork even if these are the tines that try men's souls. One does not talk nor even whisper when Cavaradossi sings E lucivan le stelle or when Tosca sings Vissi d'arte. Frankly, you don't talk during an opera or a symphonic concert, and should not at any public performance. Nor should you chat in church or synagogue or mosque or temple. Nor eat crunchy munches at other sound-sensitive entertainments.\n\nThere are norms of behavior. And it is wrong - it always is absolutely wrong - to shout out during the president's State of the Union address.\n\nBut here's the thing : It also is unacceptable, and outside all bounds, for a Nancy Pelosi to tear a President's SOTU speech, even after he has finished. And therein lies the warning to the Woke:\n\nDear Wokesters, you do not live in a vacuum. Rather, under a scientific law of physics as applied to politics, know that every despicable action you initiate generates an equal and opposite reaction. Harry Reid suspends the filibuster for presidential executive appointments and the Supreme Court, so Mitch McConnell responsively does what he never otherwise would have done and suspends the filibuster for all other presidential judicial appointments. If Democrats add six seats to the Supreme Court after terminating the filibuster rule completely, Republicans will add eight SCOTUS seats just as easily and even more quickly when their turn comes.\n\nIf Democrats add Puerto Rico and D.C. to the U.S. Senate, the GOP will add one or two red states, too, if it means breaking off Kevin McCarthy's conservative San Joaquin Valley region from California and likewise clipping off the conservative northern region of California or New York or both. Republicans also can consider adding American Samoa as a state. Until now, that American territory, with political status equal to Puerto Rico, has had one elected non-voting delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives. They elected Amata Coleman Radewagen , a Republican, in 2014. She was reelected in 2016 with 75.4 percent of the vote. In 2018 she got 83.3 percent. In 2020 she won 83.5 percent. So she could be a GOP U.S. Senator.\n\nBefore Republicans showed disrespect to a Democrat president at a SOTU address, it was Obama who broke protocols by insulting Supreme Court justices attending a SOTU. That just is not done. Obama did it once and never again because, as of the next SOTU, the attacked justices predictably reciprocally stopped attending Obama SOTU addresses. Trump was treated disrespectfully for four years, so now Biden is treated that way. For all the fun of chanting \"Let's Go, Brandon!\" this did not emerge from a vacuum. That is how it works.\n\nIf Obama had not behaved in manners aimed at humiliating opponents like John McCain, and if Democrats had treated Trump civilly, and if Nancy Pelosi had been proper with Boebert and MTG, they would not have broken protocol at SOTU. Unfortunately, Pelosi has denied MTG committee assignments, banned Republican selections for her January 6 hatchet commission, and regularly flouts civility. Therefore, expect Kevin McCarthy to oust Ilhan Omar from her perch on the House Foreign Affairs Committee when payday comes. As for Rashida Tlaib on Finance and on House Oversight and Reform, we shall see.\n\nThus the warning to the Congressional Woke: Nothing goes unnoticed. You can destroy curricula in inner-city public schools, where Black kids tragically will pay years later for curricula and text books based on critical race studies, 1619 history, woke math, and no cursive writing or graded exams. But laws of physics - like Newton's three laws of motion, his law of universal gravitation, and the laws of thermodynamics - assure that, for every Squad or other Woke outrage, there will be an equal and opposite reaction that will come back to bite. If not for Obama, there would not have been Trump. If not for AOC, there would not be MTG. And if not for Biden and Pelosi, we would not soon see a GOP House and, two years thence, a coherent President.\n\nRead Dov Fischer every Monday and Thursday in The American Spectator and follow him on Twitter at @DovFischerRabbi\n\nTo attend any or all of Rav Fischer's weekly 90-minute live Zoom classes on the Weekly Torah Portion, the Biblical Prophets, the Mishnah, Rambam Mishneh Torah, or Advanced Judaic Texts, send an email to: shulstuff@yioc.org\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "BLM HQ: Should I Stay or Should I Go? The debate over bringing the Bureau of Land Management's headquarters back to D.C.\n\nThe issue is being argued - contentiously - in the halls of Congress, the hallways of the Interior Department, and the West Wing of the White House. The Biden transition team, which met after the election to make recommendations to the new administration, advocated moving the BLM from Grand Junction, Colorado, back to Washington, D.C. Several national environmental organizations have also made that a priority, but they are not unanimous.\n\nOne, calling itself \"The Climate 2021 Project,\" outlined numerous changes it wanted at Interior, including the statement that the new president should \"bring BLM national leadership back to Washington\" on day one. Day one has come and gone, and if anything, that debate is more contentious than before.\n\nThe memo said returning BLM to Washington would \"boost employee morale,\" but, as Rep. Lauren Boebert has suggested, maybe not for the 41 employees who uprooted their families and moved west, many of them excitedly. BLM spent $3 million renovating office space that is markedly nicer than the cramped and dark space they previously shared in a back hallway of the Interior building.\n\nThe transition team recommended moving BLM's headquarters back and rehiring all the senior career staff who took other jobs. But I know from my own experience, as a member of the 2016 transition team, that a new administration frequently ignores recommendations from its own team. The Trump administration implemented few of that transition team's policy recommendations and appointed almost none of their recommended personnel. That's because after inauguration, the political pressures change.\n\nNow, President Biden must consider Democratic Sens. Michael Bennet (D) and John Hickenlooper (D), who want BLM to stay in Grand Junction. The senators explain that \"It simply makes sense that the public servants who manage our public lands should live among the natural resources they oversee.\" They echo regional leaders at the Grand Junction Economic Partnership, the Chamber of Commerce, and influential voices throughout the West.\n\nThey make another vital point, namely that the effort to locate BLM closer to its resource is far from complete. Last year's reorganization plan moved 328 positions out of Washington, but mostly not to Grand Junction. In fact, only 41 were moved to the new \"headquarters,\" and the rest were scattered elsewhere, which employees say created morale problems everywhere. Over 280 employees retired or transferred instead of moving, and nearly 100 positions remain vacant. They should be in Grand Junction. The half-hearted move of just a few was exactly what the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel said it was - a letdown. \"We're stuck between feeling grateful that Grand Junction will be known as the BLM's Western Headquarters and frustrated that such a distinction has been hollowed out to its barest impact,\" the Sentinel correctly wrote.\n\nThe groups demanding BLM's return should not be underestimated, though. One headline shrieked, \"Do public lands in the West belong to Westerners, or all Americans?\" Really? If they move BLM back to D.C, do we get to ask if public lands belong only to Easterners?\n\nA widely circulated article in \"Government Executive\" argued that BLM leaders must be in D.C. in order to communicate with Congress, its parent Interior Department, and the White House. How rich is that, coming from a publication that stopped printing 25 years ago and now only communicates electronically?\n\nThe issue isn't the same for other federal land agencies. The Forest Service manages 154 forests and grasslands, 80 percent of which are in the West - but it has at least some public lands in most states. Similarly, there are national parks and wildlife refuges in nearly every state. But BLM, the largest, manages 247 million acres, all of it in the West. Not virtually all of it - all of it. Well, except seven miles of bike trails in Virginia, three in Maryland, and a lighthouse in Florida. BLM belongs to, and in, the West.\n\nFinally, someone ought to consider the fairness of whipsawing employees back and forth. One president issues an executive order, another repeals it, and the next puts it back - that is not a good way to govern. The movement to make land management agencies more responsive to the communities they impact is just getting started. Biden could reverse it, but instead, he ought to finish it.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit... Read More\n\nIt's been a busy few weeks for Bernie Sanders, traveling...

Deaths in New York City, once an epicenter of the pandemic, have fallen to a seven-day average of three per day, according to the New York Times . In April 2020, by comparison, deaths in New York City were sitting at a stunning seven-day average of 829 per day.\n\nDeaths in California's Los Angeles County currently stand at a seven-day average of nine, as compared to the January 2021 seven-day average of 241 deaths a day.\n\nCounties in several states have also ignored the low death count, implementing county-specific mandates that hearken back to the height of the pandemic. Counties including Sacramento County in California and Broward County in Florida have mask mandates to various degrees, with Broward Mayor Steve Geller saying that he was \"very scared and . . . also very angry.\"\n\nAccording to Geller, \"Ninety nine percent or so of people dying are unvaccinated.\" The New York Times reports that no one has died in Broward County of COVID-19 since June 8, 2021.\n\nThe numbers beg the question: what is the justification for current mandates, given the nebulousness of the identified threat?\n\nRepublicans have widely criticized the new measures implemented in response to the Delta variant. Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado criticized Speaker Nancy Pelosi's mask mandate on the House side of the U.S. Capitol, calling it \"anti-science\": \"she [Pelosi] can kiss my mask.\"\n\nRep. Dan Crenshaw of Texas had a simple message for Americans facing Delta variant-induced mask mandates: \"Don't comply. Businesses. Schools. Restaurants. No one should comply.\"\n\nThe White House seems bent on combating noncompliance, with President Biden announcing requirements for civilian federal workers to disclose their vaccination status. Unvaccinated federal employees will be subject to travel restrictions and regular testing. Outside the White House, Washington D.C. has implemented a mask mandate for all residents over the age of 2, regardless of vaccination status.\n\nHowever, not all states are following along. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has announced his intent to fight any attempts to mandate masks in his state, calling the reimplemented restrictions \"Faucian dystopia.\"\n\nAdditionally, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott recently signed legislation that would prevent any government agencies from requiring masks or vaccines. \"[T]he path forward relies on personal responsibility,\" said Abbott.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger's Vendetta Politics The January 6 Committee is running a Stalinesque show trial against Trump and his supporters.\n\nR ecently, Wyoming \"Republican\" Rep. Liz Cheney published a piece in the Wall Street Journal with this amusing headline:\n\nThe Jan. 6 Committee Won't Be Intimidated\n\nWe are focused on facts, not rhetoric, and will present them no matter what our critics say.\n\nFacts are stubborn things, as President John Adams famously said. He went on: \"Whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence.\"\n\nNo, they can't. But the disingenuous Cheney is giving it the old college try as she pursues her anti-Trump vendetta.\n\nJohn Springs/The American Spectator\n\nAdams' wisdom comes to mind in reading Cheney's Wall Street Journal article and comparing it to what she and her fellow \"Republican\" on the January 6 Committee, Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, have actually said and done on the subject. These stand in sharp contrast to Cheney's claims of a \"just the facts\" investigation in her article.\n\nCheney begins by saying this:\n\nI keep on my desk a copy of the oath my great-great-grandfather signed when he re-enlisted in the Union Army in 1863. Like the oath given by all those who serve in government and every member of our armed forces, Samuel Fletcher Cheney swore to \"support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic.\"\n\nOne suspects Cheney's great-great-grandfather is somewhere shaking his head at what a descendant of his, a sitting member of the United States Congress, has been up to. The true \"facts\" are that she's really \"focused\" on involve aiding and abetting the seizure of the cellphone records of more than one hundred American citizens.\n\nThese records contain data on \"tens of thousands of moms, children, clergy, reporters, and Republican and conservative influencers who were in touch with everyone from White House aides to prominent activists,\" as my colleague Melissa Mackenzie reported in The American Spectator . She points out that \"It is unconstitutional for any congressional body to pursue criminal investigations.\"\n\nShe also notes the ill-disguised real purpose of the January 6 Committee:\n\nThe select committee's stated purpose is to explore better ways to keep the Capitol building secure and create policies that do so. That's not what Nancy Pelosi and her minions are doing. They're conducting a massive data-gathering expedition to create a blacklist of Trump allies, and, if possible, set up criminal charges against them.\"\n\nThat is not only decidedly unconstitutional but also the methodology of a police state and a vivid example of vendetta politics - and Cheney and Kinzinger have eagerly signed on for it.\n\nCheney, incredibly, also says this:\n\nThose who do not wish the truth of Jan. 6 to come out have predictably resorted to attacking the process - claiming it is tainted and political. Our hearings will show this charge to be wrong. We are focused on facts, not rhetoric, and we will present those facts without exaggeration, no matter what criticism we face.\n\nThe January 6 Committee is \"focused on facts\"? Really?\n\nSubscri\n\nHere's a fact: House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy has the authority to appoint the Republican members of the committee. His appointments of Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Jim Banks of Indiana were refused by Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who then usurped McCarthy's authority and appointed Cheney and Kinzinger.\n\nWhy? Because she and her fellow Democrats hate Trump. This tactic is called \"stacking the deck,\" and Pelosi used it to make sure that the committee delivers an anti-Trump verdict.\n\nThis immediately established the committee as a Stalinesque show trial. The committee's investigation is a decidedly un-American proceeding, and Cheney and Kinzinger are active participants.\n\nThe committee is curiously selective in the \"facts\" it decides to pursue. Republican Reps. Lauren Boebert, Andy Biggs, Mo Brooks, Madison Cawthorn, Matt Gaetz, Louie Gohmert, Paul Gosar, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Jody Hice, Jim Jordan, and Scott Perry all have been subpoenaed to \"get the facts.\" But, strangely, Pelosi has not been subpoenaed. Neither has House Administration Committee member and Democrat Rep. Jamie Raskin, who had responsibility, along with Pelosi, for security of the Capitol on January 6, 2021. Cheney is not demanding the facts from either of them.\n\nCheney has presented herself and the January 6 Committee as an impartial group of fact-finders. But by her own frequent admissions, Cheney is not even close to having an impartial view of Donald Trump.\n\nShe has called Trump \"unfit for office,\" \"dangerous,\" a \"threat,\" and someone who \"clearly can never be anywhere near the Oval Office ever again.\" Those are hardly the words of an impartial, fact-finding investigator. Those are the words of a leader in a political lynch mob.\n\nCheney has also offered this biased view on Trump's response to January 6: \"We have a threat America has never seen before. A former president who provoked a violent attack on this Capitol in an effort to steal the election has resumed his aggressive effort to convince Americans that the election was stolen from him.\"\n\nTo say Trump \"provoked a violent attack\" is a flat-out lie. I was not at the Capitol on January 6, but I had a literal front-row seat at the White House rally preceding the events at the Capitol. I personally heard the president urge the crowd to protest \"peacefully and patriotically.\" There was not a word provoking violence. And no one that I saw at the rally - and I have it on video - was urging violence. To the contrary, they were dancing to the rock music blaring from the loudspeakers.\n\nCheney says the fact that Trump told his supporters to \"fight like hell\" is an example of his violent rhetoric. Really? Politicians of all stripes use the word \"fight\" to describe their own political activities. Cheney herself has used the same language repeatedly. For example, in an interview with NBC's Today Show, she said she was \"in a fight to help to restore our party, in a fight to bring our party back to substance and principle and in a fight to make clear that we won't participate in the really dangerous effort that's underway.\" Three times over she borrowed exactly from Trump. She is a walking example of one rule for thee, another for me.\n\nCheney's hypocrisy is incredible. As mentioned above, she is interested in the private communications of all manner of American citizens, but she is curiously completely uninterested in the private communications of Pelosi and Raskin. Where is her demand that they, along with all the members of the committee - including herself and Kinzinger - turn over all their emails, texts, and phone records so that the public can see them? Nowhere.\n\nBill Wilson/The American Spectator\n\nAnd, of course, if you're in the media and you oppose the committee, Cheney will make a point of reading your private emails aloud and into the public record - as she did to Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham. So much for freedom of the press.\n\nCheney goes on in her Wall Street Journal piece to say this of Trump's claims of election fraud, which, she argues, provoked the events at the Capitol:\n\nHe falsely claimed that the election was stolen from him because of widespread fraud. While some degree of fraud occurs in every election, there was no evidence of fraud on a scale that could have changed this one.\n\nBut how would she know how much fraud there was without investigating? As I've written, my own state of Pennsylvania has a long record of serious voter fraud. One need only investigate the Pennsylvania elections of 2016, 2015, 2014, 2012, or 2008, or go back even further to 1994, to find people have been indicted and convicted for running massive voter fraud operations.\n\nIn 1994, a federal judge even overturned a state Senate election because of a \"massive scheme\" (the judge's words) by Democrats to steal the election. But Cheney is completely uninterested in the extensive list of documented facts about fraud in previous Pennsylvania elections, which helps explain why Trump believes that fraud may have influenced the 2020 election, as well.\n\nCheney ends her article with this unbelievable statement:\n\nThose who do not wish the truth of Jan. 6 to come out have predictably resorted to attacking the process - claiming it is tainted and political. Our hearings will show this charge to be wrong. We are focused on facts, not rhetoric, and we will present those facts without exaggeration, no matter what criticism we face. My friend the late Charles Krauthammer once said: \"The lesson of our history is that the task of merely maintaining strong and sturdy the structures of a constitutional order is unending, the continuing and ceaseless work of every generation.\" Every generation of Americans has fulfilled its duty to support and defend the Constitution. That responsibility now falls to us.\n\nSay what? Liz Cheney \"will present those facts without exaggeration\"? The all-too-obvious fact is that the January 6 Committee, with the full cooperation and assent of Cheney and Kinzinger, is nothing more than a vitriolic hit job on Trump and his supporters. They are in no way interested in facts that contradict their anti-Trump narrative. (READ MORE from Jeffrey Lord: The January 6 Committee Indicts Itself )\n\nThe words of President Ronald Reagan about dealing with communists come to mind in looking at the words and actions of Cheney, Kinzinger, and their fellow January 6 Committee members as they go about their anti-Trump vendetta:\n\nThey ... have openly and publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is what will further their cause, meaning they reserve unto themselves the right to commit any crime, to lie, to cheat.\n\nBingo.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "An Agenda for the GOP House Republicans must understand what the people they serve truly care about in order to earn the right to govern in 2024 and beyond.\n\nH opefully, it will prove easier for House Republicans to govern than it has been for them to elect a speaker. There is good reason for such hope because the enemy no longer will be Kevin McCarthy and the Ghosts of Republican Speakers Past but instead Joe Biden, the Ghost of Nancy Pelosi, and the specter of a Diversity-Equity-Inclusionary BIPOC-LGBTQIA+ Kamala-Buttigieg ticket. That should end the GOP divisions and even restore amicable relations between Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nThe Republicans now have a House majority. With power comes arrogance and madness. If they replay past foolishness when the opportunity to govern was theirs, they will pay heavily once again. Thus, no funding for bridges to nowhere. No excesses in pork. No mushy McCain-Bush compromises on border security but, instead, restoring immigration laws as though the United States actually were a real country like Mexico, Tuvalu, Palau, and Nauru. No forgetting that the corruption and perversion of elementary-school education are what motivated many fence-sitters to elect them.\n\nThe Republicans must not use their majority to forget that most of us do not live along the Beltway, do not speak its jargon, and do not care about its internecine squabbles. Rather, we care about eight things:\n\nMost Americans are not politically literate. They are willing to settle for sub-mediocrity. Need proof?  They elected a lifelong liar and cheat, an often doddering and confused gent who needs to be directed offstage by a costumed bunny rabbit , to be president.  When he goes anywhere, he presumably turns to Dr. Jill Biden and asks, \"Eh, what's up, Doc ?\" And, for his Numero Duo, they selected The Giggler .\n\nHouse Republicans must begin sending one bill after another to the Senate and to Joe Biden's desk.\n\nMore proof of American political illiteracy? Americans basically reelected all incumbent senators and governors in the midterms despite whining for two years about how badly America is on the wrong track. This is instructive, more so than analyses about Trump or abortion. People who vote as Americans did this past November did not manifest a change toward the left or right but toward their own continued political illiteracy: \"We are miserable and seasick, so let's continue, straight on course, aiming for that iceberg!\" They elected a John Fetterman in Pennsylvania, knowing fully what he is and is not . And they elected a George Santos ( assuming that is his real name ) in New York not knowing fully what he is not or is.\n\nThe Republican House must understand that these are the people whom they represent and serve. And whose votes they will need again in two years.\n\nThus, voters do not care about the national debt. Thirty trillion, forty trillion, a trillion trillion. Talk to the hand. The debt does not impact average American voters in a way they can grasp because it has to do with numbers and commas and stuff. This willful ignorance has been true for decades. But they do care very much about knowing with certainty that their Social Security and Medicare will not be touched. A smart GOP will understand this, despite classical conservative fiscal principles. Make it clear that those two programs are sacred to Republicans, too.\n\nAmericans do not grasp the ramifications of China increasing her military strength and potentially threatening Japan and Taiwan. They have forgotten those murdered in Afghanistan during Biden's botched withdrawal . But they do care very much about canceled Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's vacations because a puny small-town mayor runs a Department of Transportation that is sky-high above his pay grade. Two months' maternal or paternal leave amid a paralyzing supply-lines crisis. Private jets for himself and his husband. Rising to the level of his incompetence: Call it the \"Pete Principle.\"\n\nTo succeed over the next two years, Republicans must aim as follows:\n\nHouse Republicans must begin sending one bill after another to the Senate and to Joe Biden's desk. Of course, Senate Democrats will filibuster them, Biden will veto any that get through, and House Republicans will not have the votes to override. That all is fine. That is perfect . Put Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Jon Tester of Montana, and Sherrod Brown of Ohio on record as often as possible. Arizona will take care of itself.  This practice will educate Americans in the clearest of terms as to where the parties stand and how they differ on the issues of the day. Republicans not only will honor their promises to the public and advance their declared agenda but also will earn the right to govern in 2024 and beyond.\n\nWhoever their speaker is.\n\nSeven New Year's Resolutions for the GOP in 2023\n\nThe GOP's Moronic House Speakership Fight\n\nReports of GOP Rebels' Insanity Are Greatly Exaggerated\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

Lauren Boebert (R-CO) over comments she made about Rep. Al Green (D-TX) after he disrupted President Donald Trump's address before a joint session of Congress.\n\nIn a post on X, Jake Sherman, the founder of Punchbowl News revealed that Houlahan had filed a resolution to censure Boebert over remarks she made during an interview on Real America's Voice News. During the interview, Boebert stated that it was \"absolutely abhorrent\" of Green \"to go and shake his pimp cane at President Trump\" during Trump's speech.\n\nAccording to Sherman, the text of Houlahan's resolution says:\n\nWhereas on March 7, 2025, during an interview with Real America's Voice News, Representative Lauren Boebert of Colorado said \"For him to go and shake his pimp cane\" about another Member, Representative from Texas, Mr. Al Green;\n\nWhereas the words of the Representative from Colorado are disparaging, derogatory, and racist toward another colleague, and are a breach of proper conduct and decorum of the U.S. House of Representatives\n\nResolved, That -\n\n(1) Representative Lauren Boebert be censured;\n\n(2) Representative Lauren Boebert forthwith present herself in the well of the House of Representatives for the pronouncement of censure; and\n\n(3) Representative Lauren Boebert be censured with the public reading of this resolution by the Speaker.\n\nBoebert's comments come after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) warned an unruly mob of Democrats that they should \"uphold and maintain decorum in the House\" and directed them to \"cease any further disruptions.\"\n\n\"Members are engaging in willful and continuing breach of decorum, and the chair is prepared to direct the Sergeant at Arms to restore order to the joint session,\" Johnson warned when Democrats continued their disruptive behavior.\n\nAfter asking Green several times to take his seat, Johnson went on to direct \"the Sergeant at Arms to restore order\" and called for Green to be removed from the chamber.\n\n\"Finding that members continue to engage in willful and concerted disruption of proper decorum, the Chair now directs the Sergeant at Arms to restore order,\" Johnson stated.\n\nOn March 6, the House voted 224-198-2 to censure Green for his behavior during Trump's address before Congress. As Breitbart News's Sean Moran reported , \"Green stood up, waved his cane, and yelled\" at Trump after the president claimed that he \"had a 'mandate' from the American people.\"\n\nHoulahan was one of ten Democrats who joined with Republicans to censure Green over his behavior, explaining to the Philadelphia Inquirer that she voted to censure Green because she believes lawmakers \"need to recognize\" that there are \"rules in the House of Representatives\" and that there are \"standards of decorum\" everyone has agreed to.\n\nThe Democrat congresswoman from Pennsylvania added that after the vote, she pulled Johnson \"to the side and had a very, very strong conversation\" in which she explained that she had voted to censure Green but that she is \"not OK with arbitrary and capricious applications of the same rule.\" Houlahan noted instances in which Republican lawmakers had not been censured or sanctioned over their disruptive behavior.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

Lauren Boebert (R-CO) on Wednesday revealed she will now run for reelection in the Centennial State's fourth district as she blames \"dark money\" for trying to steal her seat.\n\n\"Personally, this announcement is a fresh start following a difficult year for me and my family. I will not allow dark money that is directed at destroying me to steal this seat. It's not fair to the 3rd District and the conservatives there who have fought so hard for our victories, of which I'm incredibly grateful,\" Boebert said in a video announcing her decision.\n\nBoebert now hopes to succeed the retiring Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO).\n\nThe conservative Coloradan has faced a competitive race against Democrat Adam Frisch, a former Aspen City Council member.\n\nDuring the 2022 congressional midterms, Boebert beat Frisch by only 546 votes in the GOP-leaning district.\n\nColorado Republican Party Chairman Dave Williams believes that Boebert running for the fourth district may jeopardize Republicans' ability to hold the third district.\n\n\"She is clearly concerned about losing to Jeff Hurd or Adam Frisch and is doing whatever she can to keep her seat in Congress - while jeopardizing our ability to retain Congressional District 3,\" he remarked , \"as well as our slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. There were many Republicans counting on her in CD3, and they were let down today.\"\n\nThe fourth district is considerably more conservative than the third district, as the Denver Post outlined :\n\nThe 4th District, which covers most of the state's Eastern Plains, from the Wyoming border to the Oklahoma panhandle, is being vacated by Buck, who has held the mostly rural district since 2015. Several Republicans have already announced their intention to run in that district , where recently redrawn boundaries have taken in suburban Douglas County, south of Denver.\n\nThe 4th District is considerably more conservative than the 3rd, according to active voter registration lists filed with the Colorado Secretary of State's Office. While Republicans outnumber Democrats in Boebert's current district by around 34,000 voters, that gap is closer to 100,000 voters in Buck's district.\n\nDave Wasserman, an elections analyst for the Cook Political Report, said on Wednesday that Boebert running for the fourth district may help Republicans win the third district.\n\nWasserman said Boebert's decision was positive for \"Republicans' chances of holding onto (the 3rd District), as Boebert was the main reason it was in so much jeopardy.\" He now rates the race for the third district as \"leans Republican.\"\n\nBoebert made headlines in September when she was kicked out of a Beetlejuice musical for causing a \"disturbance:\"\n\nBoebert made headlines over the summer after she was caught on camera groping a date, vaping and taking selfies at a performance of the musical Beetlejuice in Denver, and then giving ushers the finger when she was asked to leave and declaring: 'Do you know who I am?' She also sparked controversy by heckling Joe Biden in his 2022 State of the Union address, and caused anger by making an Islamophobic joke about Ilhan Omar of Minnesota .\n\nWatch: Lauren Boebert Escorted Out of Theatre After Causing \"Disturbance\"\n\nFrisch has received the support of many A-list celebrities, including Ryan Reynolds and Barbara Streisand, the Daily Mail noted:\n\nRyan Reynolds and Barbra Streisand are among stars who were trying to unseat her by donating to her Democrat rival's campaign.\n\nThe A-Listers have been joined by Eagles founder Don Henley, actor and director Rob Reiner, as well as Johnny Cash's daughter Rosanne Cash in donating to Adam Frisch's 2023 campaign.\n\nThe Colorado congresswoman said the fourth district \"is hungry for an unapologetic defender of freedom with a proven track record of standing strong for conservative principles.\"\n\nSean Moran is a policy reporter for Breitbart News.

The establishment concocted a swampy backroom deal to try to rig an election I'm winning by 25 points,\" Boebert said in a statement shared with Breitbart News:\n\nForcing an unnecessary special election on the same day as the primary election will confuse voters, result in a lameduck Congressman on day one, and leave the Fourth District with no representation for more than three months. The Fourth District deserves better.\n\nAfter Buck revealed he would not seek reelection in November, Boebert announced she would run for reelection in Buck's district, blaming Democrat \"dark money\" for trying to unseat her in the Third Congressional District, which she currently represents.\n\nRep. Ken Buck (R-CO) (Greg Nash-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nBuck's expedited departure forces the special election, and to run in that race, Boebert would need to resign her seat in the Third Congressional District, which would dwindle the Republican Party's majority further - something she declared she would not do:\n\nI will not further imperil the already very slim House Republican majority by resigning my current seat and will continue to deliver on my constituents' priorities while also working hard to earn the votes of the people of Colorado's Fourth District who have made clear they are hungry for a real conservative.\n\n\"I am the only Trump-endorsed, America First candidate in this race and will win the Fourth District's primary election on June 25 and general election on November 5,\" she concluded.\n\nGov. Jared Polis (D-CO) announced the special election date hours after Buck revealed he would be resigning from his seat by the end of \"next week.\"\n\nBuck told host Dana Bash on CNN's News Central on Tuesday that his departure is so he can \"get in the mix this election cycle,\" as Breitbart News noted:\n\nBuck said, \"Well, everywhere I go in Colorado, Dana, I hear that people are not happy with Trump and are not happy with Biden. I think we need to change our electoral laws here, and I have a passion for that. I'm going to leave, and I'm going to find the right organization to join. I'm going to start working on that issue. We have to have better candidates up and down the ballot, not just president, but Senate, House, local offices. We've got to find better ways to elect candidates and bring America together.\"\n\nBash said, \"You already had announced that you were going to not run for reelection so why leave now and leave a vacancy in an already very narrow majority for your party?\"\n\nBuck said, \"Yeah, because to me it's important to get in the mix of this election cycle and start talking about the issues that people recognize our such a problem right now.\"\n\nWatch:\n\nAccording to Newsweek, he also alluded to further GOP departures from this Congress.\n\nBreitbart News Capitol Hill Correspondent Bradley Jaye contributed to this report.

Lauren Boebert will soon find out whether abruptly switching congressional districts in Colorado mid-election will help or hinder the Republican Party's control of the House\n\nUS Rep. Lauren Boebert will find out whether switching races worked in ColoradoBy JESSE BEDAYNAssociated Press/Report for AmericaThe Associated PressDENVER\n\nDENVER (AP) - Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert will soon find out whether her political gamble , abruptly switching congressional districts in Colorado mid-election, will cost the GOP or reinforce its position in the U.S. House.\n\nBoebert, a far-right standard-bearer whose following reaches far beyond Colorado, won by only 546 votes in 2022. Facing a rematch against the same, well-funded Democrat in 2024, and suffering a scandal where she was caught on tape vaping and causing a disturbance with a date in a Denver theater, Boebert left the race .\n\nAs an outspoken patron of presidential candidate Donald Trump, Boebert said Democrats were targeting her. Her exodus, she said, would better help Republicans retain the seat.\n\nBoebert then joined the race for Colorado's 4th Congressional District, a more conservative area of the Great Plains, arguing that her voice is still needed in Congress.\n\nThe packed and dramatic Republican primary was the biggest hurdle. Boebert maneuvered around a major political threat , weathered accusations of carpetbagging and tended the bruise of getting booted from the Denver theater. With a near household name and an endorsement from Trump, she pulled through the Republican field.\n\nBoebert is now expected to win against Democrat Trisha Calvarese in the district that supported Trump by nearly 20 percentage points in 2020.\n\nSome questions, however, remain as to whether Boebert's withdrawal from her old district was enough for Republicans to hold onto the seat. The Democratic candidate, Adam Frisch, had already pulled in an astounding number of donations for a non-incumbent before Boebert departed, fundraising off of his near success in beating her in 2022.\n\nThe thrust of Frisch's campaign was to \"stop the circus,\" dubbing Boebert's style \"angertainment.\" Without the congresswoman as political foil, Frisch has fallen back onto his politically moderate platform, emphasizing that he will be a voice for rural constituents and take a bipartisan approach to policy.\n\nFrisch, a former Aspen councilman and currency trader, still has one of the largest House campaign chests in the country. It far overshadows GOP candidate Jeff Hurd's coffers.\n\nIt's unclear how much that will make a difference. The district still leans red, and Hurd, an attorney, is a more temperate conservative than his predecessor, with fewer gaffs. Hurd has said his goal is to make local headlines instead of national ones. The baggage free \"R\" next to his name on the ballot might be all that's needed.\n\nWith an expected victory in her new district, Boebert will be filling a seat vacated by former Rep. Ken Buck. The congressman resigned, citing a flank of the Republican Party's hardheaded politics and unwavering devotion to Trump - the traits that made Boebert a name brand.\n\nIn a recording of Buck at a private event initially reported by Politico , the former congressman said \"she makes George Santos look like a saint.\" Santos was expelled from Congress last year. To some, Buck's replacement is another sign of a Republican Party increasingly falling behind Trump.\n\nBoebert has portrayed her intractable politics - stonewalling the vote to elect Rep. Kevin McCarthy as House speaker for a series of concessions - as promises kept on the campaign trail.\n\nBoebert embodies the conservative, rural family values that Colorado ought to embrace more, supporter Jody Gilloth said at an election watch party for the candidate.\n\nShe shrugged off criticism of Boebert for the theater disturbance.\n\n\"She's human, she's not perfect, and neither am I,\" Gilloth said.\n\n___\n\nBedayn is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Lauren Boebert (R) has introduced legislation to abolish the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF).\n\nThe bill is H.R. 129 and it comes at a point when Republicans are just weeks away from holding the House, Senate and White House.\n\nNewsweek noted Boebert's push to do away with the agency is the latest in line of Republican pushes to see the agency undone.\n\nFor example, in November 2024, Rep. Eric Burlison (R) called for the agency to be abolished as well.\n\nOn November 25, 2024, Breitbart News reported that Burlison told FOX News the ATF is \"a disaster.\"\n\nHe said, \"For several decades they've been a disaster agency [which has] been violating the Second Amendment.\"\n\nThe ATF issued numerous rules during the Biden/Harris administration, one of which criminalized owners of legally purchased AR-pistol stabilizer braces. Another one of the ATF's rules declared that 80 percent complete firearm frames are firearms and therefore can only be acquired via background checks. Yet another ATF rule circumvented Congress via new regulations against private gun sales.\n\nOn January 2, 2024, Breitbart News pointed out that Biden's ATF director, Steven Dettelbach, tendered his resignation effective January 18, 2025, two days before Trump retakes the White House.\n\nCitizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms chairman Alan Gottlieb cheered the resignation, saying, \"That's one less person Trump will have to fire after he takes office, and it is one less gun prohibition lobbyist on the government payroll.\"\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins , a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: GOP Reps Introduce Bill To Remove Predator From Endangered List As Attacks Increase, Population Balloons\n\n(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\nTwo Republican house members introduced bill Friday that would take grey wolves off the endangered species list, citing a significant population rebound that puts livestock, pets and humans alike in danger.\n\nRepublican Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert and Republican Wisconsin Rep. Tom Tiffany introduced the Pet and Livestock Protection Act, which would direct the secretary of the interior to reinstate a 2020 final rule that removed the predator from the list in the lower 48 states, sending population management back to the state governments. At the time of the original rule's implementation in 2020, the grey wolf population was over 6,000, which exceeded recovery goals, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services.\n\nHowever, the rule was struck down in 44 of the lower 48 states in 2022 by a federal judge in California. The new law would be immune to judicial review, preventing \"activist\" judges from preventing the implementation of the law, according to a press release. (RELATED: 'Ballot Box Biology': Hunters Slam Blue State Bill As Fundamental Attack On Their Way Of Life)\n\nU.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) arrives for a hearing with Administrator of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Deanne Criswell at the Rayburn House Office Building on November 19, 2024 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\n\n\"Scientific data, coupled with the rise in wolf attacks in Wisconsin, confirms that the gray wolf population has exceeded recovery goals,\" Tiffany said in the press release. \"Yet, activist judges continue to disregard these facts, leaving livestock, pets, wildlife, and communities vulnerable to further harm. The Pet and Livestock Protection Act will restore management to those who understand local needs best - state wildlife officials - and ensure that out-of-state judges can no longer dictate how Wisconsin manages its wolf population.\"\n\nMoreover, wolf attacks on livestock increased in Wisconsin for the third consecutive year, according to Department of Natural Resources data. The bill has 30 co-sponsors and has backing from various hunter and gun advocacy organizations, including the National Rifle Association, the National Shooting Sports Foundation and Safari Club International, according to the press release.\n\n\"Gray wolves are threatening the livelihoods of our ranchers and farmers with attacks on livestock because our agriculture community has their hands tied by out-of-date policies and progressive legal activism,\" Boebert said in the press release. \"This bill enacts a common-sense solution shared by administrations of both parties and prioritizes the strength of our agriculture community over predators.\"\n\nColorado began reintroducing wolves into the wild in 2023 after voters passed a ballot initiative in 2020 by a narrow margin. With the increased wolf population came increased reports of attacks on livestock, according to the Colorado Sun.\n\nRanchers in the state have been hiring \"range riders\" to protect livestock amid increased predation from the exploding wolf population, the Coloradoan reported earlier this week..\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Lauren Boebert And Ex-Husband Under 'Active Investigation': Police\n\n(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\nPolice have launched an \"active investigation\" into an alleged altercation Saturday night between Republican Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert and her ex-husband in a Colorado restaurant, according to the Denver Post.\n\nThe congresswoman allegedly struck Jayson Boebert, her ex-husband, twice at the Miner's Claim in Silt, according to the outlet. This claim has been denied by the congresswoman.\n\nBreaking and sad news out of Silt, CO. @laurenboebert punched her ex-husband Jayson in the nose 2 times and then continued to beat him up. Then she called the cops on him. As much as I despise her, it's just sad for the boys. Jayson has a witness. More to come.\n\n- American Muckrakers (@AmericanMuck) January 7, 2024\n\nAn investigation by the Silt Police Department is ongoing, Chief Mike Kite confirmed, according to the outlet. Police reportedly arrived at the scene after the incident, after which neither party was arrested.\n\n\"This is a sad situation for all that keeps escalating and another reason I'm moving,\" Boebert said in a statement from her campaign manager to the outlet. \"I didn't punch Jason in the face and no one was arrested.\"\n\nThe Colorado Republican's ex-husband told police Sunday he and Lauren Boebert were having heated talks, the outlet reported. He reportedly does not plan to press charges.\n\n\"I don't want nothing to happen,\" Jayson Boebert told the outlet in a brief phone interview. \"Her and I were working through a difficult conversation.\"\n\nJayson Boebert blamed himself for the Colorado couple's \" devastating divorce \" in September, claiming it is \"far from the truth\" that Lauren Boebert left him \"over fame and a new lifestyle.\"\n\nThe congresswoman announced she will be running for her state's 4th congressional district instead of the 3rd district, where she would have faced a tough election bid in 2024. (RELATED: Marjorie Taylor Greene Rails On Three Of Her Fellow Republicans)\n\nThe congresswoman has not shied away from dating since her divorce. She was kicked out of a performance of \"Beetlejuice: The Musical\" in September for \"causing a disturbance\" by allegedly vaping, singing loudly and recording the performance on her phone.

Lauren Boebert (R-CO) underwent surgery Tuesday morning after she was admitted to a Colorado hospital and doctors found she had an acute blood clot, her campaign said.\n\nBoebert, 37, was admitted to UCHealth Medical Center of the Rockies in Loveland, Colorado, after she experienced swelling in her leg, according to a statement released on Tuesday by her campaign. Upon undergoing a CT scan, doctors found that Boebert had an acute blood clot and diagnosed her with May-Thurner Syndrome, a rare condition that affects a vein in a person's pelvis. Doctors completed a successful surgery on Boebert Tuesday morning, removing the blood clot and inserting a stent.\n\n\"We successfully performed surgery on the Congresswoman this morning and expect her to make a full recovery,\" said Dr. Rebecca Bade. \"Patients with May-Thurner Syndrome who undergo the procedure to restore blood flow are able to live and work just as they have in the past after a brief recovery.\"\n\nThe statement from Boebert's campaign added that May-Thurner Syndrome is more likely to affect women between the ages of 20-45 who have given birth. The Republican congresswoman thanked doctors at UCHealth and said she looks forward to returning to her work in Congress.\n\n\"I want to thank Dr. Rebecca Bade and the entire team at UCHealth Medical Center of the Rockies for their great care and providing helpful insight on my recent diagnosis,\" Boebert said. \"I'm looking forward to making a full recovery and getting back to Congress to continue fighting for Colorado.\"\n\nBoebert is currently in a heated GOP primary as she seeks to win the House seat for Colorado's 4th district. Boebert announced late last year that she would switch districts and run for the seat of Republican Rep. Ken Buck, who retired earlier this year. A special election to replace Buck for the remainder of his term will be held on June 25, coinciding with the Republican primary election.\n\nBoebert is not running to replace Buck immediately since she will serve out the remainder of her second term representing the 3rd district, but she is a candidate in the primary election, where she faces 10 other Republican candidates vying to be on the ballot for the 4th district in November.\n\nThe firebrand congresswoman, who has represented Colorado's 3rd district since 2021, won against Democrat Adam Frisch by just 546 votes in the 2022 election, and Frisch is seeking the 3rd district seat again this year.\n\n\"I cannot put into words how grateful I am for everyone who has steadfastly stood alongside me over the past year and beyond,\" she said in December. \"I am going to do everything in my power to represent the 3rd District well for the remainder of this term as I work to earn the trust of grassroots conservative voters in the 4th District to represent them in 2025.\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Trump Ally Lauren Boebert Easily Wins GOP Primary After Switching Districts\n\nCongresswoman Lauren Boebert (R-CO), a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, cruised to victory in a crowded Republican primary on Tuesday night after switching districts to run for the seat of retired GOP Rep. Ken Buck, a Trump critic.\n\nBoebert dominated a field of six Republican candidates in Colorado's 4th district, taking 43% of the vote with the next highest vote-getter, former state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg, only receiving 14%. The 4th District seat was previously held by Rep. Buck, who became a target of Trump's criticism after the congressman opposed the former president's claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Buck retired from Congress in March, a development that Trump called \"a great thing for the Republican Party.\"\n\nTrump celebrated Boebert's primary win in a Truth Social post on Tuesday night, which noted that Bobert was endorsed by the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.\n\nThe controversial Republican congresswoman survived a scandal after she was kicked out of a theater last year when people complained that she and her boyfriend were allegedly \"vaping, singing, [and] causing a disturbance.\" She also faced accusations of \"carpetbagging\" when she announced her run for Colorado's 4th Congressional District while serving in the state's 3rd District, a seat she has held since 2021.\n\nBoebert appeared on stage at her victory party wearing a white \"Make America Great Again\" hat and a pair of Trump's gold sneakers, the Associated Press reported .\n\n\"A lot of folks criticize my approach on things, but I learned very early on in Washington, D.C., that nothing happens without force,\" she said.\n\nThe past six months have been a rollercoaster of headlines for Boebert. In January, Boebert's ex-husband was arrested on charges that included alleged assault of the couple's son, and weeks later, Boebert's son, Tyler, was arrested on numerous felony and misdemeanor charges. Then in April, the congresswoman announced that she had been diagnosed with May-Thurner Syndrome, a rare condition that affects a vein in a person's pelvis.\n\n\"We successfully performed surgery on the Congresswoman this morning and expect her to make a full recovery,\" Dr. Rebecca Bade said on April 2. \"Patients with May-Thurner Syndrome who undergo the procedure to restore blood flow are able to live and work just as they have in the past after a brief recovery.\"\n\nBoebert won a tight election against Democratic candidate Adam Frisch in 2022, surpassing Frisch by just 546 votes. Colorado's 4th Congressional District is more reliably Republican than the 3rd District, giving Boebert a strong advantage in November against Democrat Trisha Calvarese, who won her party's nomination on Tuesday night.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) went to war with each other Monday night after Boebert took a shot at Greene during an interview.\n\nBoebert brought up Greene's past anti-Semitic conspiracy theories when asked if she agreed with Greene's support for making House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) the next speaker of the House.\n\n\"Well, you know, I've been aligned with Marjorie and accused of believing a lot of the things that she believes in,\" Boebert said. \"I don't believe in this just like, I don't believe in Russian space lasers, Jewish space lasers, and all of this.\"\n\nWhen asked if she was a hard \"no\" against McCarthy, Boebert said, \"No, I'm just saying we need to actually have an inside conversation and make sure that these promises are there.\"\n\n\"I've supported and donated to Lauren Boebert,\" Greene responded. \"President Trump has supported and donated to Lauren Boebert.

Save America! Defeat the Democrats!\"\n\nThe country is facing extremely difficult times.

Marjorie Taylor Greene🇺🇸 (@RepMTG) December 19, 2022\n\nThe petty squabble between the two comes as McCarthy tries to lock up becoming House Speaker in January.\n\nStanding in his way is a small group who have come out publicly against McCarthy, including Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC), Rep. Bob Good (R-VA), Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-MT), and Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ).\n\nSeveral other Republicans have raised concerns or have not yet committed, including Rep. Scott Perry (R-CA), Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC), Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-GA), Rep.-elect Eli Crane (R-AZ), and Rep.-elect Andy Ogles (R-TN).\n\nOne Republican source on Capitol Hill who spoke with The Daily Wire on Thursday afternoon said that the main reason that the 12 House Republicans were opposing McCarthy was mostly because they wanted attention or they held some sort of a personal grievance that was small compared to the matter at hand.\n\n\"Too many career politicians have used the America First movement as a springboard to 'Me First,'\" said a senior Trump World official. \"This entire effort isn't about policy or principle, it's about a small group of politicians wanting the limelight at the expense of the movement.\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

Lauren Boebert's (R-CO) ex-husband, Jayson Boebert, was arrested on multiple charges this week stemming from two separate incidents.\n\nLaw enforcement officials in Colorado arrested Jayson Boebert on six criminal charges on Tuesday, including third-degree assault, harassment, prohibited use of weapons, obstructing a peace officer, disorderly conduct, trespassing and obstruction of a police officer.\n\nUSA Today reported that the first set of charges stemmed from an incident that unfolded over the weekend at a restaurant in Lauren Boebert's district in which Jayson Boebert called police and alleged that she hit him.\n\nUpon investigation, police announced on Wednesday that there was no evidence that Lauren Boebert attacked her ex-husband.\n\nPolice said that when they arrived on the scene, Lauren Boebert was \"cooperative with law enforcement\" during their initial contact with her while her ex-husband \"was highly intoxicated, yelling at officers, and was uncooperative with the investigation.\"\n\n\"Although he claimed he had been punched in the face, officers observed no marks or injury on Jayson Boebert to corroborate he had actually been assaulted,\" police said in a statement. \"Staff at Miner's Claim restaurant requested Jayson leave the restaurant due to the level of disturbance he was creating. Officers requested Jayson Boebert to leave the restaurant multiple times; however, he was uncooperative and was physically removed from the restaurant by law enforcement personnel.\"\n\nPolice said that he later recanted any claims of domestic violence that he made against his ex-wife. He was charged with third degree criminal trespass and disorderly conduct stemming from the incident.\n\nThe remaining charges that he faces stemmed from a separate incident that unfolded on Tuesday when police received a call from Tyler Boebert, the former couple's oldest son, who \"told a dispatcher that his father had pushed him to the ground, put his hand in his mouth, and thrown his phone across the house,\" Business Insider reported . \"When Jayson heard the 911 call, Tyler also said that his dad had grabbed a rifle but he couldn't give an exact description since 'there was many firearms in the residence and [he] was unable to say what type of rifle it was.' Tyler also said during the call that he suspected his father was under the influence of alcohol.\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "'Get Real': MSNBC's Ruhle Wants To Know Why Lauren Boebert Can't Be More Like Marjorie Taylor Greene\n\nMSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle asked Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) why she couldn't be more like her colleague, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) during a Wednesday evening appearance on \"The 11th Hour.\"\n\nRuhle spoke with Boebert about the ongoing internal battle among Republicans who support Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) in his bid to become the next Speaker of the House and those who do not.\n\nBoebert is among the 20 holdouts who have thus far refused to throw their support behind McCarthy - and she made it clear that she did not intend to change her position unless McCarthy was willing to move on a few key rule changes and other sticking points.\n\nWhile the fight has only been front and center for the last couple of days, Boebert said that there were a number of Republicans who had raised concerns with McCarthy as far back as over the summer - and according to her, he had ignored them. She went on to explain that the California congressman had enjoyed the party's support in part because he had helped to raise millions in pursuit of what was expected to be a \" red wave \" in November's midterm elections.\n\n\"But he failed to deliver that,\" Boebert pointed out. \"And when he realized that he actually needed our votes, that's when he started entertaining some of the proposals that we had to the rules and the way things function here in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nBoebert went on to add that although McCarthy has made some concessions, he has continued to reject some of the proposals that she believes are important. \"We're not quite there yet,\" she said, noting that she and a few others in the \"Never Kevin\" contingent had been ready to meet with McCarthy and work out a deal before the first vote even took place.\n\n\"There were three of us that were in a room and - one of whom worked very hard to make sure that we were able to get people to this place where Kevin could get the gavel on the very first ballot,\" Boebert said, adding, \"And Kevin laughed us out of the room and then lied about the negotiations that were taking place.\"\n\n\"Most Republicans are with him,\" Ruhle pushed back. \"I mean, half the Freedom Caucus is. It wasn't like he came out of nowhere. He got the nomination from Republicans resoundingly in November. Why wouldn't you take the route of, say, Marjorie Taylor Greene, who shares much of your ideology, take the win, get practical, get yourself on a bunch of committees, and actually do something to set policy?\"\n\nBoebert argued that what she and the other holdouts were doing was a move designed to set policy - and Ruhle got progressively more frustrated as the interview continued, arguing that none of the alternative choices could get to the requisite number of votes any faster than McCarthy could.\n\nSaying that the ongoing debate, although it was certainly chaotic, was how the process was actually supposed to work, Boebert asserted, \"I believe our Founding Fathers intended it to be this way.\"\n\n\"Okay, well our Founding Fathers aren't here,\" Ruhle cut in. \"So let's get real, let's get practical. You can say what you believe -\"\n\n\"The Constitution is, though, so that's good,\" Boebert shot back.\n\nYou can watch the full interview here:\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

Ken Buck (R-CO) has opted not to campaign next year for another term .\n\nI wanted to let you, my constituents and supporters, hear directly from me about my plans for the 2024 election cycle and the importance of maintaining a conservative voice for Colorado in Congress as well as keeping our Republican House majority.\n\nI cannot put into words how... pic.twitter.com/YY5PHS1EJs\n\n- Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) December 28, 2023\n\n\"I wanted to let you, my constituents and supporters, hear directly from me about my plans for the 2024 election cycle and the importance of maintaining a conservative voice for Colorado in Congress as well as keeping our Republican House majority,\" Boebert said in a post to X, along with a video announcement.\n\n\"I cannot put into words how grateful I am for everyone who has steadfastly stood alongside me over the past year and beyond,\" she added. \"I am going to do everything in my power to represent the 3rd District well for the remainder of this term as I work to earn the trust of grassroots conservative voters in the 4th District to represent them in 2025.\"\n\nBoebert eked out a victory in a tight race in 2022 against her Democratic rival, Adam Frisch, by 546 votes. Frisch is running again next year and a poll conducted in August on his campaign's behalf showed the Democrat with a 2-point advantage over Boebert. Boebert was also facing a primary challenge from Jeff Hurd in the 3rd district.\n\nIn September, Boebert faced controversy after she got thrown out of a \"Beetlejuice\" musical performance in Denver for disruptive behavior while on a date. Boebert issued an apology for her actions while going through a \"challenging\" time amid a \"public and difficult divorce.\"\n\nOctober brought reports saying Frisch raised about $3.4 million in the third quarter, dwarfing the roughly $854,000 attained by Boebert. President Joe Biden traveled to Boebert's district in November during a visit in which he dubbed the congresswoman one of the leaders of former President Donald Trump's \"extreme MAGA movement\" and criticized Boebert for opposing his agenda.\n\nWhile Boebert jumps to a new district - with a slew of rival candidates already in the race - one prognosticator said the swap improved the odds of the GOP winning the district she is leaving.\n\n\"This is good news for Republicans' chances of holding onto #CO03, as Boebert was the main reason it was in so much jeopardy. Will move from Toss Up to Lean R at\" Cook Political Report, the newsletter's Dave Wasserman said in a post to X .\n\nBoebert said in her announcement video that her decision \"means not allowing Hollywood elites and progressive money groups to buy the 3rd District.\" She added, \"I will not allow dark money that is directed at destroying me personally to steal this seat.\"\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

They were later told that they needed to leave and that if they did not, they were then trespassing and the police would be called.\n\nA spokesperson for Boebert said that she was not vaping during the performance and that \"heavy fog machines and electronic cigarettes were used during the show, so there might have been 'a misunderstanding from someone sitting near her,'\" The Washington Post reported .\n\nSurveillance video from inside the Buell Theater obtained by local media, however, appears to show otherwise.

So I actually kind of love that that story came out because of how I was quoted. So, yeah, I mean, we're talking in the congressional ladies' bathroom . I'm there with Anna Paulina Luna, and, you know, people are upset about what's going on in the Speaker's race,\" Boebert explained, noting that the negotiations had already been going on for a couple of days and there were some who were angry about that.\n\n\"We hadn't received the concessions that we wanted,\" Boebert continued, adding that up until that point, even though people had certainly had their disagreements about the issues, they had been professional and polite to each other when discussing the situation.\n\nGreene, Boebert said, took a different approach: \"And my colleague from Georgia, the gentlewoman from Georgia, came up and started, you know, being kind of nasty about it. And no one else had been nasty about it. Everyone had been very professional.\"\n\nBoebert went on to say that she had seen a very different Congress in those few days, saying that people on both sides of the aisle were having productive conversations and debates.\n\n\"It was the most organized I have seen Congress since I've been there in two years,\" she said. \"Relationships were being built and strengthened on both sides of the aisle. It was incredible. And so when she started going after me, I looked at her and said, 'Don't be ugly.'\"\n\nLoesch pressed a bit then, noting that up until the battle to elect McCarthy Speaker, everyone had believed Boebert and Greene to be friends - but Boebert made it clear that wasn't necessarily the case.\n\n\"I think the media saw two women in Congress, you know, there was there was nothing against her. We travel in the same circles, have the same policy views on a lot of things, not everything, but on many things,\" Boebert replied, adding, \"But yeah I looked at her, said, I don't have time for this. I said, 'Don't be ugly.' And that's something that my granny used to say to me when I was being a brat.\"\n\n\"It's like the most inoffensive thing you could say,\" Loesch said.\n\n\"She said, she said, 'Don't be ugly.'

      "text": "Mockery Of Lauren Boebert Can't Hide The Left's Hatred Of Female Happiness\n\nAs cruel and dishonest as the mockery of Lauren Boebert is, it is even worse that the left uses this incident to peddle a basic lie about human happiness.\n\nWhen a Republican congresswoman was caught groping her date in a Denver theater, the media made sure we knew about it. Within hours, corporate cable channels had wall-to-wall coverage of Lauren Boebert's hanky-panky, including grainy video footage that played on a loop.\n\nWhat followed was a familiar story: when someone on the right falls short of the mark, the media pounces. When someone on the left does the same or worse, that same media remains silent, changes the subject, or - the first two tactics having failed - decries the \"politics of personal destruction.\"\n\nWriting in Salon this week, Amanda Marcotte (one of the founders of the liberal feminist blogosphere) goes beyond mocking Boebert's lack of propriety. Marcotte argues the congresswoman's pro-life convictions and early marriage are directly responsible for her lapse in judgment during the production of \"Beetlejuice: The Musical.\"\n\nMarcotte reminds us of what is widely known: Boebert got pregnant at 16 and chose to keep her baby and marry the father. The couple later divorced. Earlier this year, the congresswoman became a grandmother at 36.\n\nIt's gross watching a 36-year-old member of Congress act like a horny teenager, of course. But also, it's not the biggest surprise. That's another downside the 'just get married' crowd doesn't want to acknowledge: Robbing people of their youth tends to breed a desire to make up for lost time. There's a sexist myth that only men want to sow wild oats, but of course, women also have sexual fantasies. One of the best parts about putting off marriage for a time is that you get to make mistakes and have your adventures in your youth, when the stakes are low. Otherwise, as we see, there's a risk that a 36-year-old grandmother publicly acts out that drunken prom date she didn't get in high school.\n\nA little history lesson, Amanda. First of all, 36-year-old grandmothers are, in fact, quite common throughout history. I'm sure if Marcotte examines her own family tree, she will find that plenty of her ancestors became grandparents while still in their 30s.\n\nTo Marcotte, an ordinary fact that has been consistent throughout human history is scandalous and bizarre. This is, by now, a rhetorical trick familiar to observers of the American left: take what is normal and declare it perverse; take what is perverse and declare it normal.\n\nMarcotte complains that conservatives are \"robbing people of their youth.\" It's a serious charge, but an ahistorical one. The average age of first marriages (the Boeberts notwithstanding) has never been higher. Only within the last few decades have we decided that emotional maturation is somehow a 20- (or 30-!) year project.\n\nUntil very recently, only the sons of the very wealthy could spend their 20s and 30s indulging themselves and dodging responsibility. \"Getting to make mistakes\" and \"have your adventures\" before finally settling into marriage is an innovation, not a tradition.\n\n(One wonderful part of youth is growing up with grandparents young enough to be emotionally and physically present. Encouraging people to delay marriage and childbearing is, in a very real sense, robbing the next generation of something immensely precious: a close and lengthy relationship with still-healthy grandparents.)\n\nMarcotte calls for a culture that allows young men and women to \"sow wild oats.\" She implies that those who are allowed to do so when they are young will feel no compulsion to do so when they get older. Perhaps Amanda believes we are all given a finite supply of oats, and if we can \"sow\" enough of them in our teens and 20s, we'll be able to settle down, having purged ourselves of all of our adventurous impulses. As any student of psychology can tell you, that's not how humans work.\n\nWe learn to do things by practicing them. If we practice impulsivity we become more impulsive, not less. If we practice dishonesty, it becomes easier to lie - not harder. If we get into the habit of living on junk food, we will want more junk food.\n\nAsk an alcoholic: over time, we build up both greater tolerance and greater craving for the very thing that is harming us. It is true that some people can pass through a brief period of recklessness in their youth and then settle down into a life of responsibility and restraint. They are the exceptions, not the rule.\n\nMarcotte, like many on the feminist left, worries about the renewed interest in encouraging marriage. She is aghast that even many in The New York Times dare to suggest that two parents are better than one, slamming venerable lefty Nicholas Kristof as an \"alleged liberal\" for arguing in favor of marriage as an essential component of a healthy society. She laments that this push towards marriage is merely a device to compel women to \"settle\" for unsuitable and feckless men. As a feminist, Marcotte should (presumably) be concerned with women's happiness. The arguments in favor of marriage - and yes, early marriage - are not rooted in a desire to disempower women. Rather, these arguments are based on the proven idea that marriage makes women happier.\n\nThat's not just a talking point for religious conservatives. It's science. As the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year (citing a massive Harvard University study ),\n\nCompared to those who didn't marry, the married women also had lower risk of cardiovascular disease, less depression and loneliness, were happier and more optimistic, and had a greater sense of purpose and hope.\n\nMarcotte might argue that marriage makes better sense for women who have \"sowed their oats.\" She argues that premarital sexual experience is a prerequisite for happiness, or at least, for greater self-control when on a date at the theater.\n\nThe problem is that once again, the evidence is not on her side. Multiple studies show that while sexual history does affect marital happiness, it is those with the highest number of premarital partners who are more likely to divorce. To mix metaphors, the evidence is compelling that wild oats, once sown, come back to haunt the sower.\n\nIt is not \"robbing people of their youth\" to try to prevent heartache. It is not robbing people of their youth to encourage them to marry early and have children.\n\nI don't doubt that Marcotte wants young women to be happy. I do doubt that she is willing to admit that marriage has the greatest likelihood of creating that happiness. I do doubt that she is willing to concede that self-restraint rather than reckless indulgence is more likely to lead to fulfillment. I do doubt that she understands that the encouragement to \"sow your wild oats\" is setting young people up for disillusionment and dissatisfaction.\n\nAt that Denver theater, Boebert had a foolish human moment. She has rightly apologized. That should be the end of it. But because she is a conservative, and because her life and her politics give witness to her pro-life convictions, her apology is insufficient.\n\nRather, she must be shamed over and over again. We must see that surveillance video of her fumblings a hundred times a day. And her ordinary human frailties must somehow be connected to her deepest convictions so her embarrassment becomes an occasion to smear those who share the congresswoman's commitment to the unborn.\n\nAs cruel and dishonest as the mockery of Boebert is, it is even worse that the left uses this incident to peddle a basic lie about human happiness. Someone is indeed robbing people of their youth, but it isn't conservatives doing the robbing. The thieves are those who preach the lie that self-indulgence and experimentation are pathways to fulfillment rather than despair.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

Yet she was mocked by gun-control advocates for daring to exercise her Second Amendment right to self-protection.\n\nDemocrats launched an effort to ban firearms carried by members of Congress in December after Boebert first approached Capitol Police over gun guidelines at new member orientation. About two-dozen Democrats, according to The Hill, sought to strike a 1967 exemption from D.C. gun laws permitting lawmakers to carry. Although the effort ultimately failed, the D.C. chief of police issued a warning to Boebert if the freshman congresswoman, who leapt into the political arena with a brand tied to gun-rights, followed through on her promise to bring her Glock to the Capitol.\n\n\"That Congresswoman will be subjected to the same penalties as anyone else that's caught on the D.C. streets carrying a firearm,\" Washington, D.C. Police Chief Robert Contee III told reporters Monday. Of course, two days later, Boebert's demands for self-protection became validated when Capitol Police were caught completely unprepared to hold back thousands of mob protestors officials had known for weeks were coming as the historic day certifying results in the Electoral College approached.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Boebert Opponent Changed Vote On City Council To Keep An Affair Secret: Report\n\nFormer Aspen Democrat City Councilman Adam Frisch, who is now running for Colorado GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert's House seat, was successfully blackmailed for his vote on a local issue to keep an affair secret, according to a new report.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Aspen businessman Todd Gardner, who ran a taxi service and a storage facility, told the publication he caught Frisch having sex in a storage unit five years ago. One year later, the City of Aspen was considering a partnership with the ride-share company Lyft for a project that threatened to put Gardner's taxis out of business. Gardner reportedly threatened to reveal Frisch's affair if the councilman, who initially supported what was called \"mobility lab,\" did not reverse course to oppose the experimental transportation project.\n\n\"It was absolutely blackmail,\" Gardner admitted to Breitbart News.\n\nI'm a straight shooter. Was it the right thing to do? No, it probably wasn't the right thing to do. Was it a necessary thing to do based on the situation and me fighting for our survival and the fact that the city was trying to totally go above and beyond any purview they had to put me out of business basically? It was my fight for survival. I made a choice, just like Adam made a choice to sleep with the woman in the storage unit. I made a choice to use the information I had for my benefit.\n\nFrisch's campaign did not respond to The Federalist's request for comment.\n\nIn 2018, Aspen was planning to test the new transportation program offering residents and visitors assistance to access electric bikes, scooters, and shuttles. The city's mayor at the time, Steven Skadron, published a quote with the Aspen Chamber Resort Association that made the service sound as if all the arrangements had been made.\n\n\"Transforming the transit experience is one of the City Council's top nine goals and we've been working toward the SHIFT project for two years,\" Skadron said. \"This partnership with Lyft, the country's leading-edge mobility company, will help provide opportunities for Aspen residents, commuters, and visitors that would not have been possible otherwise.\"\n\nGardner then reportedly sent an email to Frisch with footage revealing evidence of the affair. \"He went to survival mode,\" Gardner told Breitbart News. \"Politically, he's pretty savvy. He came out and worked hard lobbying against it. He was very vocal out there lobbying against it and showing up to meetings.\"\n\nGardner says he is no fan of the incumbent congresswoman. \"I don't like her.

Adam has no integrity.\"\n\nBen Stout, a spokesman for Boebert's re-election campaign for a second term called the alleged episode disqualifying. \"Adam Frisch changing his vote as an Aspen city councilman so he could hide an extramarital affair makes it clear Adam Frisch has no business being in public office,\" Stout told Breitbart. \"His wife and children do not deserve to be dragged into his mess. That said, Adam Frisch should absolutely be held accountable for being a corrupt politician.\"\n\nColorado Republican Party Chairwoman Kristi Burton Brown called on Frisch to drop out of the race. \"Any elected official who has made themselves subject to blackmail can't be an effective representative for Colorado families,\" Brown said in a statement. \"While many things within this story are disturbing, it's clear to most that Adam does not have the temperament, the morals, the backbone, or the judgement needed to be a successful elected official.\"\n\nBoebert won her first election as a prominent gun-rights activist to represent Colorado's rural Third Congressional District two years ago by 6 points .\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

Police Chief Robert Contee III warned Republican Congresswoman Lauren Boebert against packing her firearm to Capitol Hill.\n\nWashington, D.C. Police Chief Robert Contee III warned Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert against packing her firearm on Capitol Hill Monday, after the freshman Colorado representative released an ad promising to do just that.\n\nLet me tell you why I WILL carry my Glock to Congress.\n\nGovernment does NOT get to tell me or my constituents how we are allowed to keep our families safe.\n\nI promise to always stand strong for our 2nd Amendment rights. https://t.co/E75tYpdN4B pic.twitter.com/qg7QGenrNo\n\n- Lauren Boebert (@laurenboebert) January 4, 2021\n\n\"That Congresswoman will be subjected to the same penalties as anyone else that's caught on the D.C. streets carrying a firearm,\" Contee told reporters at a press conference when asked about the newly elected lawmaker's plans.\n\nAccording to Politico, lawmakers are exempt from the District's strict prohibition on firearms as along as members keep their weapons unloaded and stored in their own offices. In her three-minute viral video, however, Boebert, whose gun-rights activism served as the catalyst for her political career, pledged to carry her gun outside the four walls of her Longworth office.\n\n\"I will carry my firearm in D.C., and in Congress,\" Boebert said. \"I walk to my office every morning by myself, so as a 5-foot-tall, 100-pound woman, I choose to protect myself legally, because I am my best security.\"\n\nThe D.C. police chief said his office would be reaching out to Boebert regarding her intentions. An office spokesman for the Colorado congresswoman reassured The Federalist Boebert would follow the District's guidelines but did not elaborate further.\n\n\"Congresswoman Boebert is a fierce advocate for the Second Amendment, as such she will comply with all applicable firearm laws and regulations,\" the spokesman said.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, a spokesman said Boebert was not armed during the making of her video, contrary to what the ad's intro implies. The District of Columbia does not recognize out-of-state concealed-carry licenses, and nonresidents such as Boebert must register their firearms with D.C. police.\n\nA group of House Democrats launched an effort in December to ban lawmakers from carrying firearms after Boebert approached Capitol Police over the issue at new-member orientation. About two-dozen Democrats, the Hill reported , sought to overturn the local gun-law exemption for lawmakers provided by a 1967 regulation. The rules package proposed by Democrats, however, includes no such proposal to repeal the exemption.\n\nWhile the Capitol Hill complex is fitted with armed officers protecting each building, security at the Capitol has been compromised before. In 1954, a group of Puerto Rican radicals stormed the House chamber and began shooting in an attack that ultimately injured five members, all of whom survived. Bullet holes can still be seen in the chamber today.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

Ilhan Omar.\n\nThe House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on a bill on Tuesday that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi fast-tracked to appease leftist Rep. Ilhan Omar after she took offense to a stupid joke made by Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert.\n\nAt a recent event, Boebert referred to Omar as being part of the \"Jihad Squad.\"\n\n\"I looked to my left and there she is: Ilhan Omar. And I said, 'Well, she does not have a backpack, we should be okay,'\" Boebert said.\n\nShe later apologized for offending Omar and offered to speak with her about the comments.\n\nI apologize to anyone in the Muslim community I offended with my comment about Rep. Omar. I have reached out to her office to speak with her directly. There are plenty of policy differences to focus on without this unnecessary distraction.\n\n- Rep. Lauren Boebert (@RepBoebert) November 26, 2021\n\nOmar, however, was not satisfied after the pair's later phone call and demanded action against Boebert.\n\n\"I myself have reported hundreds of threats on my life, often triggered by Republican attacks on my faith,\" Omar said.\n\nIf passed, the legislation would create a U.S. State Department office led by a president-appointed envoy focused on documenting and combatting anti-Islamic bigotry worldwide. The broad and vague language employed by the Democrats who drafted the bill, some Republicans say, leaves too much room for concerns and criticisms about true Islamic extremism to be brushed off as \"Islamophobic\" hate speech .\n\nAs ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee Rep. Michael McCaul noted in his dissent to the legislation, attacks against Muslims are real and need to be addressed, but \"the bill does not condemn persecution or gross violations of internationally recognized human rights against Muslims, and Democrats voted down an amendment that would have appropriately focused the new office's efforts of the plight of the Uyghurs and Rohingya, in particular.\" The act simply offers to document it.\n\n\"Instead, H.R. 5665, creates a duplicative office and a new special envoy position in the State Department, which it charges with combating 'Islamophobia and Islamophobic incitement,' two deliberately vague terms that appear nowhere in federal statute and are defined nowhere in the bill,\" he said .\n\n\"Republicans firmly believe that no one should ever be attacked or denied their human rights or dignity because of their religious faith, but this rushed, partisan legislation does not represent a serious legislative effort and is instead a divisive messaging bill that is unlikely to become law,\" a statement from House Republican Whip Steve Scalise and other GOP leaders stated.\n\nDespite Republicans' concerns about the Combating International Islamophobia Act, Pelosi pushed the legislation and allowed it to rush through committee in an effort to quiet Omar's leftist allies in the lower chamber, led by Democrat Rep. Ayanna Pressley, who demanded that the speaker strip Boebert of her committee assignments over the comments.\n\nAfter publicly condemning Boebert but refusing to take action against her, Pelosi instead offered to back Omar and Democrat Rep. Jan Schakowsky's legislation, which was introduced just two months ago, to shut up the progressives in the House. The Biden administration quickly joined in supporting the act.\n\n\"Our country's commitment to defending freedom of religion and belief goes back centuries, and the Administration strongly believes that people of all faiths and backgrounds should be treated with equal dignity and respect around the world,\" the White House said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nWhile the legislation would still have to make it through the Senate and to President Joe Biden's desk before becoming a law, it is expected to pass the House with just Democrat support.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

According to the Colorado Sun, the Trump-endorsed Republican has been arrested several times for minor offenses from dog code violations to domestic disturbances and unsafe driving.\n\n\"While Diane Mitsch Bush and her supporters have decided to take the low road, we are proud that Lauren Boebert is continuing to work hard across CD-03 to talk to voters about results and what she stands for,\" Colorado Republican Party Spokesman Joe Jackson told The Federalist in a statement. \"These negative and misleading attacks won't change the fact that Diane Mitsch Bush is a socialist who supports the Green New Deal and Medicare for All.\"\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Relax, The GOP Fight Over House Speaker Doesn't Really Matter\n\nIt's just a vote about management.\n\nAfter three rounds of voting on Tuesday, Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy failed to secure the 218 needed to become speaker of the House. It was the first time in a century that the vote has gone to multiple ballots. Now, the \"fight spills into a second chaotic day,\" notes ABC News. There's a lot of excitement in Washington.\n\nOf course, somewhere in the vicinity of zero voters will change their worldview or political affiliation because the GOP is taking a few extra days to grind out their leadership vote. Nor is there anything particularly \" dysfunctional \" about disagreeing on the question. McCarthy isn't an admiral or preordained by the Lord to be speaker, so this isn't \" mutiny ,\" it's just a vote. Indeed, a battle over leadership shows a more democratic dynamic than the typical lockstepping on the matter. In most other democratic nations this kind of parliamentary fight would be considered tame and completely expected.\n\nHowever the vote ends up, though, it won't matter much because neither side in this battle has anything special or particularly consequential to offer.\n\n\"This is about saving the country and getting somebody that's going to cut and get us on a financial path of solvency,\" claims McCarthy supporter Ralph Norman. Guess what? Kevin McCarthy isn't Henry Clay. He possesses no extraordinary skill or vision that makes him uniquely qualified to stop the Democrats' next spending bill, much less \"save\" the country. The conceit and sanctimony of politicians who believe the world is in desperate need of their talents is endlessly insufferable. If you want to venerate middling House members, become a Democrat and throw your hosannas at Nancy Pelosi.\n\nRepublicans need competency more than anything else these days. The American people voted to split government power - again. The governing mandate of House Republicans is to check the executive branch. With a slim House majority, and the Senate and presidency in the hands of Democrats, the only requisite skill needed in a speaker is the ability to corral the party's factions to stop the opposition. If you are unable to gain consensus during a partisan vote for leadership, how will you do it during your term?\n\n\"You can't accommodate a small group that essentially has you hostage, and that's what's going on here - we're not going to do it,\" says McCarthy booster Don Bacon. Sure you can. This isn't the papacy. Is there no other conservative in the House with some basic aptitude who can bring together the party? McCarthy can go back to being a plain-old congressman or head for the lobbying job, and the country would remain exactly as he found it. McCarthy is certainly as good as anyone else in Congress. But also, he is only as good as almost anyone else in Congress.\n\nThat said, what is the point? Not much that I can see. Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert have no competing legislative agenda to offer, much less any coherent philosophical positions. McCarthy has gone out of his way to placate the nuts in his party. Why any sane person would want the job of dealing with Paul Gosar or Marjorie Taylor Greene is beyond my comprehension.\n\nOthers among the 20 holding up the coronation probably have some personal gripes against McCarthy - which is a completely legitimate reason to oppose electing him boss, by the way. Others are intent to fight the \"establishment\" for its own sake, which is a vacuous and nonsensical position. Someone is going to be in charge. McCarthy isn't Fred Upton. And if you're constantly opposing that person because you can't do everything you want, you will get nothing. Though this seems to be a state in which many Republicans seem quite content.\n\nIt's true that the two-party system creates stability by building left-right consensus before elections. But this particular fight, though largely senseless, is over the future of management, not about some big ideological schism.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Lauren Boebert does not 'stoke' anti-LGBTQ sentiment-she advocates to protect kids\n\nBeyond the remarkably irresponsible wording which gives the impression Boebert has \"stoked\" anti-LGBTQ violence which led to a mass shooting, the evidence provided is just as absurd.\n\nJumping on their newest bully tactic of frantically accusing anyone who criticizes progressive LGBTQ policies of causing violence to LGBTQ people, LGBTQ Nation decided to escalate the rhetoric to a whole new level. With only a few days passing since the Colorado Club Q shooting, which still has no released motive, though the suspect is reportedly non-binary , the LGBTQ news site declared in a headline, 12 times that Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert stoked anti-LGBTQ violence that led to a mass shooting . Beyond the remarkably irresponsible wording which gives the impression Boebert has \"stoked\" anti-LGBTQ violence which led to a mass shooting, the evidence provided is just as absurd.\n\nEssentially, Boebert is accused of supporting a laundry list of mainstream conservative positions, ranging from opposing transgender medical transition in minors and children to speaking out against teenage girls being pushed out of girls' sports, to advocating against adult-themed sexuality and gender ideology being promoted in children's media.\n\nShe has criticized policies advocated for by Assistant Secretary for Health, Biden's trans diversity hire Adm. Rachel Levine . Boebert asked about a new TSA policy saying, \"By decreasing pat-downs & identity validation measures for transgenders, the TSA is practically inviting terrorists to take advantage of our weak & woke security systems,\" LGBTQ activists have declared any questioning of their agenda is now dangerous .\n\nLGBTQ activists have resorted to accusing proponents of parental rights legislation, efforts to prevent children from being exposed to sexually-explicit drag shows, opposing pornographic materials in schools and exposing teachers and other professionals in charge of children who boast online of imposing sexual and gender ideology onto kids without parental consent of attacking all LGBTQ people.\n\nIn August, the Human Rights Campaign released a hair-on-fire study declaring the term \"groomer\" to be an anti-LGBTQ slur and determined the term had increased in usage on social media by 400 percent. For the record, this is the Human Rights Campaign equating the term \"groomer\" with LGBTQ people, and not, as they believe, pointing out that this is what others do-they don't.\n\nImran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate argued , \"We're in the middle of a growing wave of hate and demonization targeting LGBTQ+ people,\" continuing, \"Online hate and lies reflect and reinforce offline violence and hate. The normalization of anti-LGBTQ+ narratives in digital spaces puts LGBTQ+ people in danger.\"\n\nCalifornia state Senator Scott Wiener, who pushed through policies to allow biological males who identify as trans to be housed in women's prisons, declared , \"The word \"groomer\" is categorically an anti-LGBTQ hate word. It's super homophobic/transphobic. It plays into the slander that LGBTQ people are pedophiles. It's no different than calling someone a fagg*t. If you call someone groomer, you're inciting violence against LGBTQ people.\"\n\nDespite these hysterical warnings of threats against LGBTQ people, there has been no reported evidence to support this assertion. Per FBI analysis , hate crime reporting has remained steady over the last decade and only 0.01 percent of LGBTQ Americans report hate crimes annually. Consistent reviews of murders of transgender people continue to reflect an astonishingly low bias crime rate, with less than 10 incidents in the last decade reasonably categorized as \"hate\" motivated. The Pulse nightclub mass shooting was not, in any way, motivated by anti-LGBTQ hate and was instead found to be Islamic terrorism.\n\nThis targeting of Boebert is particularly egregious considering her immediate response was to send condolences to the victim's families. She tweeted , \"The news out of Colorado Springs is absolutely awful. This morning the victims & their families are in my prayers. This lawless violence needs to end and end quickly.\"\n\nThe left's instinct to immediately attack and accuse political opponents of \"hate\" and malicious motivation after any tragedy has become sadly predictable. Ironically, the left's new favorite accusatory term, \"Stochastic terrorism,\" newly defined by Dictionary.com as, \"the public demonization of a person or group resulting in the incitement of a violent act, which is statistically probable but whose specifics cannot be predicted,\" appears to be their new normal.\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

Lauren Boebert WINS primary election\n\nDespite being a main target of congressional Democrats, Boebert's win pushes her one step closer to serving Colorado's 3rd Congressional District for a second term.\n\nRepresentative Lauren Boebert (R-CO) won the state's primary election on Tuesday, defeating Republican state Senator Don Coram.\n\nDespite being a main target of congressional Democrats, Boebert's win pushes her one step closer to serving Colorado's 3rd Congressional District for a second term.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump gave Rep. Lauren Boebert his endorsement, calling her a \"fearless leader\" shortly after she announced her reelection campaign.\n\n\"Congresswoman Lauren Boebert has done a fantastic job in her first term representing Colorado's Third District,\" Trump said in a statement . \"She is a fearless leader, a defender of the America First Agenda, and a fighter against the Loser RINOs and Radical Democrats. She will continue to be tough on Crime, strong on Borders, and always protect our under-siege Second Amendment. Lauren has my Complete and Total Endorsement for her reelection!\"\n\nThe win comes after a major Democrat PAC attempted to assassinate her character to sway the election results.\n\nThe American Muckrakers PAC, co-founded by former Democratic North Carolina state Senate candidate David Wheeler, published false accusations that Rep. Boebert was a paid escort before resuming office. They also claimed that she met Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) during that time, and that he urged her to run for office.\n\nBoebert called the allegations \"Fake News,\" and later described them to FOX News as \"blatantly false and disgusting.\"\n\nThe American Muckracker PAC has been behind multiple Republican smear campaigns, most notably Madison Cawthorn , whose re-election was successfully derailed via a series of leaked videos.\n\nUnlike Cawthorn, Boebert came out victorious against the smears and joined other Trump-endorsed candidates in victory.\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who said she would call for an investigation into the claims it set forth if Republicans take back the House in the 2022 November midterm elections.\n\nDuring a press conference on Wednesday, Boebert spoke out against the Biden administration's Disinformation Governance Board, and was questioned by a reporter on \"misinformation from the former president\" regarding the 2020 election.\n\nRep.

Lauren Boebert if he believes that HHS should fund services for \" sex reassignment surgery for minors ,\" HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said that he would do \"everything I can\" to ensure that access is available.\n\n\"So for the record,\" Boebert asked, \"you favor HHS funding being able to go for sex reassignment surgeries on minors?\"\n\n\"I will do everything I can to defend any American, including children, whether or not they fit the categories you have mentioned or not, and if they talk about gender affirming care, I am there to protect the rights of any American,\" Becerra said.\n\nBoebert used her time in the House Budget Committee to try to get answers from Becerra, who parroted talking points, and refused to nail down terms such as mother, woman, or what a \"trans child\" is.\n\nWhen Boebert spoke about \"gender affirming care,\" specifically what sex reassignment surgeries entail, Becerra said that he did not consider the removal of healthy breasts in service to looking male, nor castration, hysterectomies, removal of ovaries or testicles, to be mutilation of children.\n\n\"Can you confirm for this committee what is a man?\" Boebert asked Becerra.\n\n\"You're looking at one,\" he said.\n\n\"Can you tell me, can men get pregnant ?\" Boebert asked.\n\nBecerra danced around the question, saying \"the answer is pretty obvious.\"\n\n\"What is the answer, sir?\" Boebert pressed. \"Can men get pregnant?\"\n\n\"I'm not aware of it,\" Becerra said.\n\n\"In materials coming from your department, you've referred to mothers as as birthing persons replacing that title with-\"\n\n\"Are mothers not persons?\" Becerra asked.\n\n\"Mothers are persons but it seems to be more inclusive like you're trying to include another gender in that,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm all about inclusion,\" Becerra said.\n\nBoebert said unequivocally that men do not need to be included under the term mother, and that the term birthing persons is entirely unnecessary when there is a perfectly good word for those who give birth to children: mothers.\n\n\"I want to read for you from a document from your office ,\" Boebert said. \"The Office of Population Affairs. It says in here and I quote, 'gender affirming care encompasses many facets of health care needs and support. It has been shown to increase positive outcomes for transgender and non binary children.' Mr. Secretary, what is a transgender child?\"\n\nBecerra brushed off the question by saying that all children should be loved.\n\n\"Can you define what a 'transgender child' is?\" Boebert pressed.\n\nBecerra said: \"That's a child in America, it's an American citizen child who needs the services and love just the way any other child.\"\n\n\"Do you believe that a child is capable of making life-altering decisions to maim themselves?\" Boebert asked.\n\nBecerra refused to answer the question, saying that he didn't agree with Boebert's premise that the removal of healthy sex organs from children and teens, not the application of off-label drugs to halt the natural process of puberty, or the prescription of cross-sex hormones, was either maiming or mutilation.\n\n\"I don't agree with your premise,\" he said. \"But what I will say to you is children know much about themselves and with the help of-\" Becerra, it seems, trusts children to know whether or not they should become sterilized, neutered humans or not.\n\n\"Do you believe that children are capable of making the decision to self-mutilate?\" Boebert asked.\n\nAgain, Becerra quibbled with her language and used terminology that disguises the truth of what happens, such as \"gender affirming care,\" which can encompass surgeries and drugs that cause sterilization and deformity in service to the idea that a child can truly and spiritually know that they were meant to be the opposite sex.\n\n\"I don't necessarily accept the question,\" Becerra said.\n\n\"You have 'gender affirming care' for young people, so this is something you have looked over-\" Boebert posited.\n\n\"I don't equate 'gender affirming care' with mutilation,\" Becerra said, refusing to discuss the details on the basis that Boebert was using terms he didn't like. \"If that's where you're going, then you're not going to get the answer you want.\"\n\nBoebert wanted to know if HHS had funded mutilating surgeries on minors. Becerra joked that he should defer to his wife on that since she is a gynecologist, but did not answer whether or not the federal government had funded these surgeries on minors.\n\nAgain, Boebert pressed, and Becerra issued generalisms.\n\n\"Americans are entitled to receive health care services, if they are entitled to receive any of the services that you just mentioned. And it would be against a person to try to deny them that care,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked outright if he favored tax payer dollars going to fund the genital mutilation of children, Becerra leaned again into rhetoric, saying that he would defend the rights of children to access health care.\n\nBoebert, however, had documents from HHS showing that Becerra and his cohort at HHS stated that \"gender affirming care is trauma informed care,\" and that this \"care\" is inclusive of \"puberty blockers, hormones and surgeries for minor children.\"\n\n\"You go on to assure assure parents that there is no scientifically sound reason to doubt hormones and surgeries are helpful to minor children. You also discussed this in a document that the potential for removing children from their parents is on the table if they're not providing providing gender affirming care. Mr. Secretary, do you think that parents who believe in two gender only should have their children removed from them?\" Boebert asked.\n\nChairman of the Budget Committee John Yarmuth said Becerra didn't have to answer since Boebert's questioning time was up. But Becerra said he could answer, and then didn't actually answer the question.\n\n\"I believe in supporting and protecting transgender youth. I believe that they, along with their parents and their caregivers, will make the best decisions. And I would really urge that politicians like you stay out of their business.\"\n\nThe Biden administration continues to urge parents to \"affirm\" their children lest their children kill themselves. At no point do they discuss the reality of the medical procedures involved, or the damage done to minor bodies that undergo drastic, cosmetic genital reconstruction or the incredibly detrimental effects of providing drugs to halt puberty, or the injection of cross-sex hormones into children.\n\nThe HHS website offers resources on \"access to community-based providers who have experience providing health services, including medical, counseling, social, and psychological services, and HIV/STI testing for LGBTQI+ youth.\"\n\nHHS also provides information on how \"gender affirming care\" \"improves the mental health and overall well-being of gender diverse youth.\"\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

Boasberg ordered the administration to turn around planes deporting alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador and instead return them to the US The administration refused to comply, and President Trump has called for Boasberg's impeachment .\n\nIn response, Rep.

While many of those members stood, cheering and applauding for the foreign leader, notably Matt Gaetz of Florida and Colorado's Lauren Boebert did not. Mitch McConnell, minority leader in the Senate, recently declared that \"Making sure that the Defense Department can deal with major threats coming from Russia and China, providing assistance for Ukrainians to defeat the Russians- that's the number one priority of the United States Right now, according to most Republicans.\" While establishment Republicans expressed a desire to keep funding the nation's effort to stave off Putin's advances, those in the MAGA wing of the party were vocal in their opposition to the idea of the US funding another forever war , The Hill reported. Many MAGA Republicans, such as Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , chose not to attend the address at all, and said that \"The American taxpayers are literally paying to prop up many countries all over the world in foreign aid, but America is virtually crumbling before our eyes. It's like the American people are raped everyday at the hands of their own elected leaders.\" Showcasing a list of all the aid the US provides to foreign nations, Greene slammed Congress for paying to \"prop up many countries\" while \"America is vitrually crumbling before our eyes.\" Among those who did attend the speech was Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, though he did make a point of not joining the vast majority of Congress members in giving Zelensky a standing ovation, a spectacle he referred to as a \"North Korea-style performance.\" \"I feel no compunction to go out and applaud some foreign leader from a historically corrupt country who is begging for more than the $100 billion that Congress is set to send them,\" he told FOX News' Tucker Carlson.
