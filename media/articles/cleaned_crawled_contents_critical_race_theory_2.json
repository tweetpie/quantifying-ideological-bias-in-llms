      "text": "I'm a scholar of critical race theory - here's the reality about it behind the conservative moral panic\n\nCritical race theory (CRT) is the current conservative media boogeyman spreading moral panic about poor white people being confronted with the history of racism in the United States. Claims about critical race theory range from plausible but incorrect (it's about white privilege and white people's racism) to outlandish and bizarre (it supports a white genocide and confiscating all white people's property). The truth of critical race theory is that it's a socio-legal framework for analyzing the disparate impact of policies on marginalized communities, most often Black people.\n\nOK, but what does that mean? Since CRT was an academic methodology taught in law schools and advanced college courses until recently, those who truly understand CRT often speak in academic language that can be difficult to understand. However, unlike a lot of academic methodologies, CRT has clear and practical real-world applications. Due to its name and origin, people often believe it's an overly theoretical study without concrete evidence. In reality, the scholarship in CRT is often based on the study of statistics, laws and legal cases (about as concrete as you can get).\n\nBerkeley Law Professor Khiara Bridges, a scholar of intersectionality and reproductive rights, provided a list of key tenets of critical race theory in her book Critical Race Theory: A Primer . Professor Bridges argues that critical race theory is concerned with Justice (with a capital J) and is not a thought experiment or academic exercise. Her tenets are that CRT acknowledges that race is a social construction, not a biological reality, that racism is a normal embedded feature of American society (not an aberration), a rejection of traditional liberalism's understandings of racism, and a connection between scholarship and people's real lives. While Professor Bridge's list of core tenets restate a lot of earlier CRT scholarship, it is relevant that her book was published in 2018 and continues to agree with the originators of CRT, such as Derrick Bell and Kimberle Crenshaw. Often, critics of CRT claim the origins are reasonable but the current state is what is problematic. As a newly minted CRT PhD, my scholarship remains loyal to the origins and agrees with Professor Bridge's core tenets.\n\nSo what do those core tenets mean practically? First, race has no scientific basis but is instead a social construction based on arbitrarily differentiating between different groups of people. According to the American Society of Human Genetics, \"The science of genetics demonstrates that humans cannot be divided into biologically distinct subcategories.\" However, while race is social and arbitrary, the effects of racism are very real. Rather than essentializing different groups of people based on race, critical race theory challenges essentializing by examining societal reasons for disparate impacts on different races (don't worry we'll come back to this). To say racism is a normal embedded feature of American society, critical race theory is arguing for systemic, rather than individual, causes of racism. It is not concerned with individual instances of racism but instead with large societal impact.\n\nThe tenet about liberalism is a little more complicated. Critical race theory originated in the 1970s and gained popularity, among academics, in the 1980s. This period was a response to the work of the civil rights movement that ended segregation and resulted in important legislation like the Voting Rights and Civil Rights Acts. After this work, racialized language was removed from law which ended de jure (but not de facto ) segregation. Laws could no longer differentiate based on race, which had been justified until this period as treating both races the same, \"separate but equal.\"\n\nNow laws could not use any explicitly racialized language and instead had to be \"facially neutral.\" CRT scholars came out of a period during which racism was still having a big impact and laws were still discriminatory despite their \"facially neutral\" status. Therefore CRT sought to address the disparate impact of facially neutral laws, which challenged the traditional liberalism notions of \"colorblindness\" and legal \"equality.\" CRT showed the need for \"equity.\" The notion of equality seeks to treat everyone equally. The notion of equity suggests that equal treatment is not sufficient if people do not start out on equal footing with equal opportunities. So when CRT scholars say they are challenging traditional liberalism they are not advocating for bringing down democracy. They are just showing that equal treatment is insufficient.\n\nSo how is CRT connected to real-world examples? It's so connected that the entire concept of intersectionality -that a person's social and political identities can combine to create different types of discrimination-originated as a tool for Kimberle Crenshaw to argue legal cases that dealt with both racial and sex discrimination, so a single issue analysis was insufficient. In her 1989 paper, \"Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex,\" Crenshaw discussed three cases in which Black women faced both race and sex discrimination, not one or the other. Crenshaw argued against judges who thought creating a separate class of Black women for the purposes of discrimination would be unwieldy, wanting to limit causes of action to either race or sex discrimination. Crenshaw said \"Intersectionality was a prism to bring to light dynamics within discrimination law that weren't being appreciated by the courts.\"\n\nMandatory minimums are one of the easiest laws to use to illustrate the need for critical race theory. Mandatory minimums refer to mandatory sentencing for crimes. This was a big push of the tough-on-crime laws of the 1970s and 1980s. The classic example is the sentencing for crack vs cocaine. While crack and cocaine are very similar drugs, crack was predominantly used in the Black community while cocaine was more common among white people. Therefore, those arrested for crack were more likely to be Black. Guess which drug had the harsher penalty? This was justified through the claims that crack was more addictive, led to more violent crime and caused the \" crack baby \" epidemic. It turns out none of that was true and there was no compelling state reason to treat crack and cocaine differently in terms of sentencing.\n\nSo without using any racialized language, and with a law applying equally to white and Black people, mandatory minimums managed to target Black people for incarceration at much higher rates than white people. This is a facially neutral discriminatory law . Do mandatory minimums have a racist intent? Probably. But it doesn't matter. The discriminatory impact is enough to show the harm. That is what critical race theory teaches us. In 1995, Derrick Bell famously asked \" Who's Afraid of Critical Race Theory ,\" but I hope after reading this you see critical race theory isn't scary at all."

      "text": "Why the GOP's attempts to ban 'critical race theory' unintentionally do the opposite\n\nby Jonathan Feingold , Boston University\n\nSince the final months of the Trump administration, the Republican Party has waged a sustained assault on critical race theory. Otherwise known as \"CRT,\" this academic framework offers tools to illuminate the relationship among race, racism and the law. Through calculated caricature and distortion, right-wing think tanks and media have weaponized CRT to manufacture a culture war that recasts antiracism as the new racism.\n\nThis campaign employs a well-worn script designed to sow racial division, galvanize voters and shield economic elites - and the systems they enable - from meaningful critique .\n\nThis campaign appears to be working. Anti-CRT messaging has emerged as a signature - and potent - GOP political talking point. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, for example, repeated a common refrain when she asserted the falsehood that \"critical race theory teaches people to judge others based on race, gender, or sexual identity, rather than the content of their character.\" More recently in Virginia, Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin closed his campaign with a pledge to \" ban critical race theory on Day One .\"\n\nPundits may have overstated CRT's impact in Virginia and beyond. But Youngkin's success cemented CRT as a favorite foil in the Republican playbook.\n\nOn the legislative front, between January and September 2021, Republicans invoked similar anti-CRT rhetoric to justify 54 bills across 24 states. At least 11 are now law.\n\nThe mainstream media keeps characterizing these laws as \"CRT bans.\" This framing is understandable and inviting. But often it distorts reality by mischaracterizing the laws themselves. Most of these bills - if you take seriously their actual text - call for more CRT, not less.\n\nConsider a bill recently passed by Wisconsin's Republican-dominated Assembly . The bill, which tracks legislation across the country, prohibits teachers from \"teach[ing]\" a series of banned \"concepts.\" This includes a ban against teaching that \"[o]ne race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex.\"\n\nNow imagine a 10th grade social studies class begins a unit on corporate America. The teacher opens with basic facts about Fortune 500 CEOs : 92.6% are white, 1% are Black, 3.4% are Latinx and 2.4% are Asian. These disparities exist against a backdrop in which roughly 60% of the U.S. population is white, 14.2% is Black, 18.7% is Latinx and 7.2% is Asian.\n\nThe teacher shares two additional facts. White men - roughly 35% of the population - hold 85.8% of CEO posts. Of the 83 women who have become CEOs since 2000, 72 were white, thereby comprising 86% of all female CEOs this century .\n\nThe statistics invite an inescapable question: Why do such glaring disparities exist?\n\nOne answer assumes today's CEOs are the product of fair and unbiased systems that reward talent and hard work. This response implies that white men, relative to everyone else, and white women, relative to women of color, are simply more talented and harder workers.\n\nIn effect, this story suggests that white men are inherently superior - the precise message that Wisconsin's bill prohibits.\n\nA different answer might explore whether the systems that produce CEOs are, in fact, fair and unbiased.\n\nThis is where CRT enters. Roughly 40 years ago , a group of legal scholars confronted a similar question: Why do profound racial disparities persist even when the law prohibits racial discrimination?\n\nFour decades later, these scholars - who would name their project critical race theory - have offered varying answers. These answers, many grounded in seminal work from professor Derrick Bell , have exposed the myriad ways that race and sex remain powerful determinants in America - even when laws prohibit race or sex discrimination.\n\nThe teacher in our example could bring this robust literature into her classroom. Doing so would comply with the Wisconsin bill and, importantly, enrich her students' learning.  She could, for example, assign writings from acclaimed critical race theorist Cheryl Harris, who exposed the often-invisible benefits whiteness can confer, even to poor white people.\n\nOur teacher could then draw on professor Kimberlé Crenshaw, a CRT co-founder, whose pathbreaking work urges us to explore how racism interacts with sexism, classism and homophobia - among other dimensions of identity.\n\nShe could also turn to legal scholar Jerry Kang, who has outlined why implicit biases often lead individuals and institutions to discriminate - even when we hold earnest egalitarian commitments.\n\nThough the specifics differ, the above scholars - and the collective CRT canon - offer a consistent insight: CEO white/male overrepresentation cannot be explained by some \"inherent superiority\" enjoyed by whites and men. Rather, contemporary disparities result, in large part, from race and gender - and often class - advantages and disadvantages embedded within the systems through which CEOs must pass.\n\nFor educators like me who have witnessed the benefits of a CRT-rich curriculum, it's welcome news that anti-CRT lawmakers are proposing and passing pro-CRT laws - even if unintentional and counterintuitive.\n\nBut in reality, these laws are unlikely to yield more CRT in classrooms - regardless of their actual language.\n\nThe GOP's anti-CRT crusade, as with related campaigns targeting trans youth and mask mandates, has never been about facts - let alone concern for legal text. This is about power, and \"anti-CRT\" laws empower private and public actors to target teachers who engage in even basic conversations about race and racism.\n\nA recent report from the free-speech advocacy group PEN America captures this dynamic.  After reviewing all 54 bills, PEN concluded: \"These bills appear designed to chill academic and educational discussions and impose government dictates on teaching and learning. In short: They are educational gag orders.\"\n\n[ Get the best of The Conversation, every weekend. Sign up for our weekly newsletter .]\n\nPEN further explained that even when bills do not become law, they \"send a potent message that educators are being watched and that ideological redlines exist.\"\n\nIn today's toxic political climate, this translates to less CRT in the classroom, even when the law - and sound teaching - demands more.\n\nJonathan Feingold , Associate Professor of Law, Boston University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Here's the truth behind the right-wing attacks on critical race theory\n\nWhen North Carolina public school teacher Justin Parmenter penned an opinion piece for the Charlotte Observer about the difficulties of teaching in hybrid mode during the pandemic, with students both in-person in the classroom and remote online, he didn't expect to get called out by a legislator on the floor of the state House of Representatives.\n\nThe main point of his editorial, Parmenter told me in a phone call, was that teaching his seventh-grade class in the hybrid model isn't sustainable because it forces teachers to make compromises that limit the learning opportunities of their students.\n\nBut that point was not what Iredell County Republican Representative Jeff McNeely was compelled to comment on. Instead, he attacked Parmenter, who was named a finalist for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools Teacher of the Year in 2016, for attempting to \"indoctrinate\" his students about \"environmental pollution.\"\n\nAs Parmenter explains on his personal blog, McNeely's remarks referred to a piece of writing Parmenter asked his students to respond to that happened to be about pollution, and McNeely made his comment in the context of a discussion in the House about a new bill, HB 755 , that \"would require schools to post online a comprehensive list of all teaching, classroom, and assignment materials used by every teacher in every class session,\" according to WRAL . McNeely spoke out in support of the bill in the House Education Committee meeting because he felt it would \"help the parents going to the next grade be able to look and see what that teacher taught the year before\" and, apparently, avoid having their children exposed to teachers who would \"teach 'em in a certain way to make 'em believe something other than the facts.\"\n\nAside from pollution being, indeed, a fact , what HB 755 proposes is impractical, to say the least, Parmenter told me. \"Teaching is an art form,\" he said, with multiple opportunities for \"teachable moments\" to arise spontaneously during every lesson. Having to document that would not only be tedious busywork, but it could also discourage teachers from tailoring instruction to students.\n\nParmenter suspects that McNeely's comment, rather than being an honest discourse on pedagogy, is more likely a ham-handed attempt at making a \"cheap political point.\"\n\n\"It's not surprising,\" Parmenter said, \"given the current national context.\"\n\nThe national context he was referring to is the wave of agitation drummed up by right-wing political organizations and Republican politicians over the perceived \"indoctrination\" of students that occurs in public schools.\n\n'None of This Is Really About Critical Race Theory'\n\nA prominent flashpoint in this upheaval is the supposed infiltration of the teaching of critical race theory (CRT) in public school curricula. The controversy \"exploded in the public arena this spring,\" reports Education Week , \"especially in K-12, where numerous state legislatures are debating bills seeking to ban... [CRT's] use in the classroom.\"\n\nThe bills have surfaced in at least 15 states, according to Education Week. That includes North Carolina's version, which debuted in May, NC Policy Watch reported.\n\nThe bills repeat a nearly identical set of prohibitions on \"how teachers can discuss racism, sexism, and other social issues,\" according to Education Week, using language similar to that of an \"executive order former President Donald Trump put in place to ban diversity training for federal workers .\" President Biden has rescinded that order, but efforts to ban diversity training are continuing in universities and school districts, according to the Washington Post, where the focus of legislation has extended beyond employee training to include school curricula and teaching practices.\n\nThe specifics in these bills ban teachers from addressing concepts related to race and gender, for instance, prohibiting teachers from making anyone \" feel discomfort or guilt \" because of their race or gender. But the list of transgressions seems purposefully vague and general, almost as if to invite a lawsuit, explains Adam Harris in the Atlantic. And proponents of the bills have adopted critical race theory, an academic idea dating back to the 1970s, as a \"shorthand\" for their concerns.\n\n\"But none of this is really about CRT,\" James Ford told me in a phone call. Ford is a former North Carolina Teacher of the Year who currently represents the Southwest Education Region on the North Carolina State Board of Education and serves as the executive director of the Center for Racial Equity in Education .\n\n\"First, in these calls to stop the teaching of CRT,\" he said, \"there is no clarification of what CRT really is. There's no argumentative critique of the actual concept.\" Indeed, many of the bills don't even mention the term.\n\nThe real target, Ford explained, is \"divisiveness.\" For the people who criticize teachers and promote these bills, Ford believes, there can be \"no nuance at all\" in discussing \"matters of religion and customs and the values of rugged individualism and free-market ideology.\" There can be no challenges of assumptions and no revising of long-standing mythologies about America and American society.\n\nAccording to Ford, these people see education as a process about \"making kids assimilate,\" and \"simply talking about a subject like pollution takes on a heightened sense of alarm about society being undermined.\"\n\nOutlawing 'Divisiveness' in Schools\n\nMany of the bills specifically target the banning of teaching \"divisive concepts,\" according to Politico , with one bill, in West Virginia, going so far as to call for teachers to be \"dismissed or not reemployed for teaching... divisive concepts.\"\n\nProposed laws against \"divisiveness\" in schools prompt Ford to question, \"Divisive for who?\" and he notes that the people behind all these bills are overwhelmingly white, wealthier folks who have generally benefited most from the nation's education system. Ford suggests they may be provoking white resentment against public schools because schools are now more populated with Black and Brown children who may express doubts about a prevailing narrative about the country that may not include people who look like them.\n\nFord also finds it ironic that people who are intent on outlawing school \"indoctrination\" have chosen to impose their own agenda by attacking critical thinking and questioning of cultural norms, which, to him, is what truly sounds like indoctrination.\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, it would be nearly impossible to police what goes on inside hundreds of thousands of classrooms. And it's hard to imagine how teachers of American history would steer clear of violating these laws while teaching about the Trail of Tears, slavery, the Civil War, and the suffragette and Civil Rights movements, or how English teachers could engage students in writing while avoiding current events and topics that are apt to elicit meaningful responses from students.\n\nBecause these concerted attacks on public schools and teachers make little sense academically, they have prompted many observers to consider whether there is more of a political intent behind the effort.\n\nParmenter suggested that attacks on schools and teachers are an attempt to change political momentum at a time when national leadership under a Democratic presidential administration enjoys high approval ratings.\n\nNew York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg seems to agree, writing , \"Part of the reason the right is putting so much energy into this crusade [against the teaching of CRT] is because it can't whip up much opposition to the bulk of Joe Biden's agenda.\" She concludes, \"Telling parents that liberals want to make their kids hate their country and feel guilty for being white might be absurd and cynical. It also looks like it might be effective.\"\n\nBut that argument makes sense only if you ignore the other education agenda right-wing politicians have rolled out at the very same time they are whipping up white resentment over diversity in schools.\n\nSchool Choice's 'Best Year Ever'\n\nIt's certainly no coincidence that in many states where there are bills attacking the teaching of divisive topics-including Georgia , Missouri , Arkansas , Iowa , South Dakota , and West Virginia -state lawmakers are also considering or enacting new \"school choice\" laws to create or expand programs that give parents vouchers so they can remove their children from public schools and send them to private schools at taxpayer expense. Other school choice acts create or expand programs that give parents taxpayer dollars to spend on homeschooling and other educational expenses they incur for their children.\n\nThe 2020-2021 school year has been the \"best year ever\" for school choice advocates, says Alan Greenblatt on Governing: The Future of States and Localities . Greenblatt notes the proliferation of new laws has created education savings accounts that give parents public funds to pay for \"a wide range of education-related services.\" Other laws create or expand state tax-credit programs that funnel donations from businesses and wealthy people into school vouchers for parents.\n\nMany of these new provisions have been passed in states that had previously resisted school choice programs-such as Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, and West Virginia-or that-like Georgia, Maryland, Montana, and South Dakota-had very small programs that are now ballooning into massive redistributions of public funds for education.\n\n\"States that were long resistant [to school choice] have now opened up,\" Greenblatt observes, and once the programs start up, regardless of how small, \"they tend to expand, not contract.\"\n\nGreenblatt credits the pandemic for creating a lot of the momentum for this expansion of school laws. But he also quotes education historian Jack Schneider who notes that the drive for more school choice was accelerating long before COVID-19, during the expansions of charter schools under former President Barack Obama and through the fiery denunciations of \" government schools \" by former President Donald Trump's Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.\n\nIndeed, school choice proponents like the conservative Manhattan Institute have long contended that a public school system funded by government, but with private entities providing the education services, should be \"the democratic norm\" for the nation. They call privatization of the school system \"educational pluralism,\" as opposed to the apparent divisiveness of publicly operated institutions.\n\n\"Public schooling forces zero-sum conflict such as we are seeing over CRT,\" writes Neal McCluskey, the director of the libertarian Cato Institute's Center for Educational Freedom, in RealClearPolicy. Of course, this \"conflict\" is \"zero-sum,\" as James Ford points out, only if you insist it is.\n\nBut school choice proponents like McCluskey argue that having a public system that allows people from different backgrounds to come together and share varying points of view is not \"diverse\" at all because it might open a window to a critique of America that potentially \"demonizes\" the country.\n\nInstead, in this up-is-down and down-is-up view of the world, the only way to solve divisiveness, according to McCluskey, is by \"letting millions of families and educators choose for themselves\" by funding a system of privately operated schools that cater only to those parents who already share the same ideologies.\n\nMcCluskey might be correct that such a system could \"end heated disagreement over ideas like CRT\" in schools, but it certainly would guarantee these conflicts spill over into other arenas for these students later in life, when they become adults whose views have hardened and become more resistant to change because they never experienced real diversity of thought during their formative years.\n\n\"[A] new era of school choice vouchers may be parents' best defense against public school curricula,\" warned former Attorney General William Barr, according to Just the News, in his first public speech since leaving office under the Trump administration in December.\n\n\"Barr suggested,\" Just the News reports , that \"some of the new woke curricula pushed by the left might infringe religious and speech freedoms and impose a secular theology that violates the Constitution's Establishment Clause prohibiting government from imposing religious beliefs.\"\n\nNo doubt, as the effects of the pandemic wane in many places due to vaccinations, fearmongering over supposed divisiveness in public schools will only grow. It is likely that there will be a ratcheting up of the rhetoric for greater school choice to enable parents to escape the supposed adverse consequences of being exposed to anything other than long-accepted narratives about subjects, regardless of a changing world.\n\nA new nonprofit launched in March, Parents Defending Education (PDE), has targeted \"woke indoctrination\" in schools, Fox News reports. PDE \"is just the latest\" organization to take up the cause, according to the article, which also lists Discovery Institute , Oregonians for Liberty in Education , and Parents Against Critical Race Theory.\n\nAccording to Education Week , PDE has already targeted school districts around the country with federal civil rights complaints against schools that address systemic racism. The article notes that \"[PDE] staffers work or previously worked at organizations such as the Cato Institute,\"-where McCluskey works-the Thomas B. Fordham Institute , and Coalition for TJ . The Cato and Fordham institutes are ardent proponents of school choice , and Coalition for TJ has filed a lawsuit to stop changes to admission standards that would allow more enrollment diversity at a Virginia high school.\n\nFord agrees that these attacks on \"woke\" indoctrination in schools are \"unequivocally related to efforts to privatize education,\" and he points out that many of the same people orchestrating these new laws targeting public education are strong proponents of school choice. \"Historically, there is a pattern connecting race issues and privatization,\" he says.\n\nNumerous studies have found evidence supporting Ford's argument, but it's not at all hard to imagine that an effective strategy for pushing white families out of public schools is to raise fears that their children are being indoctrinated with values and beliefs that could divide them ideologically or emotionally and draw a wedge between them and their families and neighbors.\n\nNor is it a stretch to believe that families of color, seeing white families become enraged about the teaching of structural racism, would consider fleeing a public school to find a privately operated alternative that would be more culturally affirming for their children.\n\n'I Don't Think That's Funny at All'\n\nIn the meantime, public school teachers will be increasingly scapegoated by conservative advocates who are stigmatizing the idea of addressing controversial topics in schools. Proponents of these laws seem to not know teachers \"have to leave our politics at the door,\" Parmenter told me, and these conservative advocates seem to believe teachers \"don't have the integrity and professionalism to understand that [they] know there are lines you simply don't cross.\"\n\nParmenter senses that the negative impact these laws will have on the teaching corps, already reeling from the stress caused by the pandemic, may discourage future teachers from entering a profession where they're constantly under the watchful eye of people who may not respect them and understand how they do their job.\n\n\"Less mysterious\" to him are the negative impacts these attacks on public schools and teaching will have on students.\n\n\"For children to learn how to read and write, they need to engage with a variety of different texts,\" he says, and while he found Representative McNeely's accusations of \"indoctrination\" somewhat comedic-\"like because I just happened to mention that the piece of writing my class focused on was about pollution, that made him think, 'I just caught one of these Commies admitting what they are up to'\"-Parmenter fears any new law that is so \"invasive of teachers\" will ultimately be harmful to their students. \"And I don't think that's funny at all.\"\n\nThis article was produced by Our Schools .

      "text": "How the critical race theory hysteria may be a death blow for affirmative action\n\nThe end of abortion rights in the United States seems to be a foregone conclusion. After rejecting efforts to temporarily halt the Texas abortion law on two separate occasions, the Supreme Court may validate the law this term. Undermining Roe v. Wade , or overruling it as the court's decision on Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban portends, begs the question of what other precedents the Supreme Court will be willing to weaken or abandon.\n\nAffirmative action in higher education immediately comes to mind.\n\nWith the replacement of Justice Anthony Kennedy-who famously helped reaffirm the constitutionality of affirmative action in Fisher v. University of Texas -upon his retirement with Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and the subsequent filling of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the days of affirmative action seem as numbered as those of legalized abortions. Conservatives, skeptical of the justification for affirmative action, enjoy a majority on the Supreme Court. A viable challenge to affirmative action that was only recently shot down in federal court may receive a more favorable ruling if it is heard by a more sympathetic conservative Supreme Court.\n\nAs with abortion rights, it is possible for Congress to enact legislation that protects affirmative action policies. However, the current national conversation on critical race theory suggests that these efforts would face an uphill battle.\n\nThe New Culture War\n\nConservative politicians, pundits, activists, and parents united during the summer of 2021 to face a common enemy. No, that enemy was not the likely candidate of the coronavirus pandemic, which so far has killed more than 700,000 Americans and counting. Nor was it the insurrectionists and anti-democracy extremists who falsely claim that the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump. No, these allies banded together to engage in a meaningless culture war against critical race theory.\n\nThe tragic murder of George Floyd in 2020 was a cultural inflection point that has inspired national introspection on the ways in which racism has permeated every facet of American life. Everyday citizens have incorporated terms like \"white privilege,\" \"implicit bias,\" and \"microaggression\" into their vocabularies. Corporations are beginning to promote internal diversity and contribute to the economic development of historically marginalized communities. Educational institutions at all levels are encouraging conversations and offering courses on institutionalized racism, which is at the core of critical race theory. But for every positive action, there is an equally opposite negative reaction.\n\nLocal school board meetings have become battlegrounds . Parents and conservative activists have accused schools of using critical race theory to \" indoctrinate \" their children and spread \" Marxism .\" These accusations may be the least of school districts' concerns: School board members have received threats to their safety, while many school boards have become engulfed in litigation, complaints, and record requests relating to critical race theory. Conservatives at all levels have egged on these efforts from the Fox News Network, which obsessed over critical race theory to the tune of mentioning it 1,900 times in under four months, to Trump acolyte and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who blasted critical race theory as \"[t]eaching kids to hate their country and to hate each other.\"\n\nHarmful rhetoric is now giving way to tangible consequences. States like South Carolina and Idaho have passed legislation to prevent schools from teaching the principles of critical race theory. Oklahoma passed legislation clearly intended to shape the contours of how discussions of race can occur in the classroom. The debate over the place of the tenets of critical race theory in the classroom threatens to tip the scales in the Virginia governor's race . Federal conservative lawmakers have joined the chorus of criticisms, including Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Representative Dan Bishop (R-NC), both of whom introduced the Stop CRT Act.\n\nAn Uncertain Future\n\nThe central irony of this nonsensical hysteria is that critical race theory is a legal framework taught in law and graduate schools, not primary and secondary schools. Discussions of history, racism, and diversity are not synonymous with critical race theory, so no children were ever in so-called danger of being exposed to this pedagogy. But Republicans are well aware of the provocative nature of the term \"critical race theory.\" The potential to wield that term like a battle-ax to frighten suburban white voters and ultimately frustrate progress on racial justice issues was too tempting for conservatives to ignore. That this fearmongering political strategy is working, based on the explosion of interest in school board affairs, could be the death knell for affirmative action.\n\nBefore critical race theory, affirmative action was the buzzword deployed by conservatives to stoke racial division . Affirmative action has always been a controversial policy. But if this level of panic is the reaction to the mere discussion of racial inequality in schools, one can only imagine how apoplectic the reaction will be to Congress seeking to preserve or even expand affirmative action. One thing is for certain: Outrage at the presence of racial discussions in the classrooms means that there is already a coalition of opponents mobilized to challenge codifying affirmative action.\n\nStanding at the cusp of losing abortion rights has galvanized progressives, but it is hard to envision affirmative action inspiring that same level of activism, even among those who might be somewhat sympathetic. Indeed, protests against the Texas abortion law began almost immediately after it went into effect in September. Nationwide marches hosted by the Women's March to vocalize support for abortion rights totaled at least 600. Whole Woman's Health , which is part of a network of abortion clinics, sued for an injunction against the Texas abortion law. Spearheaded by women in Congress, the Women's Health Protection Act of 2021, which would maintain a woman's right to abort her pregnancy, passed in the House of Representatives.\n\nAttaining higher education is still a relative privilege , by contrast, so affirmative action is not as energizing a principle as abortion rights-which directly impact half the population-theoretically are. An argument, though one with which I disagree, could also be made that the stakes of affirmative action are not as high as other racial justice issues, including voting rights and police brutality. While legislation to address these focuses stalls, progressives in Congress may be reluctant to add protecting affirmative action to their list of priorities. As seen from the example of some conservative lawmakers in Congress who have been vocal leaders in the fight to keep racial history out of the classroom, there is no guarantee that legislation to preserve affirmative action policies would be enacted even with the enthusiasm of congressional Democrats.\n\nFurthermore, public opinion on affirmative action is tepid. Although Gallup determined that 62 percent of Americans broadly endorse \"affirmative action programs for racial minorities,\" there are indications that support narrows with respect to affirmative action in the context of higher education specifically. Shortly before the lawsuit against Harvard's affirmative action policy was set to be heard, WGBH News conducted a poll in which 72 percent of respondents opposed the Supreme Court jurisprudence allowing a person's racial background to factor into admissions decisions. Perhaps most tellingly, California voters opposed restoring the state's capacity to consider race, along with other identity elements, in admitting students to its public universities and hiring public employees. An argument could be made that if affirmative action could not survive in liberal California, what hope does it have of achieving national protection?\n\nThe anger surrounding teaching children a more expansive (and truthful) version of American history can largely be understood as a backlash to the Black Lives Matter era, the victories of which have been largely symbolic and localized . The legislative entrenchment of affirmative action will be spun by conservatives as \" reverse racism \" that hampers the educational advancement of white children. That argument will hold traction among conservatives, moderates, and progressives. As we prepare for the possibility of a post- Roe future, it might also be time to anticipate a future in which affirmative action is unavailable as a means of promoting diversity in and economic mobility through higher education."

      "text": "There Is No Debate Over Critical Race Theory\n\nPundits and politicians have created their own definition for the term, and then set about attacking it.\n\nThe United States is not in the midst of a \"culture war\" over race and racism. The animating force of our current conflict is not our differing values, beliefs, moral codes, or practices. The American people aren't divided. The American people are being divided.\n\nRepublican operatives have buried the actual definition of critical race theory : \"a way of looking at law's role platforming, facilitating, producing, and even insulating racial inequality in our country,\" as the law professor Kimberlé Crenshaw, who helped coin the term, recently defined it. Instead, the attacks on critical race theory are based on made-up definitions and descriptors. \"Critical race theory says every white person is a racist,\" Senator Ted Cruz has said . \"It basically teaches that certain children are inherently bad people because of the color of their skin,\" said the Alabama state legislator Chris Pringle.\n\nThere are differing points of view about race and racism. But what we are seeing and hearing on news shows, in school-district meetings, in op-ed pages, in legislative halls, and in social-media feeds aren't multiple sides with differing points of view. There's only one side in our so-called culture war right now.\n\nConor Friedersdorf: Critical race theory is making both parties flip-flop\n\nThe Republican operatives, who dismiss the expositions of critical race theorists and anti-racists in order to define critical race theory and anti-racism, and then attack those definitions, are effectively debating themselves . They have conjured an imagined monster to scare the American people and project themselves as the nation's defenders from that fictional monster.\n\nThe evangelist Pat Robertson recently called critical race theory \"a monstrous evil.\" And over the past year, that \"monstrous evil\" has supposedly been growing many legs. First, Republicans pointed to Black Lives Matter demonstrators. Three days after George Floyd's murder last year, President Donald Trump recast the largely peaceful demonstrators as violent and dishonorable \"THUGS.\" By the end of July, Trump had framed them as \"anarchists who hate our country.\"\n\nThen \"cancel culture\" was targeted. At the Republican National Convention in August, Trump blasted \"cancel culture\" as seeking to coerce Americans \"into saying what you know to be false and scare you out of saying what you know to be true.\"\n\nNext came attacks on the 1619 Project and American history. \"Despite the virtues and accomplishments of this Nation, many students are now taught in school to hate their own country, and to believe that the men and women who built it were not heroes, but rather villains,\" read Trump's executive order on November 2, establishing the President's Advisory 1776 Commission.\n\nAnd now the Black Lives Matter demonstrators, cancel culture, the 1619 Project, American history , and anti-racist education are presented to the public as the many legs of the \"monstrous evil\" of critical race theory that's purportedly coming to harm white children. The language echoes the rhetoric used to demonize desegregation after the Brown v. Board of Education decision, in 1954.\n\nIn the 1950s and '60s, the conservators of racism organized to keep Black kids out of all-white schools. Today, they are trying to get critical race theory out of American schools. \"Instead of helping young people discover that America is the greatest, most tolerant, and most generous nation in history, [critical race theory] teaches them that America is systemically evil and that the hearts of our people are full of hatred and malice,\" Trump wrote in an op-ed on June 18.\n\nAfter it was cited 132 times on Fox News shows in 2020, critical race theory became a conservative obsession this year. Its mentions on Fox News practically doubled month after month: It was referred to 51 times in February, 139 times in March, 314 times in April, 589 times in May, and 737 times in just the first three weeks of June. As of June 29, 26 states had introduced legislation or other state-level actions to \"restrict teaching critical race theory or limit how teachers can discuss racism and sexism,\" according to Education Week , and nine had implemented such bans.\n\nI have been called the father of critical race theory, although I was born in 1982, and critical race theory was born in 1981. Over the past few months, I have seldom stopped to answer the critiques of critical race theory or of my own work, because the more I've studied these critiques, the more I've concluded that these critics aren't arguing against me. They aren't arguing against anti-racist thinkers. They aren't arguing against critical race theorists. These critics are arguing against themselves .\n\nRead: The GOP's 'critical race theory' obsession\n\nWhat happens when a politician falsely proclaims what you think, and then criticizes that proclamation? Is she really critiquing your ideas-or her own? If a writer decides what both sides of an argument are stating, is he really engaging in an argument with another writer, or is he engaging in an argument with himself?\n\nTake the journalist Matthew Yglesias. In February , in The Washington Post , he wrote that I think that \"any racial gap simply is racist by definition; any policy that maintains such a gap is a racist policy; and-most debatably-any intellectual explanation of its existence (sociological, cultural and so on) is also racist.\" But nowhere have I written that the racial gap is racist: The policies and practices causing the racial gap are racist. Nowhere have I stated that any intellectual explanation of the existence of a racial gap is racist. Only intellectual explanations of a racial gap that point to the superiority or inferiority of a racial group are racist.\n\nWas Yglesias really arguing against me, or was he arguing against himself? What about the columnist Ross Douthat? In a recent op-ed in The New York Times , he did what GOP thinkers keep doing to Americans striving to construct an equitable and just society: re-create us as extremists, as monsters to be feared for speaking out against racism. Douthat accused me of \"ideological extremism that embarrasses clever liberals,\" comparing me to the late Rush Limbaugh. I've spent my career writing evidence-based historical scholarship and demonstrating my willingness to be vulnerable; Limbaugh had no interest in being self-critical , and for decades attacked truth and facts and evidence.\n\nDouthat claimed that I have a \"Manichaean vision of public policy, in which all policymaking is either racist or antiracist, all racial disparities are the result of racism-and the measurement of any outcome short of perfect 'equity' may be a form of structural racism itself.\"\n\nWhere did he get perfect equity? In How to Be an Antiracist , I define racial equity as a state \"when two or more racial groups are standing on a relatively equal footing.\" I proposed that an example of racial equity would be \"if there were relatively equitable percentages\" of racial groups \"living in owner-occupied homes in the forties, seventies, or, better, nineties.\" By contrast , in 2014, 71 percent of white families lived in owner-occupied homes, compared with 45 percent of Latino families and 41 percent of Black families. That's racial inequity.\n\nWhat we write doesn't matter to the people arguing with themselves. It doesn't matter that I consistently challenge Manichaean racial visions of inherently good or evil people or policy making. It doesn't matter that I don't write about policy making being good or evil, or that I write about the equitable or inequitable outcome of policies. It doesn't matter that I've urged us toward relative equity, and not toward perfect equity.\n\nIf you want to understand why I've made these arguments, you first need to recognize that for decades, right-wing thinkers and judges have argued that policies that lead to racial inequities are \"not racist\" or are \"race neutral.\" That was the position of the conservative Supreme Court justices who recently upheld Arizona's voting-restriction policies. Those who wish to conserve racial inequity want us to focus on intent-which is hard to prove-rather than the outcome of inequity, which is rather easy to prove. Case in point: GOP state legislators are claiming that the 28 laws they've enacted in 17 states as of June 21 are about election security, even though voter fraud is a practically nonexistent problem. They claim that these laws aren't intended to make it harder for Black voters or members of other minority groups to cast ballots, even as experts find that's precisely what such laws have done in the past, and predict that's likely what these new laws will do as well.\n\nJarvis R. Givens: What's missing from the discourse about anti-racist teaching\n\nThese critics aren't just making up their claims as they go along. They are making up the sources of their criticism as they go along. Douthat argues that work like mine \"extends structural analysis beyond what it can reasonably bear, into territory where white supremacy supposedly explains Asian American success on the SAT.\" Who is giving this explanation other than Douthat? I'm surely not. I point to other explanations, including the history of highly educated Asian immigrants and the concentration of score-boosting test-prep companies in Asian (and white) neighborhoods.\n\nWhite supremacy does explain why more than three-quarters of the perpetrators of anti-Asian hate crimes and incidents before and during the pandemic have been white. Asian American success as measured by test scores, education, and income should not erase the impact of structural racism on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. This group now has the highest income inequality of any racial group in the United States. Asian Americans in New York experienced the highest surge of unemployment of any racial group during the pandemic. Do the critics of critical race theory want us to think of the AAPI community as not just a \"model minority,\" but a model monolith? Showcasing AAPIs to maintain the fiction of a postracial society ends up erasing Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\n\nCritical race theory has been falsely labeled as anti-Asian. Helen Raleigh, an Asian American entrepreneur, defined critical race theory as a \"divisive discriminatory ideology that judges people on the basis of their skin color\" in Newsweek . \"It is my practice to ignore critics who have not read the work and who are not interested in honest exchange,\" responded one of the three Asian American founders of critical race theory, Mari Matsuda, a law professor at the University of Hawaii. \"But I do want to say this for the record: Asian Americans are at the center of CRT analysis and have been from the start.\"\n\nHow should thinkers respond to monstrous lies? Should we mostly ignore the critics as Matsuda has, as I have? Because restating facts over and over again gets old. Reciting your own work over and over again to critics who either haven't read what they are criticizing or are purposefully distorting it gets old. And talking with people who have created a monologue with two points of view, theirs and what they impute to you, gets old.\n\nBut democracy needs dialogue. And dialogue necessitates seeking to know what a person is saying in order to offer informed critiques.\n\nAs a scholar, I know that nothing is more useful than criticism to improve my scholarship. As a human being, I know that nothing is more constructive than criticism to improve my humanity. I've chronicled how criticism and critics have been a driving force on my journey to be anti-racist, to confront my own racist, sexist, homophobic, and classist ideas-and their intersections. Constructive criticism often hurts, but like painful medical treatments, it can be lifesaving; it can be nation-saving.\n\nBut what's happening now is something entirely different and destructive-not constructive. This isn't a \"culture war.\" This isn't even an \"argument.\" This isn't even \"criticism.\" This is critics arguing with themselves.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "The GOP's 'Critical Race Theory' Obsession\n\nHow conservative politicians and pundits became fixated on an academic approach\n\nO n January 12, Keith Ammon, a Republican member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, introduced a bill that would bar schools as well as organizations that have entered into a contract or subcontract with the state from endorsing \"divisive concepts.\" Specifically, the measure would forbid \"race or sex scapegoating,\" questioning the value of meritocracy, and suggesting that New Hampshire-or the United States-is \"fundamentally racist.\"\n\nAmmon's bill is one of a dozen that Republicans have recently introduced in state legislatures and the United States Congress that contain similar prohibitions. In Arkansas, lawmakers have approved a measure that would ban state contractors from offering training that promotes \"division between, resentment of, or social justice for\" groups based on race, gender, or political affiliation. The Idaho legislature just passed a bill that would bar institutions of public education from compelling \"students to personally affirm, adopt, or adhere\" to specific beliefs about race, sex, or religion. The Louisiana legislature is weighing a nearly identical measure.\n\nThe language of these bills is anodyne and fuzzy- compel , for instance, is never defined in the Idaho legislation-and that ambiguity appears to be deliberate. According to Ammon, \"using taxpayer funds to promote ideas such as 'one race is inherently superior to another race or sex' ... only exacerbates our differences.\" But critics of these efforts warn that the bills would effectively prevent public schools and universities from holding discussions about racism; the New Hampshire measure in particular would ban companies that do business with government entities from conducting diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. \"The vagueness of the language is really the point,\" Leah Cohen, an organizer with Granite State Progress, a liberal nonprofit based in Concord, told me. \"With this really broad brushstroke, we anticipate that that will be used more to censor conversations about race and equity.\"\n\nRead: The real stakes of the fight over history\n\nMost legal scholars say that these bills impinge on the right to free speech and will likely be dismissed in court. \"Of the legislative language so far, none of the bills are fully constitutional,\" Joe Cohn, the legislative and policy director of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, told me, \"and if it isn't fully constitutional, there's a word for that: It means it's unconstitutional.\" This does not appear to concern the bills' sponsors, though. The larger purpose, it seems, is to rally the Republican base-to push back against the recent reexaminations of the role that slavery and segregation have played in American history and the attempts to redress those historical offenses. The shorthand for the Republicans' bogeyman is an idea that has until now mostly lived in academia: critical race theory.\n\nT he late Harvard Law professor Derrick Bell is credited as the father of critical race theory. He began conceptualizing the idea in the 1970s as a way to understand how race and American law interact, and developed a course on the subject. In 1980, Bell resigned his position at Harvard because of what he viewed as the institution's discriminatory hiring practices, especially its failure to hire an Asian American woman he'd recommended.\n\nBlack students-including the future legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw, who enrolled at Harvard Law in 1981-felt the void created by his departure. Bell had been the only Black law professor among the faculty, and in his absence, the school no longer offered a course explicitly addressing race. When students asked administrators what could be done, Crenshaw says they received a terse response. \"What is it that is so special about race and law that you have to have a course that examines it?\" Crenshaw has recalled administrators asking. The administration's inability to see the importance of understanding race and the law, she says, \"got us thinking about how do we articulate that this is important and that law schools should include\" the subject in their curricula.\n\nCrenshaw and her classmates asked 12 scholars of color to come to campus and lead discussions about Bell's book Race, Racism, and American Law . With that, critical race theory began in earnest. The approach \"is often disruptive because its commitment to anti-racism goes well beyond civil rights, integration, affirmative action, and other liberal measures,\" Bell explained in 1995. The theory's proponents argue that the nation's sordid history of slavery, segregation, and discrimination is embedded in our laws, and continues to play a central role in preventing Black Americans and other marginalized groups from living lives untouched by racism.\n\nFor some, the theory was a revelatory way to understand inequality. Take housing, for example. Researchers have now accumulated ample evidence that racial covenants in property deeds and redlining by the Federal Housing Authority-banned more than 60 years ago-remain a major contributor to the gulf in homeownership, and thus wealth, between Black and white people. Others, perhaps most prominently Randall Kennedy, who joined the Harvard Law faculty a few years after Bell left, questioned how widely the theory could be applied. In a paper titled \"Racial Critiques of Legal Academia,\" Kennedy argued that white racism was not the only reason so few \"minority scholars\" were members of law-school faculties. Conservative scholars argued that critical race theory is reductive-that it treats race as the only factor in social identity.\n\nAs with other academic frameworks before it, the nuances of critical race theory-and the debate around it-were obscured when it escaped the ivory tower. It first entered public discourse in the early 1990s, when President Bill Clinton nominated the University of Pennsylvania Law School professor Lani Guinier to run the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. Republicans mounted an aggressive and ultimately successful campaign to prevent her appointment, tagging her the \"Quota Queen.\" Among the many reasons her adversaries said she was wrong for the job was that she had been \"championing a radical school of thought called 'critical race theory.'\" The theory soon stood in for anything resembling an examination of America's history with race. Conservatives would boil it down further: Critical race theory taught Americans to hate America. Today, across the country, school curricula and workplace trainings include materials that defenders and opponents alike insist are inspired by critical race theory but that academic critical race theorists do not characterize as such.\n\nFox News gave only passing thought to critical race theory until last year. The first mention on the network occurred after Bell died, in 2012. A video of President Barack Obama praising him 21 years earlier began circulating online. \"Open up your minds and your hearts to the words of Mr. Derrick Bell,\" Obama said. That introduction was followed by a hug between the two men, which Fox cited as further evidence of Obama's tendency to consort with radicals. A guest on Hannity offhandedly alluded to the theory during a segment on George Zimmerman's trial for the murder of Trayvon Martin in 2014; network regulars briefly referred to it twice in 2019. Then, in 2020, after Derek Chauvin was captured on video kneeling on George Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, and the United States became awash in anti-racist reading lists-some of which included books and articles that discussed critical race theory-Fox suddenly took a great interest in the idea. It became the latest in a long line of racialized topics (affirmative action perhaps being the most prominent) that the network has jumped on. Since June 5, 2020, the phrase has been invoked during 150 broadcasts.\n\nTa-Nehisi Coates: 'A hug that the media won't show'\n\nIf a single person bears the most responsibility for the surge in conservative interest in critical race theory, it is probably Christopher Rufo. Last summer, Rufo, a 36-year-old senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a libertarian think tank, received a tip from a municipal employee in Seattle. (Rufo had lived in the city and, in 2018, ran unsuccessfully for city council.) According to the whistleblower, the city was conducting \"internalized racial superiority\" training sessions for its employees. Rufo submitted a Freedom of Information Act request and wrote about his findings for the institute's public-policy magazine.\n\n\"In conceptual terms,\" Rufo wrote, \"the city frames the discussion around the idea that black Americans are reducible to the essential quality of 'blackness' and white Americans are reducible to the essential quality of 'whiteness'-that is, the new metaphysics of good and evil.\" The training was rampant, he wrote, infecting every part of the city's municipal system. \"It is part of a nationwide movement to make this kind of identity politics the foundation of our public discourse. It may be coming soon to a city or town near you.\" His article-which did not include the phrase critical race theory -inspired a rush of whistleblowers from school districts and federal agencies, who reached out to him complaining about diversity training they had been invited to attend or had heard about.\n\nA month later, Rufo employed the term for the first time in an article. \"Critical race theory-the academic discourse centered on the concepts of 'whiteness,' 'white fragility,' and 'white privilege'-is spreading rapidly through the federal government,\" he wrote. He related anecdotes about training influenced by critical race theory at the Environmental Protection Agency, the FBI, and the Treasury Department, among others. In early September, Tucker Carlson invited him on his Fox News show during which Rufo warned viewers that critical race theory had pervaded every institution of the federal government and was being \"weaponized\" against Americans. He called on President Donald Trump to ban such training in all federal departments.\n\n\"Luckily, the president was watching the show and instructed his Chief of Staff to contact me the next morning,\" Rufo wrote to me. (He would agree to be interviewed only by email.) Within three weeks, Trump had signed an executive order banning the use of critical race theory by federal departments and contractors in diversity training. \"And thus,\" he wrote to me, \"the real fight against critical race theory began.\"\n\nT rump's executive order was immediately challenged in court. Nonprofit organizations that provide these training sessions argued that the order violated their free-speech rights and hampered their ability to conduct their business. In December, a federal judge agreed; President Joe Biden rescinded the order the day he took office. But by then, critical race theory was already a part of the conservative lexicon. Since Trump's executive order, Rufo told me, he has provided his analysis \"to a half-dozen state legislatures, the United States House of Representatives, and the United States Senate.\" One such state legislature was New Hampshire's; on February 18, the lower chamber held a hearing to discuss Keith Ammon's bill. Rufo was among those who testified in support of it.\n\nConcerned that the measure might fail on its own, Republicans have now included its language in a must-pass budget bill. In March, Republican Governor Chris Sununu signaled that he would object to \"divisive concepts\" legislation because he believes it is unconstitutional, but he has since tempered his stand. \"The ideas of critical race theory and all of this stuff-I personally don't think there's any place for that in schools,\" he said in early April. But, he added, \"when you start turning down the path of the government banning things, I think that's a very slippery slope.\" Almost everyone I spoke with for this article assumed that Sununu would sign the budget bill, and that the divisive-concepts ban would become law.\n\nAlthough free-speech advocates are confident that bills like Ammon's will not survive challenges in court, they believe the real point is to scare off companies, schools, and government agencies from discussing systemic racism. \"What these bills are designed to do is prevent conversations about how racism exists at a systemic level in that we all have implicit biases that lead to decisions that, accumulated, lead to significant racial disparities,\" Gilles Bissonnette, the legal director of the ACLU of New Hampshire, told me. \"The proponents of this bill want none of those discussions to happen. They want to suppress that type of speech.\"\n\nConservatives are not the only critics of diversity training. For years, some progressives, including critical race theorists, have questioned its value: Is it performative? Is it the most effective way to move toward equity or is it simply an effective way of restating the obvious and stalling meaningful action? But that is not the fight that has materialized over the past nine months. Instead, it is a confrontation with a cartoonish version of critical race theory.\n\nConor Friedersdorf: Can Chloé Valdary Sell Skeptics on DEI?\n\nFor Republicans, the end goal of all these bills is clear: initiating another battle in the culture wars and holding on to some threadbare mythology of the nation that has been challenged in recent years. What's less clear is whether average voters care much about the debate. In a recent Atlantic /Leger poll, 52 percent of respondents who identified as Republicans said that states should pass laws banning schools from teaching critical race theory, but just 30 percent of self-identified independents were willing to say the same. Meanwhile, a strong majority of Americans, 78 percent, either had not heard of critical race theory or were unsure whether they had.\n\nLast week, after President Biden's first joint address to Congress-and as Idaho was preparing to pass its bill-Senator Tim Scott stood in front of United States and South Carolina flags to deliver the Republican response. \"From colleges to corporations to our culture, people are making money and gaining power by pretending we haven't made any progress,\" Scott said. \"You know this stuff is wrong. Hear me clearly: America is not a racist country.\" Rufo immediately knew what he meant. \"Senator Tim Scott denounces critical race theory in his response to Biden's speech tonight,\" he tweeted. \"We have turned critical race theory into a national issue and conservative political leaders are starting to fight.\"\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "'It's Making Us More Ignorant'\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis's anti-critical-race-theory legislation is already changing how professors in Florida teach.\n\nThis article is a collaboration between The Atlantic and ProPublica.\n\nJ onathan Cox faced an agonizing decision. He was scheduled to teach two classes this past fall at the University of Central Florida that would explore color-blind racism, the concept that ostensibly race-neutral practices can have a discriminatory impact. The first, \"Race and Social Media,\" featured a unit on \"racial ideology and color-blindness.\" The second, \"Race and Ethnicity,\" included a reading on \"the myth of a color-blind society.\" An assistant sociology professor, Cox had taught both courses before; they typically drew 35 to 40 undergraduates apiece.\n\nAs recently as August 2021, Cox had doubted that the controversy over critical race theory-which posits, among other things, that racism is ingrained in America's laws and power structure-would hamstring his teaching. Asked on a podcast what instructors would do if, as anticipated, Florida restricted the teaching of CRT in higher education, he said that they would need to avoid certain buzzwords. \"What many of us are looking at doing is just maybe shifting some of the language that we're using.\"\n\nBut a clash with state law seemed inevitable, once Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, proposed what he called the strongest legislation in the nation against \"the state-sanctioned racism that is critical race theory.\" Last April, DeSantis signed the Individual Freedom Act, also known as the \"Stop Woke Act,\" into law. It bans teaching that one race or gender is morally superior to another, and prohibits teachers from making students feel guilty for past discrimination by members of their race. And it specifically bars portraying racial color-blindness-which the law labels a virtue-as racist. A DeSantis spokesperson, Jeremy Redfern, told me in an email that the law \" protects the open exchange of ideas\" (italics in the original) by prohibiting teachers from \"forcing discriminatory concepts on students.\"\n\nWhatever one thinks of critical race theory, the state's interference limits the freedom of professors who are experts in their fields to decide what to teach their students. Cox worried, not without reason, that the law effectively banned him from discussing his ideas in class, and that teaching the courses could cost him his livelihood. Cox, who is the only Black professor in the sociology department, will not be considered for tenure until this fall. His salary was his family's only income while his wife stayed home with their baby.\n\nRead: Just wait until you get to know DeSantis\n\nA month before the fall 2022 semester was set to start, he scrapped both courses. Students scrambled to register for other classes. \"It didn't seem like it was worth the risk,\" said Cox, who taught a graduate course on Inequality and Education instead. \"I'm completely unprotected.\" He added, \"Somebody who's not even in the class could come after me. Somebody sees the course catalog, complains to a legislator-next thing I know, I'm out of a job.\"\n\nCox's decision, along with another professor's cancellation of a graduate course because of a similar anxiety, created an unusual gap in the sociology curriculum at UCF. Located in Orlando, UCF is Florida's largest university, with almost 69,000 students.\n\nCox's department chair, Elizabeth Mustaine, said she went along with the professors' wishes because \"I thought, I'm not going to stress anyone out about this. It's crazy. \" Still, she added, \"it's an absolute tragedy that classes like this get canceled.\" Of the 39 courses offered this past fall by a department that specializes in the study of human society, none focused primarily on race.\n\nI n just over two years, critical race theory has gone from a largely obscure academic subject to a favorite bogeyman for Republican candidates. Activists such as Christopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, conceived of targeting CRT to foment a backlash against measures enacted following George Floyd's murder in May 2020. At that time, Rufo told me in an email, \"school districts across the country suddenly started adopting 'equity statements,' hiring 'diversity and inclusion' bureaucrats, and injecting heavily partisan political content into the curriculum.\" Black Lives Matter and the left were riding high, said Rufo, who denies that structural racism exists in America. In our email exchange, Rufo described \"the fight against critical race theory\" as \"the most successful counterattack against BLM as a political movement. We shifted the terrain and fought on a vector the Left could not successfully mobilize against.\"\n\nThe anti-CRT campaign quickly expanded from sloganeering to writing laws. Seven states , including Florida, have passed legislation aimed at restricting public colleges' teaching or training related to critical race theory. Those laws face impediments. On November 17, 2022, a federal judge temporarily blocked enforcement of the higher-education provisions of Florida's Individual Freedom Act. \"The First Amendment does not permit the State of Florida to muzzle its university professors, impose its own orthodoxy of viewpoints, and cast us all into the dark,\" Judge Mark Walker wrote . The DeSantis administration filed a notice of appeal on November 29, and is seeking to stay the injunction pending that appeal. The Eleventh Circuit, where most of the judges are Republican appointees, will hear the appeal, with briefs to be filed in the next few months, and oral arguments potentially this coming summer.\n\nAdditionally, with DeSantis's landslide reelection-after a campaign in which he repeatedly denounced \"woke\" education-and Republicans gaining a supermajority in both chambers of the state's legislature, they are likely to look for new ways to crack down on CRT and what they perceive as higher education's leftist tilt. And at the federal level, conservatives are drafting a \"potential suite of executive orders in 2024,\" in case the next presidential election goes their way, to \"disrupt the national network of left-wing ideological production and distribution,\" according to Rufo.\n\nIt's easy to dismiss the conservative crusade against critical race theory as political theater without real consequences. But most colleges and universities offer social-science and humanities courses that address racial inequality and systemic racism, and the anti-CRT laws are already having repercussions for people who teach or take these classes in red states. Moreover, the push against CRT is hitting academia after decades of declines in the proportion of professors protected by tenure, meaning that most faculty members are not in positions secure enough to resist political pressure. Now, forced to consider whether they face any legal or career risk, some are canceling courses or watering down content, keeping quiet rather than sharing their expertise with students.\n\n\"When you implement a law like this, you're asking professors to leave out things that clearly happen or have happened in the past,\" Grace Castelin, a UCF undergraduate who plans to introduce a resolution in the student senate condemning the law, told me. \"It's making us more ignorant in this generation and generations to come.\"\n\nF earful that legislators will retaliate by cutting their budgets, few top university administrators have publicly criticized the laws, which put institutions as well as individual teachers at risk. Indeed, UCF Provost Michael Johnson told faculty last July that the university would \"have to take disciplinary action\" against any faculty member who repeatedly violated the Individual Freedom Act, because it couldn't afford to lose a \"catastrophic amount\"-$32 million-in state funding linked to graduation rates and other metrics. (Johnson declined an interview request.)\n\nOther states have left professors similarly undefended. In Tennessee, which passed a law much like Florida's, the provost of the state university's flagship Knoxville campus made clear to professors that the administration wouldn't necessarily help them. If they were sued under the law, Provost John Zomchick told faculty, Tennessee's Republican attorney general would decide whether the university would represent them in court. \"People freaked out,\" said Anne Langendorfer, a senior lecturer at UT Knoxville and the president of a union for campus workers at the state's public universities.\n\nA university spokesperson, Kerry Gardner, said that the attorney general makes the final decision in \"any situation\" where individuals are sued in their capacity as university employees. Administrators \"wanted to be fully transparent about how the process works,\" while assuring faculty that \"we will take every step to defend them,\" Gardner said. Zomchick, she added, \"does not agree with the view of some faculty\" that the law \"infringes on the First Amendment or academic freedoms.\"\n\nWith uncertain support from above, most full and associate professors at least enjoy the protection of tenure, which shields scholars whose insights or research are politically unpopular. Tenured professors can't be fired without cause and a hearing by their peers. Other faculty typically work on contracts, which the university can decide not to renew without specifying a reason.\n\nSome tenured professors in Florida have resisted anti-CRT pressure. The historian Robert Cassanello, the president of the UCF chapter of United Faculty of Florida, was comfortable becoming a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits contending that the Individual Freedom Act violates free speech. Cassanello, who keeps a life-size cutout of Karl Marx in his office window, told me that he's less threatened by the law than his untenured colleagues are.\n\nBy contrast, Juan Salinas, an assistant sociology professor at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, declined to be a plaintiff. \"For me to stick my name out, I didn't feel comfortable,\" Salinas said. \"If I had tenure, I would be more active.\"\n\nBut even having tenure didn't feel like \"adequate protection\" to Scott Carter, the other UCF sociologist who scrapped a course on race in the fall semester. \"It's very sad for students,\" Carter told me. \"They won't get the experience of hearing from scholars on contemporary race relations.\"\n\nDavid French: Free speech for me but not for thee\n\nPerhaps the surest indication that tenure helps safeguard critical race theory and other controversial curricula is that conservatives are trying to jettison it. In 2021, Georgia's public-university system made firing tenured faculty easier. After the University of Texas's faculty council adopted a resolution last February supporting professors' right to teach critical race theory, Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick c a lled for abolishing tenure for new hires at the state's public universities. Last April, DeSantis signed a bill authorizing reviews of tenured professors every five years.\n\nThe tenure divide has a racial dimension. At many state universities, tenured faculty are overwhelmingly white. Untenured faculty are more likely to be people of color. In the fall of 2018, 7.4 percent of full professors and 10.9 percent of associate professors-the two ranks most likely to be tenured-were Black or Hispanic , compared with 11.8 percent of assistant professors and 17 percent of instructors, lecturers, and others, according to the American Association of University Professors. Women are also disproportionately concentrated in untenured positions.\n\nBesides having less job security than their tenured colleagues, many untenured faculty have less say in which courses they teach. One visiting assistant professor of sociology at an Oklahoma university, who requested anonymity to speak about her workplace, specializes in gender research; her dissertation was on urban women's experiences with menstrual practices in Kathmandu, Nepal. She wasn't familiar with critical race theory. But after Oklahoma in 2021 banned \"any orientation or requirement\" in higher education \"that presents any form of race or sex stereotyping or a bias on the basis of race and sex,\" she found herself assigned to teach a course on racial and ethnic relations.\n\n\"I have consistently seen this course taught by nontenured professors,\" she told me. \"That's been the trend,\" perhaps because of \"tenured professors not wanting to do the dirty work.\"\n\nUniversities themselves helped create the vulnerability that conservatives are exploiting, saving money-and, in the case of public institutions, offsetting budget cuts-by shifting to a less tenured teaching force. Tenured professors have declined from 39 percent of faculty in 1987, the earliest year for which comparable figures were available, to 24 percent in 2020, according to an AAUP analysis of federal data. There has been a corresponding increase in the proportion of what are known as contingent faculty, who aren't tenured or on a path to it-instructors, lecturers, teaching faculty who don't do research, and adjuncts-from 47 percent in 1987 to 67 percent in 2020. The remaining 9 percent are tenure-track faculty like Cox. Two of Florida's youngest public universities-Florida Gulf Coast University and Florida Polytechnic University, which opened in 1997 and 2014, respectively-do not currently grant tenure at all.\n\nThis past fall, Florida Gulf Coast's social-and-behavioral-sciences department offered one race-focused course, \"Race and Culture.\" The former FGCU sociologist Ted Thornhill had stirred conservative protests by teaching courses on \"Racism and Law Enforcement\" and \"White Racism,\" and by founding a Center for Critical Race and Ethnic Studies. Since Thornhill left in June 2022 for a tenure-track post in the Pacific Northwest, no one has been teaching those courses. (Another instructor is scheduled to teach \"Racism and Law Enforcement\" this summer.) The university refashioned the center to focus on \"the Study of Race, Gender, Ethnicity, and Culture,\" dropping the word critical .\n\n\"I knew it had a short life expectancy,\" Thornhill told me.\n\nFGCU President Michael Martin said that the center was renamed not to appease conservatives but to encompass groups such as Latinos, Native Americans, and Jews. Still, Martin acknowledged that academia has become \"overly politicized,\" and that Florida \"has been out in front of some of this.\"\n\nIn the past, when academic freedom was threatened, tenure proved to be one of its most effective defenses. During the McCarthy era, when tenured professors were accused of having Communist sympathies, \"their institutions had to go through the motions of a formal investigation,\" the historian Ellen Schrecker wrote in No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism & the Universities . \"Non-tenured teachers had no such rights.\" The Cornell physicist Philip Morrison, an ex-Communist who remained politically active, \"could not be quietly dropped from the faculty\" in the early 1950s, at the height of the Red Scare, because he had tenure, and he was eventually promoted to full professor.\n\nThe sociologist Shantel Buggs is hoping to become a rarity: a tenured Black woman in Florida State's College of Social Sciences and Public Policy. In 2021, the college had one tenured Black woman. Overall, it had two tenured Black faculty and 59 white faculty.\n\nThe daughter of two Marines, Buggs was the first college graduate in her family. She has won teaching awards, published book chapters and articles in refereed journals, developed new courses, and helped establish an anti-racism task force on campus. When UCF offered her a tenured associate professorship in 2021, Florida State gave her a raise to stay.\n\n\"Your work is powerful, timely, and extremely socially relevant, and you have quickly gained national recognition in your areas of expertise,\" Buggs's department chair at Florida State, Kathryn Tillman, wrote in 2021. Tillman also called her a \"fantastic teacher and mentor.\"\n\nAs the Individual Freedom legislation was being enacted, Buggs detected a subtle recalibration of her prospects. In April 2022, Buggs told me, Tillman urged her to take advantage of a COVID-19 extension and delay her candidacy for tenure by a year. Buggs protested. \"I thought it was unfair that I be asked to wait to go up for promotion in this political climate because what I teach and what I research will place a target on me,\" she said. But she agreed, she said, after Tillman expressed concern that higher-ups might deem her publication record insufficient for tenure. (Tillman told me via email that she can't comment on personnel issues.)\n\nOne course that Buggs had developed and taught was \"Critical Race Theory.\" She last offered it in the spring of 2021. The following September, she learned that it was the only Florida State course listed on the Critical Race Training in Education website, which has been featured on Tucker Carlson Tonight and describes CRT as a \"radical ideology\" that challenges \"the very foundations\" of American democracy. Buggs discovered that the website was a project of something called the Legal Insurrection Foundation.\n\nThe term insurrection alarmed her. Anxious that she might be trolled or harassed, Buggs was receptive in May 2022 to another Tillman request-to change the name of the course. Tillman told me that she and Buggs had discussed whether another title would help avoid \"potential misperceptions about the course's intent. Together, we agreed to give it a try.\" The course, which Buggs plans to teach in the upcoming semester, was relisted as \"Sociology of Race and Ethnicity.\"\n\nThe purpose of the Critical Race Training in Education website is to \"document what students can expect at a particular campus,\" according to William Jacobson, a Cornell University law professor and the president of the Legal Insurrection Foundation. Jacobson told me that, because he had criticized the Black Lives Matter movement, Cornell alumni petitioned to have him fired, a faculty statement denounced him, and a student group called for boycotting his courses. \"Considering what I have gone through, I am very sympathetic to left-leaning faculty who come under attack, but it also is clear that the overwhelming campus cancel culture is from the left towards the right, not the other way around,\" he said.\n\nA Florida State spokesperson told me critical-race-theory scholars should have no concern that their specialty will hurt their tenure chances. But Katrinell Davis, the director of the university's African American Studies program and the only tenured Black woman in the college of social sciences, says she is \"saddened\" by Buggs's predicament. \"Her trajectory as a scholar may be impacted\" by the Individual Freedom Act, \"and because of the doubts that might arise around the value of CRT,\" Davis told me.\n\nFor her part, Buggs said she is open to leaving Florida for another state where she can teach critical race theory without legal consequences, but she doesn't want to. \"I have enjoyed working here,\" she told me. \"I'm a stubborn person. I don't want to give DeSantis the satisfaction.\"\n\nBuggs also worries that the political climate is rubbing off on students. In the past year or two, Buggs said, some students have begun to \"ding\" her in evaluations as judgmental or biased. Last spring, one called her a \"misandrist\"-a man-hater. \"Part of what pissed me off is, he got an A,\" she said. She has added a disclaimer provided by the faculty union to her syllabi: \"No lesson is intended to espouse, promote, advance, inculcate, or compel a particular feeling, perception, viewpoint, or belief.\"\n\nOther untenured teachers at Florida State are tweaking their pedagogy. When the doctoral candidate Taylor Darks taught a section of Buggs's \"Race and Minority Group Relations\" course this past fall, she invited students to suggest questions for discussion-but told me that she generally weeded out queries that mentioned \"white privilege.\" And Tyler McCreary, an assistant geography professor, made what he calls a \"strategic adjustment\" in his fall 2022 honors course on environmental justice. For a class project on a pipeline in northern Canada that affects Indigenous people, McCreary told me he's been \"much more cautious of not just critiquing the development but making sure to include the company's perspective.\"\n\nMcCreary, who is up for tenure this year, has also shifted his teaching method from lecturing to class discussion. He wants to avoid complaints under another new Florida law that allows students to record professors' lectures for evidence of political bias. The law doesn't apply to class discussion, because students must consent to be recorded.\n\nP arked one October afternoon on the Florida State campus was a minibus covered in graffiti of various political persuasions. One commentator had scrawled \"Socialism Sucks,\" only to have another cross out \"Sucks\" and replace it with \"Is Sexy.\" Outside, a field rep for Turning Point USA, a conservative campus network, invited passersby to a speech by the group's founder, the talk-show host Charlie Kirk. Turning Point USA, which has spent millions of dollars through its advocacy and political arms backing Donald Trump and candidates he endorsed, has what it calls a \"watchlist\" dedicated to \"unmasking radical professors.\"\n\nThe minibus was intended to signify Kirk's opposition to censorship. But when I asked him at his talk that night in Tallahassee's civic center whether he supports laws restricting the teaching of critical race theory, he said he does, and that it's not a free-speech issue. \"It's a matter of curriculum, right?\" he said. \"Should we teach the flat-Earth theory in physics, right? Should we teach bloodletting in biology? ... There are some ideas that are so reprehensible and provably wrong, they shouldn't be anywhere close to an academic environment.\" (Kirk bridles at the very notion of systemic racism: In his talk, he referred to the aftermath of George Floyd's death as \"Floydapalooza, when we decided to destroy our entire country around a lie that America is systemically racist, which of course we're not; we're the least racist country ever to exist in the history of the world.\")\n\nIbram X. Kendi: There is no debate over critical race theory\n\nKirk's denial of systemic racism is at odds with the experience of students half a mile away, across the railroad tracks, at the public, historically Black Florida A&M University. Founded in 1887, and located since 1891 on a former plantation, FAMU has long been slighted by the state. When Nathan B. Young, the school's president from 1901 to 1923, supplemented its agricultural and vocational programs with liberal arts, state officials feared that too much learning might make Black students dissatisfied with manual labor, and dismissed him. After World War II, hoping to avoid desegregating white law schools, Florida opened a law school at FAMU. In 1966, the state prohibited FAMU from enrolling a new law-school class, and transferred funding to Florida State, which wanted its own law school. FAMU's law school reopened in 2002 in Orlando, where it wouldn't compete with Florida State's.\n\nThis past September, a group of FAMU students sued the state of Florida, accusing it of discriminating by underfunding FAMU compared with traditionally white schools. Among the disparities cited: In 2015, the state moved the almost $13 million budget for a joint FAMU-Florida State engineering college from FAMU's general operating revenues to a separate line under Florida State's authority. (A Florida State spokesperson said that presidents of both universities had agreed to the shift.) Also, the lawsuit says, linking funding to measures such as four-year graduation rates hurts FAMU and other universities that primarily serve low-income students.\n\nIn November, the state moved to dismiss the lawsuit, contending that the benchmarks used to determine funding are \"wholly neutral,\" and that the goal is to \"reward institutions who have better student outcomes,\" not to \"diminish the performance of historically black institutions.\"\n\nIn contrast to Florida State's lush, impeccably maintained campus, FAMU's shows signs of neglect, including cracked walkways and rusted pipes. Interviewed on campus, plaintiffs in the lawsuit described more indignities: beds with broken frames, a dormitory infested with rats and cockroaches, computers so old that current professors had used them when they were undergraduates.\n\nOne of those plaintiffs, FayeRachel Peterson, a first-year graduate student in chemistry, told me that some of the labs she worked in as a FAMU undergraduate lacked vital equipment. She and her classmates frequently had to finish their lab work at Florida State. \"FAMU tries its best to give us what it can with what's given to them,\" she said. \"What's given to them is less than what's given to others.\"\n\nAnother student, Nyabi Stevens, a third-year psychology major, told me that the state's treatment of FAMU illustrates the importance of discussions that the Individual Freedom Act is trying to silence. \"That's what the lawsuit is about-pointing out the systemic racism we see,\" she said. \"I came to an HBCU so I can learn about my history. I am very proud to be in the lawsuit and be a voice for people who don't have a voice.\"\n\nU CF students who wanted to learn about critical race theory this past fall had few options. Not only had the three sociology courses been canceled, but an anthropology course on racism was nixed because not enough students signed up for it.\n\nOne course that did survive has \"flown under the radar,\" Christian Ravela, an associate humanities professor, told me. His 18 students learned \"how color-blindness has become the dominant racial ideology\" and examined the anti-CRT movement, including the Individual Freedom Act, he said. Ravela received tenure in 2022. If he hadn't, \"I would have been most likely to just request to cancel the course.\"\n\nThe preliminary injunction against the Individual Freedom Act pleased untenured faculty who teach critical race theory, but it hardly allayed their concerns. \"There is still an ongoing battle,\" Jonathan Cox, the UCF professor, told me. \"It seems just as likely that if a more conservative appeals judge reviews this, they will simply reinstate the law. Regardless, DeSantis and his conservative majority in the Florida legislature will probably continue working to keep this law and others in place.\"\n\nAfter canceling his two fall courses on race, Cox has committed to teaching \"Race and Ethnicity\" in the semester that's about to begin. His wife has returned to work, so the family could get by on her income if he were to lose his job. Beyond that, he said, \"I just decided, I'm not going to run from it . This is what I teach. This is what I study. There's tremendous value in students learning about these things.\"\n\nKirsten Berg contributed research to this article."

      "text": "Democracies Don't Try to Make Everyone Agree\n\nMarxist literary scholars and popularizers of critical race theory have one thing in common with certain GOP commentators: a tendency to see their own view of the world as the only valid one.\n\nBack in the 1980s, comparative-literature majors at my university had to take a required course in literary theory. This course-Lit 130, if memory serves-offered prospective scholars a series of frames and theories that could be applied to the reading of books. This was the heyday of deconstructionism-essentially a form of highly pretentious close reading, imported from France-and so we read quite a few texts looking for things that interested deconstructionists. But we also read Freudians, Marxists, feminists, and others.\n\nWe suffered through a lot of turgid academic writing, but the class had its uses. I learned, among other things, that one can read the same text from multiple points of view and therefore see different themes in it. When a Marxist reads Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice , for example, he might become interested in the way in which wealth, power, and the determination to have both shapes the lives of all of the characters. When a feminist reads the same book, she might discover that patriarchal attitudes toward women, who are judged and valued for their marriageability, shape the lives of the characters too. The Freudians, as you might surmise, would notice a whole different set of motifs.\n\nBecause Austen herself was very interested in capitalism, patriarchy, and psychology-though she wouldn't have used any of those terms-these varied ways of reading could reveal new aspects to the story. Still, one also learned how to maintain some distance from all of the theorists, especially those who claimed unique access to truth. It was important to stay well away from bad Marxist scholars, for example, the kind who insisted that their way of reading Pride and Prejudice was the only way to read Pride and Prejudice . That attitude led to many dead ends: In the Soviet Union (where bad Marxist scholars were eventually the only scholars allowed to publish anything at all) literary scholarship, like scholarship more generally, became not just dull and boring but actually dangerous for anyone with a different point of view.\n\nRead: The GOP's 'critical race theory' obsession\n\nAt that time critical race theory, a line of scholarship that identifies ways that racism has shaped institutions, was a phenomenon confined to obscure legal journals, and we didn't read Pride and Prejudice or anything else from that perspective. But similar ideas had been floating around for decades. Famously, the critic Edward Said argued in a 1993 essay titled \"Jane Austen and Empire\" that what was not said about slavery and colonialism in Austen's novels was highly significant. Austen's father was a trustee of a sugar plantation in Antigua. That it relied on slave labor helps explain some of her family's wealth; sugar plantations also explained the wealth of some characters in her novels. And yet they rarely talk about slavery. Being aware of their silence won't help you understand why Elizabeth finally marries Mr. Darcy or why Mr. Darcy saves Lydia, and it certainly won't explain the deep appeal of Austen's novel across time and geography. If the absence of conversation about slavery is the only thing you know about Austen, then your understanding of her books will be severely impoverished. But if you are an Austen scholar, or just an Austen fan, knowing about the unmentioned sugar plantations opens up new ways of thinking about Austen and the world she inhabited. And that, in the end, is the point of scholarship.\n\nIn his congressional testimony last week , General Mark Milley endorsed the underlying philosophy of Lit 130, which also happens to be the underlying philosophy of a liberal education: Read widely; listen to everybody; make your own judgment about what's important. Here is how he put it: \"I do think it's important actually for those of us in uniform to be open-minded and be widely read.\" The phrase widely read means that you can and should read things you disagree with. You can definitely read Marx without becoming a Marxist. You can read critical race theory without becoming a \"critical race theorist,\" however you define that. Doing both will help you become an educated person-or, as in Milley's case, an educated soldier.\n\nYou can also read American history in this same spirit, the way you would read a great piece of literature, seeking to understand the complexities and the nuances, the dark and the light, the good and the bad. You can be inspired by the Declaration of Independence, horrified by the expulsions of Native Americans, amazed by the energy of immigrants and frontier settlers. You can understand that the United States is a great and unique country whose values are worth defending-and realize simultaneously that this same country has made terrible mistakes and carried out horrific crimes. Is it so difficult to hold all of these disparate ideas in your head at the same time?\n\nSoldiers should know, Milley declared, that African Americans were counted as less than fully human until \"we had a civil war and Emancipation Proclamation to change it.\" It took \"another 100 years,\" he noted, to get to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. All of that should sound completely uncontroversial. It's just a recitation of facts about American history, things that most people learn in elementary school. But to Fox News's Tucker Carlson, the mere suggestion that you should seek to understand your own society, including its flaws, makes you a \"pig\" and \"stupid.\" Laura Ingraham, another Fox News host, called for defunding the military in response to Milley's statements, on the grounds that \"he's chosen to indulge the radical whims of Democrats.\" The Carlsons, Ingrahams, and other culture warriors who now dominate the world of conservative infotainment seem now to believe that the study of American history-the knowledge of what actually happened on the territory that lies between the two shining seas-should be forbidden.\n\nThe Republican-controlled state legislatures and school boards that are currently seeking to ban the teaching of \"critical race theory\" have this same intention. Most of them seem not to have a very clear idea of what the phrase means, and so invariably the ban will be interpreted broadly and clumsily: Schoolchildren should not be taught the history of racism in America; they should not learn about slavery; they should not be allowed to think about the long-term consequences. That, apparently, is now the consensus in a segment of the Republican Party.\n\nBut there is another kind of person who might dislike Milley's attitude. Critical race theory is not the same thing as Marxism, but some of its more facile popularizers share with Marxists the deep conviction that their way of seeing the world is the only way worth seeing the world. Moreover, some have encouraged people to behave as if this were the only way of seeing the world. The structural racism that they have identified is real, just as the class divisions once identified by the Marxists were real. But racism is not everywhere, in every institution, or in every person's heart at all times. More to the point, any analysis of American history or American society that sees only structural racism will misunderstand the country, and badly. It will not be able to explain why the U.S. did in fact have an Emancipation Proclamation, a Civil Rights Act, a Black president. This is a major stumbling block, not so much for the legal scholars (some of whom actually merit the title \"critical race theorist\") but rather for the popularizers and the scholars-turned-activists who want to force everybody to recite the same mantras.\n\nClint Smith: Telling the truth about slavery is not 'indoctrination'\n\nMany people, not just General Milley, inhabit a middle ground. A few months ago I interviewed Charles Mills, a philosopher whose most famous book, The Racial Contract , published in 1997, offers an alternative reading (you could call it a critical race theorists' reading) of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Kant-the Enlightenment thinkers who, anticipating liberal democracy, all argued (to put it crudely) that a legitimate government must have the consent of the governed. Mills pointed out that all of them left Black and other nonwhite people outside of the social contract, and he sketched out the consequences. I asked him whether this meant we should no longer read Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and Kant. He told me that, on the contrary, the last class he taught was about those philosophers and their modern critics, including himself: \"To me, it's a much more fruitful way of carrying on the tradition than saying, 'These guys are racist and sexist. Therefore, stop teaching them.'\"\n\nMills told me that not all of his colleagues understand him. \"They say, 'Why are you trying to keep this tradition alive? We should jettison this whole way of doing political philosophy and basically start anew.'\" But he disagrees. \"There is a dynamism inside liberalism that they miss,\" he told me. The huge advantage of liberal democracy over other political systems is that its leadership constantly adjusts and changes, shifting to absorb new people and ideas. Liberal democracies don't try, as Soviet Marxism once did, to make everybody agree about everything, all the time.\n\nBut to maintain that flexibility, a liberal-democratic society absolutely requires that its citizens experience a liberal education, one that teaches students, scholars, readers, and voters to keep looking at books, history, society, and politics from different points of view. If one of our two great political parties no longer believes in this principle-and if some of our scholars don't either-then how much longer can we expect our democracy to last?"

      "text": "The Second Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nKing's nightmare of racism is being presented as his dream.\n\nE arly on the evening of October 23, 2019, I took a tour of the Lorraine Motel. I'd been to Memphis, Tennessee, several times before, and I'd come back to speak at the National Civil Rights Museum, which encompasses the motel. But until that October, I'd never been able to bring myself to visit the site of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination.\n\nI saw what King saw moments before he saw no more. His second-floor room had been preserved. Walking into there was like walking into 1968. I saw the antique dishes from the motel's kitchen. I saw two beds: one for King, unmade, and one for his friend Ralph Abernathy. On April 4, 1968, King had been feeling under the weather.\n\nThe night before he was killed, King addressed striking Black sanitation workers in Memphis. \"If something isn't done, and in a hurry,\" he said , \"to bring the colored peoples of the world out of their long years of poverty, their long years of hurt and neglect, the whole world is doomed.\"\n\nFrom the King issue: The whitewashing of King's assassination\n\nI walked out of Room 306, as King did, around 6 p.m. From the balcony, I looked down on a white 1959 Dodge Royal and a white 1968 Cadillac. King looked down to talk with some friends in the parking lot. He turned to walk back into his room. A bullet smashed into his neck. I stood on the concrete square where King's life fell. I looked to where King's associates pointed in the sniper's direction.\n\nI did not say anything during the tour. A guide spoke, but I couldn't hear him. My silence kept screaming in my solemnness. I would grieve in silence (and later in words).\n\nThe second assassination of King began days after the first assassination. Almost a third of Americans polled in April 1968 felt that King himself was to blame for his assassination, felt that he had \"brought it on himself.\" When King was killed, he was one of the most hated people in the United States. Nearly half of Black Americans and three-quarters of white Americans disapproved of him when he stepped out onto that motel balcony. Death threats were a fact of his life.\n\nKing's first assassins professed to hate him half a century ago. His second assassins profess to revere him. Death threats to King's legacy are now sold as love songs to his legacy. King is adored in death, literally. King is still hated in life.\n\nTake the small Ohio crowd that gathered for a political rally last month. A white woman held a sign that read EDUCATE DON'T INDOCTRINATE. Another sign said SAVE THE DIVISION FOR MATH CLASS . Another person held a large poster of King.\n\nRead: Martin Luther King Jr. saw three evils in the world\n\nJosh Mandel, a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, spoke to the crowd. \"What the liberals are doing by advancing the cause of critical race theory-they are stomping on the grave of Martin Luther King,\" said Mandel, whose internal poll shows him leading the Republican primary race.\n\n\"Martin Luther King once said that he had a dream that his grandkids would be judged not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character,\" Mandel added . \"But what you have going on in the government schools by these liberals and the media, by the secular left, by the radical left, they're trying to make everything about skin color.\"\n\nThe sniper shots aimed at King's body of work sound this way almost every time. His modern-day assassins endlessly recite King's \"dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character\"-as if that was all King said during his 1963 March on Washington speech. They disregard the lines before and after it, when King lamented that his dream was being thwarted by \"vicious racists\" in places \"sweltering with the heat of oppression.\" They disregard King's paraphrase of his iconic \"dream\" line in 1965 : that \"one day all of God's Black children will be respected like his white children.\" They disregard King's recognition that the civil-rights movement did not end racism, leading him to tell an NBC News correspondent on May 8, 1967, that the \"dream that I had [in 1963] has at many points turned into a nightmare.\" (Ironically, it was this nightmare of post -civil-rights racial inequality that caused legal scholars in the 1970s to develop critical race theory in law schools, particularly to study and reveal the law's role in the maintenance of inequality.)\n\nKing's modern-day assassins disregard everything he said about education. \"Whites, it must frankly be said, are not putting in a similar mass effort to reeducate themselves out of their racial ignorance,\" King wrote in 1967. \"It is an aspect of their sense of superiority that the white people of America believe they have so little to learn.\"\n\nThey disregard King's worry about the effects of not teaching Black history, including white people internalizing notions of superiority and Black people internalizing notions of inferiority. \"The history books, which have almost completely ignored the contribution of the Negro in American history, have only served to intensify the Negroes' sense of worthlessness and to augment the anachronistic doctrine of white supremacy,\" King wrote in 1967.\n\nBut all of this disregarding of King's words has not been the worst of it. The distortions are what's truly lethal to his legacy, such as the claim that King's dream was for his four little children to live in a nation where despite numerous racial disparities, no one judges racism or mentions skin color and everyone judges only character, because a hierarchy of character is apparently causing the inequities. King's nightmare of racism is being presented as King's dream.\n\nIbram X. Kendi: Our new postracial myth\n\nThose who distort King's dream are now also distorting critical race theory, and distorting CRT to distort King. \"Critical race theory is a Marxist doctrine that rejects the vision of Martin Luther King Jr.,\" Donald Trump said at a Michigan campaign rally last October. In July, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said , \"Critical race theory goes against everything Martin Luther King has ever told us, don't judge us by the color of our skin, and now they're embracing it.\"\n\nIt is wrong to present King, who continuously spoke out against racism, as someone who stood against people speaking out against racism. It is wrong to claim that teachers educating their students about past and present racism \"are stomping on the grave of Martin Luther King,\" to quote Mandel. But people such as Trump, McCarthy, and Mandel aren't simply stomping on King's grave themselves. These self-professed admirers of King are digging a new grave, and burying King's body of work within it.\n\nTexas state Senator Bryan Hughes said in July that he was aggrieved by educators teaching \"the inverse of what Dr. King taught us.\" But this same legislator proposed a bill weeks earlier that would have removed King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech and \"Letter From Birmingham Jail\" from the Texas state curriculum. This year, the Tennessee group Moms for Liberty attempted to ban Frances E. Ruffin's book Martin Luther King Jr. and the March on Washington . Pennsylvania's Central York School District banned Brad Meltzer's I Am Martin Luther King, Jr . Two years ago, the Columbia County School District in Georgia banned Nic Stone's Dear Martin . There's no contradiction in these elected officials and parents banning books about a historical figure they claim to adore when they adore this historical figure only now that he is dead.\n\nKing's adult children have spent the past year defending their father's legacy. In the latest instance, Bernice King invited Josh Mandel, in response to his Ohio rally speech, \"to study my father's teachings in full and in context. He was not a drum major for a colorblind society, but for justice.\"\n\n\"Spare me your lectures,\" Mandel shot back.\n\n\"I don't see liberals stomping on my father's grave,\" Martin Luther King III tweeted at Mandel. \"I see a GOP effort to whitewash history.\"\n\n\"You have no idea what you're talking about,\" Mandel tweeted .\n\nMandel then addressed both of them together on Twitter . \"You guys are just charlatans who use CRT to pervert his legacy and make money. He was a leader among leaders who brought people together and tore down racial barriers.\"\n\nW hen President Ronald Reagan marked the first federally recognized Martin Luther King Jr. Day, in January 1986, he saluted \"all those who have continued to work for brotherhood, for justice, for racial harmony-for a truly color-blind America where all people are judged by the content of their character, not the color of their skin. To them I say, never, never abandon the dream.\"\n\nReagan abandoned government efforts to eliminate racial inequities, and constantly evoked King to justify his abandonment. King, though, had been clear about how to achieve his dream. \"If we are going to make the American dream a reality, we are challenged to work in an action program to get rid of the last vestiges of segregation and discrimination,\" King said in his 1965 \"American Dream\" speech. \"This problem isn't going to solve itself.\"\n\nBut Reagan Republicans then and Trump Republicans today have disparaged these anti-racist action programs to eliminate racial disparities as \"racist,\" as \"reverse discrimination,\" as handing out \"special privileges\" or \"special treatment,\" all of which they claim King opposed.\n\n\"It is, however, important to understand that giving a man his due may often mean giving him special treatment,\" King wrote in his 1967 book, Where Do We Go From Here . \"I am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal opportunity and equal treatment of people according to their individual merits.\"\n\nFifty-four years later, this remains a troublesome concept for many Americans who declare that they adore King. \"Identity politics values people by characteristics like race, sex, and sexual orientation and holds that new times demand new rights to replace the old,\" Trump's 1776 Commission report stated in January. \"This is the opposite of King's hope that his children would 'live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.'\"\n\nRead: The first white president\n\nThe 1776 Commission tried to turn King into an advocate of \"color-blind civil rights.\" But King had already written back in 1967: \"This is a day which demands new thinking and the reevaluation of old concepts. A society that has done something special against the Negro for hundreds of years must now do something special for him, in order to equip him to compete on a just and equal basis.\"\n\nH istorians and writers have called attention again and again and again to the \"misappropriation\" of King, the misunderstanding of King, the stealing of King, the attempts to \"defang\" King, the \"watering down\" of King, the \"whitewashing\" of King by the conservators of racial inequity. As the distortions of King have intensified over the years, so too has the language denouncing them.\n\nAnd yet, the second assassination is about King and hardly about King at all. If Mandel is an avatar of the snipers, then King is an avatar of history. The second assassination of King is the latest assassination of history. The war on science, on expertise, on facts, on journalism, on democracy necessitates a concomitant war on history. And the war on history is the war on education-as history is essentially educational. If an anti-racist King can be turned into a color-blind conservator of racism, then anyone and anything from history can be assassinated. Pro-slavery Founding Fathers can be recast as having been \"against slavery.\" Racist Confederate rebels can be recast as \"not racist\" heroes deserving of monuments in town squares.\n\nAssassinating the reality of the past assassinates the reality of the present (and creates a new simulated reality). In this simulated reality, critical race theory can be warped into being like Jim Crow. Anti-American insurrectionists who attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6 can be presented as pro-American patriots. Education can be turned into indoctrination, and indoctrination can be turned into education. Teaching children that there's nothing special about their skin color can be turned into teaching children to hate their skin color. People organizing and writing against racism can be portrayed as \"race politics profiteers,\" as Mandel sadistically framed Bernice King.\n\nIt's been a year. I've raged. But rage has not been my overwhelming emotion as I've witnessed the assassinations of reality, of history, of King. I've largely felt grief, like I did at the Lorraine Motel two years ago. Grief-as I long for the wisdom of evidence and history to guide our policy decisions. Grief-as I long for King to live through his body of anti-racist words. Grief-as I realize that the assassins of his legacy will stop at nothing until those words are dead, until every trace of the dreamer of a multiracial democracy is gone.\n\nI remember leaving the Lorraine Motel's museum that night. I walked past the old cars in the parking lot to view the large historical inscription opposite King's motel room. I looked up at his motel room, and looked down at the biblical passage that reads :\n\nThey said one to another,\n\nBehold, here cometh the dreamer ...\n\nLet us slay him ...\n\nAnd we shall see what will become of his dreams."

The College Board, the nonprofit group that designs AP courses for high school seniors, recently revised a curriculum for a course in African American studies after criticism from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and others who maligned it as \"woke indoctrination.\" The new curriculum removes Black Lives Matter, slavery reparations and queer theory as required topics, and drops many major writers, including Crenshaw, from the reading list. \"Anybody who's concerned about our democracy, anyone who's concerned about authoritarianism has to wake up and pay attention to this, because this is how it happens,\" she says. Crenshaw coined the term \"intersectionality\" to study the overlapping or intersecting social identities and systems of oppression, domination or discrimination people experience.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe end today's show with pioneering legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw to talk about her work on intersectionality and critical race theory, after the College Board removed her writings from the required curriculum for its AP African American studies class. The College Board recently revised its curriculum for an Advanced Placement African American studies course and removed Black Lives Matter, slavery reparations and queer theory as required topics, while adding a section on Black conservatism. The new curriculum was released on the first day of Black History Month and came after Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis vowed to ban the AP Black studies class in Florida schools and Florida's Education Department, because, he said, the course, quote, \"lacks educational value.\" DeSantis is expected to announce his plans to run for president in the coming months. And this all comes as teachers across the country face increasing concern about what they're allowed to include in their curriculum as Republicans use the culture wars to build their brand. They're not only concerned - teachers - about being criticized, but being imprisoned.\n\nOn Friday, we spoke to two professors whose work has been removed from the new curriculum, E. Patrick Johnson and Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, who both teach at Northwestern, as well as to Harvard Kennedy School professor Khalil Gibran Muhammad. Today we're joined by another one of the banned, professor Kimberlé Crenshaw, leading scholar in the field of critical race theory; coined the term \"intersectionality\" to study the overlapping or intersecting social identities and systems of oppression, domination or discrimination people experience; executive director of the African American Policy Forum; professor of law at both UCLA and Columbia University; joining us from New York, after receiving the Winslow Medal from the Yale School of Public Health, the school's highest honor, which recognizes outstanding achievements in public health leadership, scholarship or contribution to society.\n\nCongratulations, Professor Crenshaw, on that honor.\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : Thank you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And some consider it honor now to be banned, though they're infuriated by it. And I'm wondering what your thoughts are now? To be clear, the College Board said they made this decision, to, for example, exclude your work from the required course, before DeSantis made this last statement a few weeks ago.\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : Yes, yes. Well, thank you, Amy. It's good to be back.\n\nYou know, I think that the focus of the debate so far has perhaps misdirected the conversation by discussing whether the ban - or, I would say, benching of some our work, from required text to optional text - came at the behest of Governor DeSantis. The reality is that there has been anti-woke legislation since, basically, President Trump said, \"Stand by, Proud Boys. I got something for you.\" And what he came up with was a ban on a whole range of racial justice and equity ideas and practices and policies. That got rescinded as soon as President Biden took office, but then it became a state-based strategy. At this point, upwards of 42 states have considered banning a certain set of ideas, certain set of practices and concepts, under the frame of anti-wokeness or anti- CRT . So, you know, it really doesn't matter much whether the College Board came to these decisions two weeks ago or two months ago. This conversation has been going on for nearly two years, if not more.\n\nYou don't become a billion-dollar corporation by not paying attention to the market. And the market indicators told the College Board that this new course that they were hoping to promote - and, interestingly enough, the opportunity for the course came after the George Floyd activation drove so many people in the streets, and they were demanding more information about structural racism, more information about intersectionality, more information about implicit bias. The same motivation that made people demand it also sparked a backlash and this legislation. So, of course the College Board knew about it. Of course the College Board had to take some kind of awareness. And we don't have to speculate about it. They've effectively told us that. When the course was announced this summer, some of the advocates for the course went to great pains to say that this course was not CRT . The effort was to distinguish it as much as possible. In reality, what that was signaling was a softness in the resolve to step forward with the ideas that had been associated with CRT . That is structural racism, the Movement for Black Lives, intersectionality. So, there was the opportunity, there was the motivation, and there was, ultimately, the content elimination - or, I will just say, benching - of some of these ideas. That's what we should be talking about, not when the memo went out.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Professor Crenshaw, I wanted to quote the Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson, who wrote, \"Educators must not allow the phrase 'critical race theory' to be used to blacklist scholars ... the same way the word 'communist' was used in the McCarthy era. Black history is our collective history as Americans. It must be told - in full.\" And I think it's very interesting also, in light of today, to talk about the new McCarthy era, given the House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. But your thoughts?\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : Well, I was delighted to see that someone noticed this. As you know, Amy, I've been talking about this since 2020. I've been saying that the whole anti- CRT , anti-woke approach to legislation is a very old idea. It's basically an idea that says greater attention to equity, greater attention to equality effectively amounts to reverse discrimination. It's anti-white. Now, this is a far-right talking point that wasn't often expressed in polite company for - until, effectively, Barack Obama was elected, and then President Trump, and now it's become mainstream. And the way that it has been made mainstream is by stoking fears about a set of ideas that most people couldn't tell you one thing about, except for the fact that they've been told to be afraid of these ideas, that it's taking something away from them, and they should repudiate it. That is a classic form of McCarthyism.\n\nAnd what makes it is so disturbing is the fact that people who know better, people who know this history, were willing to sit it out, to think that it was going to go away when the conversation changed, or to think that they could outrun the shadow by simply saying, \"We don't do critical race theory,\" without paying attention to what the critics said critical race theory was, what they were going after - all of these ideas, but, more importantly, Amy, they've said they're going after public education. They said they're going after universities. So, nobody can be surprised when suddenly this effort to stomp out critical race theory turns out to be an effort to make antiracism unspeakable, to make queer studies undoable, to make intersectionality - one of the most widespread concepts across the disciplines - something that college-directed students cannot take or can only take if the states allows them to. Anybody who's concerned about our democracy, anyone who's concerned about authoritarianism has to wake up and pay attention to this, because this is how it happens.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go to the Congressional Black Caucus chair, Nevada Congressman Steven Horsford, speaking after their caucus meeting at the White House Thursday with President Biden and Vice President Harris.\n\nREP . STEVEN HORSFORD : We were here, as you know, to discuss the importance of public safety, policing and justice. We are doing this in part in response to Tyre Nichols, a young man who should be alive today, a person who was a son and a father, who loved photography and skateboarding. ... We have agreement on how we will continue to work forward, both from a legislative standpoint as well as executive and community-based solutions. But the focus will always be on public safety, public safety for all communities, because we understand that it is about the culture of policing and keeping all communities safe, and all of us should be able to agree that bad policing has no place in any American city or community.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that's the Congressional Black Caucus chair, Steven Horsford, with a group of CBC congressmembers who just met with Harris and Biden. And, of course, you had Vice President Harris speaking at Tyre Nichols' funeral, where she called for the passage of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. And I think Cory Booker yesterday, one of the key people pushing that, all but conceded that's not going to happen. Maybe smaller points will happen - for example, banning chokeholds except in life-threatening situations, when, well, police claim that their lives are threatened; set federal standards for no-knock warrants; limit transfer of some military equipment to local departments. But I'm bringing all this up in relation to this because Black Lives Matter, which grew up in response to the killing of young Black men and women, is now not required in the curriculum.\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : Well, this is why we need to listen very carefully tomorrow to see if the president backs up his conversation with a clear directive to the American people that the question of police brutality is a vital concern and that efforts to promote the value of Black lives cannot be silenced and cannot be sidelined.\n\nLook, the Movement for Black Lives, the mobilization that took place in 2020 was the largest mobilization in American history. We all know that there is no chance of pushing forward any fundamental change, any kind of serious legislation to address our social problems, without an active social movement that creates frame alignment, that creates the notion that this is an important issue. What can signal that the Movement for Black Lives, that the problem of police brutality is less significant than it needs to be than taking it out as required reading in a course on African American studies?\n\nSo, it's up to the president, it's up to leadership to step into this, to reverse this faction that has basically tried to make racism unspeakable, to reverse the accommodationism that is at play when profit motives come into tension with the basic imperative of African American studies, which is to understand the condition not simply as an assortment of fun facts but as the material interests that need to be understood in order to transform this country into the multiracial democracy that it truly claims to be.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You were just referring to President Biden tomorrow night. Tuesday night, of course, he's giving a State of the Union address. Then he'll be launching a 20-state post-State of the Union blitz with his Cabinet to discuss the economic agenda. What do you think needs to be the message conveyed throughout this country right now?\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : Well, I think the message needs to be conveyed that we are about to go into a political period that is not unlike the political period in 1876, it's not unlike 1968, in which race is on the agenda, whether explicitly or implicitly. The Democrats have never really been effective, since -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We have 30 seconds.\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : - Lee Atwater made it clear that race was going to be used as a political cudgel. So, this is the opportunity to prepare Americans to support the idea behind multiracial democracy, not allow race to get into the way, and say what they stand for, once and for all.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor Kimberlé Crenshaw, we thank you so much for being with us, executive director of the African American Policy Forum, professor of law at UCLA and Columbia University.\n\nThat does it for our show.

Crenshaw has launched what she calls a \"counterterrorism offensive\" against the Republican efforts with a \"summer school\" inspired by the Freedom Summer movement of the 1960s. The school debunks the \"bothsidesism\" debate Crenshaw says is upheld by mainstream media, and highlights the importance of critical race theory in building a multiracial democracy. \"There's no daylight between the protection of our democracy and the protection of antiracism,\" says Crenshaw.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González, as we look now at a new effort to push back on conservative activists and politicians who claim Democrats are, quote, \"indoctrinating\" students with critical race theory. It comes as a new PBS Frontline -ProPublica report identified at least 14 public school workers who left their jobs last year after they were accused of teaching so-called CRT .\n\nFor more, we spend the rest of the hour with the pioneering scholar, activist Kimberlé Crenshaw, who has launched what she calls a counteroffensive against the organized campaign against critical race theory. It's a CRT Summer School, inspired by the Freedom Summer of the civil rights movement. She's professor of law at both UCLA and Columbia University and founder of the African American Policy Forum.\n\nProfessor Crenshaw, welcome back to Democracy Now! Before we talk about the summer school, well, give us a little bit of teaching here. Explain what critical race theory is and why you think it's so critical for people to understand.\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : Well, Amy, thank you for having me here.\n\nThere is critical race theory which is the academic law school course, which is the study of how race and racism have become embedded in our American institutions, law in particular. If you want to understand, for example, the current pattern of housing segregation or wealth disparity, you need to understand how the Federal Housing Act allowed for suburbs to be built without requiring them to be built in an integrated way, or you'd have to understand how banking practices discriminated against African American people and how much of that discrimination was legal. That's what we talk about in law school.\n\nBut, Amy, what became clear to us in the middle of this firestorm controversy against critical race theory is that it really wasn't about the law school course. It didn't make any sense to say, \"We don't even teach critical race theory,\" because what the assault was against was antiracism. We have to remember that this campaign began after the great reckoning that happened in the aftermath of George Floyd, when millions of people across the country took to the streets to demand racial justice. And they were talking about it outside of the typical way of imagining a prejudiced police officer. They were talking about it in terms of structures and in terms of institutions.\n\nAnd there was a need, obviously, on the part of the right to have a way to clap back, and so they rooted around and found critical race theory as the container into which they poured the entire apparatus of antiracism. So, what we're fighting now, and what some of those teachers are fighting, is the effort to silence all recognition, all conversation, all tools, all histories, all of the current consequences of our past. So that's why we decided it's time to turn CRT Summer School into a Freedom Summer for all stakeholders, not only stakeholders for antiracism, but stakeholders for our multiracial democracy.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Kimberlé Crenshaw, it seems to me that this is only the latest manifestation of an ongoing debate and battle that has been raging in America for decades. I think back to the 1990s, when - I think it was in 1991 that Arthur Schlesinger, the celebrated liberal historian, wrote the polemic, The Disuniting of America , and he at that time claimed that there were right-wing monoculturalists and there were left-wing multiculturalists, and both of them were interpreting American history in a one-dimensional or one-sided manner. But Schlesinger kept insisting America was created by Anglo-Saxons and Europeans, and that's the culture, and that's the history, and those are the institutions of American society. Is this phase that we're - do you see any difference between the battles that are occurring now and those that occurred in the 1990s over this issue?\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : Not really. I mean, one of my first articles was \"Race, Reform, and Retrenchment.\" And in that article, I argued that periods of reform, of mass mobilization, of significant change towards the democracy that we claim to want to be, inevitably spark backlash. They spark grievances. They spark the sense of loss. And often that sense of loss is what the energy is that drives some of the most aggressive assaults on our democracy. I mean, that's what we saw in January 6th. If nothing else, last week's hearing on the Capitol riots should reinforce the sense that this belief that something is being taken away from those who have the exclusive right to own it - namely, this democracy - is in fact part of the legacy of white supremacy that critical race theory tries to unpack.\n\nHere's the challenging thing, though. The challenging thing is, this bothsidesism that you mentioned and that has been part of the pushback consistently against knowledge and school practices that really takes seriously our claims to be a multiracial democracy, that has been, frankly, a liberal response to something that is not symmetrical. The attack on the Capitol, which everyone should have been talking about last year, was marginalized by the attack on critical race theory. And when media talked about it, media didn't talk about: What does critical race theory help us understand about why our democracy is in crisis? What they asked about is: What is happening in the classroom? What is it that critical race theory is doing to assault our children? If we had a critical race theory lens, we would know that's always been the response to antiracism. We would know that children have always been framed as being harmed by integration. And that was a projection of their parents, who don't want to have these conversations and don't want to open up their sense of entitlement about who this country is for.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And you mentioned the CRT Summer School. How can someone participate? How does it tie into the midterm elections happening this fall?\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : Well, Juan, you know, one of the things that happened when the assault on critical race theory really went into overdrive - and I have to say, it happened immediately after the Capitol riots - we found that while the Moms of Liberty and some of these other organizations were able to really galvanize parents, even people who didn't have kids in the schools, to go running to their school boards, the stakeholders for antiracism and democracy were confused. They didn't know what critical race theory was. They were told a lot of misinformation.\n\nSo we realized we need to go and reintroduce critical race theory to people as the thing they practice every day. When they give their kids the talk, when they put their hands on the steering wheel at 10:00 and 2:00 when they see police lights in their rearview mirror, they are practicing critical race theory. They are practicing the wisdom that our parents passed to us to navigate this world as people of color. So we decided we need to take it back to the community and create a summer school that brings together 160 instructors, 22 channels, five plenaries and over 110 courses. And their parents can learn what is actually happening in schools. Teachers like Matthew Hawn, who was fired for teaching an essay by Ta-Nehisi Coates, will teach the class that got him fired, so people can see what is really at stake. We have Nina Turner. We have Marc Lamont Hill talking about how the media, mainstream media, have sometimes enabled these moral panics. We have Barbara Arnwine talking about vote suppression.\n\nSo, if you want to find out more about critical race theory and why it is important to realize there's no daylight between the protection of our democracy and the protection of antiracism, then you can find out about it at www.aapf.org/crtsummerschool . There are scholarships. So, anyone who wants to be there will not be turned away for lack of resources.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And that is AAPF stands for African American Policy Forum. But I'm really struck, Professor Crenshaw, about what you're saying, the - talking about all of this as the investigation goes on on what happened on January 6th. The number of groups involved who were white supremacist is often lost, in trying to overturn the election. And you couple that with the kind of gerrymandering that's going on around the country and the kind of voter suppression. If you can talk more about how it is that we haven't come to look at this insurrection that took place - the final public hearing, before the next one, will be Thursday night - through a critical race theory lens? And you don't even have to look at it through a critical race theory lens. It's just the absolute - one of the predominant aspects of this is that so many of the people in Washington that violently entered the Capitol and attacked it were white supremacists.\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : Absolutely. And, Amy, that is critical race theory, understanding the history that led to this moment. So, it includes the fact that we've had political coups before. That's what the end of Reconstruction was. It was a violent takeover of Southern governments, fueled by this idea of grievance, fueled by this idea that people of color, Black people, have no right to determine our political future, no contribution to where we're going.\n\nBut here's the rub. It's not just the mobilization of the right wing, but the silence about it, the inability to talk about it. I mean, we have seen for months that Confederate flag and the gallows and the noose, but mainstream media had a hard time actually saying we have a white supremacist problem, partly because we've not talked critically about race for the last several decades. So, here you have a moment where the weakness, the lack of framing, the inability to call out racism and to analyze it has actually brought our democracy to the brink. We cannot afford colorblindness in talking about the most significant threat to our democracy that we've seen in our lifetimes.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you talk about the money behind the attacks on critical race theory, these parents showing up at school board meetings? Are these spontaneous developments in various neighborhoods, or is this part of a well-orchestrated and well-oiled campaign?\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : So, another moment where the mainstream media is not reporting the story. They're just doing the both-sides thing. In fact, Moms for Liberty, these parent groups, they are basically warmed-over fronts of preexisting right-wing organizations. But people are not covering it. They don't know it. So it allows them to be seen as grassroots, when in fact they are not. What is not being covered is -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We have 10 seconds.\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : - the responses of parents, who realize that this attack on history is an attack on their children's future. And that's what we're going to be talking about in CRT Summer School.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And people can still sign up even though it's this week?\n\nKIMBERLÉ CRENSHAW : They can sign up, and it will be on demand until Labor Day.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We have to leave it there. Thank you so much, Kimberlé Crenshaw, professor of law at UCLA and Columbia. I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.

North Dakota's Republican Governor Doug Burgum signed legislation banning the teaching of critical race theory, defining it as any suggestion that racism is systemically embedded in American society. The law prohibits even discussion of the law in state schools. Critics say the ban also endangers honest narratives of slavery, redlining and the civil rights movement. \"What we are witnessing are efforts on the part of the forces of white supremacy to regain a control which they more or less had in the past,\" says Davis.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe turn now to look at two education stories and how right-wing forces are trying to prevent students from learning about the climate emergency, as well as the racist history of the United States. North Dakota's Republican Governor Doug Burgum recently signed legislation banning the teaching of critical race theory. Public schools are now barred from teaching students that, quote, \"racism is systemically embedded in American society.\" Critics say the law could ban the teaching of slavery, redlining and the civil rights movement. Even discussion of the law is now prohibited in North Dakota schools.\n\nWell, on Thursday, I spoke with the legendary academic, scholar, activist Angela Davis and asked her about what was happening in North Dakota and other states across the country.\n\nANGELA DAVIS : I think that what we are witnessing at this moment is a profound clash between forces of the past and forces of the future. The campaign against teaching critical race theory in schools - now, first of all, critical race theory is not taught in high schools. And I wish more critical race theory were taught at the university level. But critical race theory has become a watchword for any conversations about racism, any effort to engage in the education of students in our schools about the history of this country and of the Americas and of the planet. Any discussions about slavery as the foundational element of this country are being barred, according to the proponents of removing, quote, \"critical race theory\" from the schools.\n\nBut let's not be misled by the term they are using. What we are witnessing are efforts on the part of the forces of white supremacy to regain a control which they more or less had in the past. So, I think that it is absolutely essential to engage in the kinds of efforts to prevent them from consolidating a victory in the realm of education. And, of course, those of us who are active in the abolitionist movement see education as central to the process of dismantling the prison, as central to the process of imagining new forms of safety and security that can supplant the violence of the police.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's the scholar and activist Angela Davis speaking Thursday. Well, on the evening of December 7th, we hope you will join us with Angela Davis and many others for a virtual celebration to mark Democracy Now! 's 25th anniversary.

The non sequiturs create a distraction for \"a woman who is overqualified for this position,\" Hoag adds. Hoag is a former federal public defender and also discusses the significance of Jackson's background as a federal public defender.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : As we continue to look at day two of Senate hearings for Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson, who will make history if she becomes the first Black woman and first public defender to serve on the nation's highest court, on Tuesday, Judge Jackson rejected Republican accusations that her sentences in child sexual abuse cases were lenient, saying she ordered, quote, \"strict sentences and all of the additional restraints available in the law.\" Republicans went after Judge Jackson on a number of issues that have become flashpoints for the right.\n\nRepublican Senator Marsha Blackburn was accused of racism after she used her opening statement to attack Judge Jackson Monday and asked if she had a, quote, \"personal hidden agenda\" to incorporate critical race theory into the legal system. On Tuesday, Blackburn moved to ask Jackson about a brief she co-signed in 2001 that described anti-abortion demonstrators as a \"hostile, noisy crowd.\" This is part of their exchange.\n\nSEN . MARSHA BLACKBURN : Let me ask you this: When you go to church, and knowing there are pro-life women there, do you look at them thinking of them in that way, that they are noisy, hostile, in your face? Do you think of them? Do you think of pro-life women like me that way?\n\nJUDGE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON : Senator, that was a statement in a brief made -\n\nSEN . MARSHA BLACKBURN : OK.\n\nJUDGE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON : - in argument for my client. It's not the way that I think of or characterize people.\n\nSEN . MARSHA BLACKBURN : OK, all right. Thank you for the clarification on that, because I think even zealous advocacy doesn't allow that type of rhetoric on a free speech issue.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Earlier in the day, Republican Senator Ted Cruz tried to tie Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to critical race theory. He asked about her role as a member of the board of trustees at the Georgetown Day School listing books in the school's curriculum, as he waved them in the air.\n\nSEN . TED CRUZ : They include How to Be an Antiracist by Ibram Kendi. They include literally stacks and stacks of books. And I'll tell you two of the ones that were most stunning. They include a book called Antiracist Baby by Ibram Kendi, and there are portions of this book that I find really quite remarkable. One portion of the book says, \"Babies are taught to be racist or antiracist. There is no neutrality.\" Another portion of the book, they recommend the babies confess when being racist. Now, this is a book that is taught at Georgetown Day School to students in pre-K through second grade, so 4 through 7 years old. Do you agree with this book that is being taught with kids that babies are racist?\n\nJUDGE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON : Senator, I do not believe that any child should be made to feel as though they are racist or though they are not valued or though they are less than, that they are victims, that they are oppressors. I don't believe in any of that. But what I will say is that when you asked me whether or not this was taught in schools, critical race theory, my understanding is that critical race theory as an academic theory is taught in law schools.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In response to this exchange, author Ibram X. Kendi tweeted, quote, \"You know Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson has impeccable credentials-and you know you're doing the work-when @tedcruz questions her about your books since he can't touch her record.\"\n\nFor more, we're joined by Alexis Hoag, professor of law at Brooklyn Law School.\n\nWelcome to Democracy Now! Before we start in on all of this - and we'd like you to weigh in - this issue of her being a public defender, so that people can examine every case. It's highly unusual for judges, let alone Supreme Court justices, to have a past where they were a public defender. Can you talk about the significance of this?\n\nALEXIS HOAG : Great, yeah. Good morning, Amy, and thank you for having me. I, too, served as an assistant federal public defender in an appellate unit, before I transitioned into academia. And I, too, am proud of my experience.\n\nAnd the federal public defender program in which Judge Jackson worked - ironically, for only two years of over a 20-year legal career - it is part of the federal judiciary. So she would have been an employee of the federal court system. And a federal public defender, any public defender, is there to uphold the constitutional rights of this country and of individual defendants. And I'm speaking primarily, although not exclusively, of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel. And our adversarial system of justice, which is a hallmark of the American legal system, depends on the fact that you have two parties that are well represented: One is the government, the prosecution; the other is the individual defendant. And so, our system of justice does not function unless you have capable, effective counsel representing people who have been accused of crimes.\n\nAnd having that kind of experience has been something that, until President Biden began to prioritize it in judicial nominees, has been a disfavored professional experience. And so, I am excited at the fact, and I think we should all be in this country excited and proud of the fact, that someone with her rich, diverse experience representing people accused of crimes is now a nominee for the highest court. And we have lacked that experience since Justice Thurgood Marshall left the bench in '91. He was the last person who had regularly represented people who were accused of crimes, although not as a public defender but as an attorney at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.\n\nAnd there, I also spent time working there, before teaching, as a senior counsel. And at LDF , there's a strategic goal to help dismantle racial inequality. And so, in Thurgood Marshall's representation of people accused of crimes, it was to advance that goal and that interest. So, at LDF , he would pick and choose which clients to represent. And I just want to underscore the fact that Judge Jackson, as a federal public defender, could not and did not choose which clients to represent. She was responsible for representing whatever client in that jurisdiction was assigned to her office and then assigned to her as a member of the federal defenders.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Alexis Hoag, what were some of the moments that stuck out to you from yesterday's hearing?\n\nALEXIS HOAG : Good morning, Juan. Several moments stuck out to me from yesterday's hearing. Just in the exchange that you played with Senator Cruz, I felt that sigh in my bones. And what we're seeing here is a supremely, in many ways, overqualified candidate for this role having to navigate, at times with a little bit of exasperation, distractions. So, she's not actually being asked about her qualifications and experience to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court when Ted Cruz asks her about children's books that are available at a private school. And she has continually reminded Senator Cruz and other senators that, as a judge, she doesn't deploy or engage with critical race theory. She's had to tell senators that she's not a biologist, she can't define what a woman is for them. She has a clear methodology as a judge, which is to review briefs, identify relevant law, apply the law to the facts, and then come up with a conclusion. And so, all of this distraction, the political grandstanding, is in many ways disrespectful.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And assuming she is confirmed, she would become one of three, quote, \"liberal\" justices on the Supreme Court, all of them women, with Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor. Your expectation of what she would bring to the court even as a member of sort of the court minority?\n\nALEXIS HOAG : Yeah, so I'm hopeful that Judge Jackson, in the context of the Supreme Court, would also be able to convince perhaps others on the court to side with sort of a liberal wing of the court. So, Chief Justice Roberts is quite concerned with the legitimacy of the court as an institution. And we have seen in some of his rulings a desire for consensus or to not necessarily vote on clear ideological lines. And so my hope is that Judge Jackson can convince Chief Justice Roberts and others from the right to join her and Justice Kagan and Sotomayor as they thoughtfully navigate some of these issues that are coming before the court. So I'm hopeful that given her diverse experiences, professionally and personally, that she's able to be someone who can convince others to join her, Kagan and Sotomayor on some of the very important personal individual rights issues that come before the court.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to ask you about the first day of Judge Jackson's confirmation hearing, when Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn accused her of praising The 1619 Project, The New York Times collection of essays that seeks to, quote, \"reframe the country's history by placing the consequences of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans at the very center of our national narrative.\" This is Senator Blackburn.\n\nSEN . MARSHA BLACKBURN : You have praised The 1619 Project, which argues the U.S. is a fundamentally racist country. And you have made clear that you believe judges must consider critical race theory when deciding how to sentence criminal defendants. Is it your personal hidden agenda to incorporate critical race theory into our legal system?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Alexis Hoag, if you could respond? Also, the Republican Party itself, the GOP tweet that shows the Jackson initials, KBJ , crossed out and replaced with the acronym CRT , as well as the link to a list of important questions for KBJ , if you can talk about this?\n\nALEXIS HOAG : Sure. So, critical race theory has become a flashpoint for the Republican Party. And most people outside of legal academia had not heard of critical race theory, or CRT , before Trump inserted it into an executive order just a few years ago. And then it started to pop up frequently on late-night Republican sort of right-wing talk shows, radio programs.\n\nBut critical race theory is really a theoretical framework that was developed by law students and law professors in the early '80s, and it stemmed from critical legal studies. And it was a way that people who were engaged in the study of law could help make sense of why the civil rights movement wasn't delivering racial equality coming out of the 1960s. I had the good fortune of studying with Derrick Bell, professor Derrick  Bell, who passed away a little over 10 years ago, but he was seen as one of the intellectual founders of CRT .\n\nAnd so, the fact that now it has been whittled down to really a rallying cry for the right to somehow characterize a discussion about racism or a way in which structural racism operates in this society has really divorced it from its true meaning and its true context. And so, when Senator Blackburn, Marsha Blackburn from Tennessee, uses CRT , it's really to tailor a message to the right-wing base. And they're using it as a rallying cry, a fundraising tool, and it's completely divorced from its actual meaning and the way that it operates.\n\nAnd when asking Judge Jackson about The 1619 Project, I believe her words were that it was \"provocative.\" And so, this idea that somehow she would use The 1619 Project in her judicial rulings is just a disingenuous characterization. And that's what we're routinely seeing, and I know we'll continue to see on day three of the hearings, is that the Republicans are mischaracterizing, misquoting, taking out of context words and speeches that Judge Jackson has made, and then we find that the Democrats are then being put on the defensive, having to correct the record, giving Judge Jackson an opportunity to explain herself in a very sort of defensive mode. And this is all a distraction, again, from a woman who is overqualified for this position.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Alexis Hoag, we want to thank you for being with us. I want to let our viewers and listeners know, Democracy Now! is live-streaming these hearings from 9 a.m. Eastern time. Yesterday's went for more than 13 hours. And we'll do it again today. Alexis Hoag, professor of law at Brooklyn Law School, former federal public defender.\n\nWhen we come back, we look at the latest with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

      "text": "I'm A Black Mom. Here's What White Parents Need To Understand About Critical Race Theory.\n\nGuest Writer\n\nTwelve years ago, I helped create the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice (DEIJ) Committee for one of our nation's most prestigious independent schools. At the time, I had no training or background in that sort of work. I was just a Black mom whose two Black sons had never read a school-assigned book in which people who looked like them weren't the \"magical negro\" trope or in chains (or athletes, servants or criminals).\n\nOur committee sent out a survey to take the school's temperature, asking people questions about the school's current DEIJ practices. From the amount of repudiation the survey received, you might have thought we were pushing student heroin use or advocating for our school to become an \"open carry\" campus.\n\nI was both shocked and wounded when I learned that some of these sweet moms who had invited me into their homes and showed up for my kids' birthday parties were so vehemently against even the idea of expanding our curriculum. This, for me, translated to, \"While we do like you and your family, Black lives don't really matter when the academic futures of our white students are at stake.\"\n\nThere is a great deal of confusion surrounding critical race theory (CRT), which is being hotly debated among the constituents of our nation's independent schools.\n\nI scrambled to educate myself about it, and as far as I can tell, critical race theory is simply the concept that racism is something embedded in our legal systems and policies. This means that CRT in the classroom teaches that racism is part of everyday life, so people, even well-intentioned white people, can nevertheless make choices that fuel racism.\n\nHallelujah, someone finally said it out loud.\n\nBut the problem with critical race theory is that it has a reputation of pitting people of color against white people. Folks think that studying a less Eurocentric curriculum will ultimately harm all students, including the Black ones, as it might hurt their chances of competing at the highest academic levels for those rare college spots.\n\nLast week, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) tried to score points by grilling Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about teaching critical race theory in the U.S. military. Milley responded, \"What's wrong with having some understanding about the country that we are here to defend?\"\n\nWhat indeed?\n\nBut like so many of America's elite schools, ours too is a business. And at the board level, there are always lively discussions about how to grow, evolve and keep up with the times without sacrificing the tuition dollars that keep us going.\n\nWill donors turn away if we swap out \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" for a book by a Black American author? Would parents enroll their kids somewhere else if we offer \"The 1619 Project\" in the lower school?\n\nOur fiduciary responsibility is to consider everything before changing anything. And we're not alone. Private schools across the country, such as Brentwood and Harvard-Westlake in Los Angeles, and Dalton in New York City, are grappling with how to keep their white full-tuition-paying families happy while honoring the history and experience of their marginalized students and faculty. And I am dismayed ― no, pissed ― to learn that in addition to CRT, there is a term invented by Black people that has been weaponized against us.\n\nCancel culture.\n\nAccording to a 2017 editorial in the Sunday New York Times, there are three main pathways by which social movements gain power: cultural, disruptive and organizational. Disruption manifests in our society as sit-ins, boycotts, protests and the like ― anything that threatens the cost of doing business as usual. Disruptors make it their mission to draw attention to the inequities that we Black people and other marginalized groups face in our country daily, by targeting people's pocketbooks.\n\nIn this way, we who have been disempowered can reclaim our power by saying, \"You will no longer be getting my attention, my money or my vote,\" sending the message to the oppressors that we are mad as hell and we aren't going to take it anymore.\n\nThe term \"cancel culture\" originated in the 1991 film \"New Jack City\" (\"Cancel that b*tch, I'll buy you a new one\") and a 2014 episode of \"Love and Hip-Hop\" titled \"You're Canceled.\" At the National Republican Convention last year, one delegate described cancel culture as something that the \"left\" created to erase our history and encourage lawlessness.\n\nReally? Shall we talk about erasing history?\n\nWhile in school, I learned that Columbus \"discovered' all these people when he arrived here and that those so-called \"Indians\" welcomed the Pilgrims with a Thanksgiving feast. It wasn't until I was an adult that I learned the truth about the atrocities committed by European invaders against the original occupants of this land. I wept when I understood how they'd been killed, pillaged, raped and stripped of their lands and dignity. And I blamed myself for not learning it earlier.\n\nDid I miss this in school? Was this taught during a week that I was sick or not paying attention?\n\nThe same feelings of inadequacy came up again when I watched HBO's \"Watchmen,\" starring Regina King, a series that opens with a graphic depiction of what is commonly known now as the Tulsa Race Massacre. When I looked it up the next day and found that it was based on the indiscriminate slaughtering of Black people, children and adults alike, in Oklahoma in 1921, I was furious.\n\nOK, I see a pattern here.\n\nWhen my older son was in middle school, his eyes would glaze over while we read chapters about the founding monarchs of Prussia, Russia and England. At some point, I flipped to the end of the book, looking for the chapters about the great kings and queens of Mali or the Inca and Maya dynasties. And what of ancient North America? Isn't it odd that we learn all about other nations' great geological discoveries? Yet when it comes to our own, it all amounts to a pile of arrowheads and primitive drawings? And wasn't our culture canceled by white historians and academics because to tell the real story would make white people feel bad about themselves?\n\nCancel culture has somehow become the new rallying cry for the right. They say that is the left's way of punishing anyone they disagree with, mocking them for canceling everything from Dr. Suess to the Fourth of July. But as my friend Beverly says, \"Consider the nefarious actions of the folks who deliberately and decidedly canceled the culture of their fellow Americans. While we might hurt your wallet, you can't accuse us of erasing an entire culture from existence.\"\n\nWhite parents and students alike have long balked at or rolled their eyes at Martin Luther King Day celebrations and wondered if obligatory commemorations like Black History Month were a waste of time. Surprisingly, I agreed with them on that point. Black History Month had devolved into a series of days filled with \"Black\" food and fabrics, culminating in the inevitable all-school \"I Have a Dream\" assembly.\n\nSo, yes, I'd like to see Harper Lee or Mark Twain replaced with Ishmael Beah and James Baldwin. I want my kids to know more than just George Washington Carver, Rosa Parks and MLK. I say that we need to teach critical race theory in school so that everyone can understand that the system to which we all subscribe and in which we live is rigged against marginalized folks. We all need to ensure that the culture of a people can never be canceled again.\n\nDo you have a compelling personal story you'd like to see published on HuffPost?

      "text": "Critical Race Theory Will Continue To Be Attacked - So Read These 8 Empowering Books By Black Authors\n\nContributing Writer\n\nBlack storytellers have historically been our balm and compass, given their ability to help us make sense of the world on a macro level while ensuring we remain conscious of critical elements within our community. As we approach 2025, critical race theory will continue to be attacked, and young peoples' access to pivotal books about the evolution of Black identity will be threatened.\n\nAnd so, reading these books is a powerful tool for resistance. Amid some solid literature that dropped this year are a few authors who were exceptional at helping us cope, illuminating new paths to understanding ourselves and making sense of the world we experience. Some of these books are critically acclaimed bestsellers. However, the criteria for my list encompass more than accolades from boards comprised of people who don't have the lived experience to validate work meant to entertain and liberate generations of Black people.\n\nAnd though they all came out in 2024, these eight books are timeless. From romance to history, fiction and nonfiction, and in no particular order, they stood out because they center elements of Black history and culture that often go unexplored in an engaging and digestible way. They help readers view the world differently, offer bold and innovative storytelling, and were written from a place of deep empathy - and they managed to speak to a specific need in the Black community\n\nWith profound empathy, care, and nuance, journalist Antonia Hylton unpacks the history of Crownsville Hospital, a psychiatric hospital in Maryland that provided care for Black patients from 1911 to 2004 (it was desegregated in the '60s). Throughout this exploration, Hylton amplified America's long history of abusing Black bodies while simultaneously failing to care for Black minds.\n\nThis work from D. Danyelle Thomas is a genre-blending, unflinching rebuke of the influences of white supremacy in the Black church. Thomas uses memoir, critical analysis and theology to offer a clear-eyed analysis of what freedom in the context of spirituality can look like for Black people.\n\nAuthor Deesha Dyer, who was social secretary in the Obama administration, shares her journey from community college to the White House. Dyer shares stories ― inspiring, raw and captivating ― about accompanying President Barack Obama on life-changing trips while secretly contending with imposter syndrome. Readers will walk away comforted by the unexpected familiarity of her story ― and with tools for how to see ourselves as capable and deserving.\n\nTamela Gordon's book is highly recommended reading for any Black woman with a thirst for realistic self-care that goes far deeper than a spa day. With grace, unmistakable love for her community and a clear understanding of the transformative power of being there for each other, Gordon offers a blueprint for how to create a solid support system.\n\nThis book burst on the scene at the top of the year and set the Black romance genre on fire. In this captivating and thoughtfully crafted story by Shameka S. Erby, she pushes back against a one-size-fits-all approach to romantic partnerships and Black love by creating complex and relatable characters in a fulfilling and healthy polyamorous relationship.\n\nPhilip V. McHarris, a Yale alum and professor of Black studies at the University of Rochester, used meticulous research and precise analysis to present a compelling argument for a country without policing. His work breathes hope into the possibility of community-based alternatives for crime and is an essential resource for anyone bold enough to reimagine what justice in America can entail.\n\nJenn M. Jackson's love letter to Black women brings the contributions of Black feminists to the forefront of history. Readers will find hope, joy and a path forward, even in the darkest times, etched within the stories and analysis Jackson bestows us with.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "'Critical Race Theory'? Here's What Teachers Say They're Actually Teaching\n\nSenior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost\n\nCritical race theory has, seemingly out of nowhere, become a hotbed issue ― at school board meetings , in conservative politicians' speeches and in media outlets, predominantly Fox News .\n\nIn April, May and June, \"critical race theory\" was mentioned a whopping 1,640 times on the conservative cable news outlet. During that same period, the phrase was mentioned just 250 times on CNN and 264 times on MSNBC , according to some number-crunching from The Washington Post .\n\nSo what is it, exactly? Largely taught in law and graduate schools , critical race theory (CRT) is an academic framework that examines how policies and the law perpetuate systemic racism. Critical race theorists posit that racism is not just the product of individual bias, but deeply embedded in our legal systems and policies.\n\nIn the last year or so, the idea that \"critical race theory\" is being taught in K-12 schools has been pushed to forefront by, among others, Chris Rufo, a conservative activist who came to prominence in the wake of George Floyd's murder and a national reckoning about racism that made \"white privilege,\" \"white supremacy\" and \"systemic racism\" everyday language.\n\nAs Rufo and similarly minded ideologues claim, kids across the nation are being indoctrinated to believe that to be white in America is to be fundamentally racist.\n\nOf course, teachers and school administrators being targeted at school board meetings have largely insisted that they aren't teaching critical race theory . Instead, many educators have argued that conservative activists are weaponizing the legal scholarship term, using the trumped-up charge as a convenient way to ban diversity and equity initiatives among school staff and curtail teachings on race and U.S. history that they find too progressive. (Indeed; Rufo has made no secret of his hopes to turn CRT into the latest conservative boogeyman to stoke fears and motivate the right.)\n\nThanks in no small part to wall-to-wall Fox News coverage, Rufo's rage against critical race theory has been an incredibly effective campaign so far. School may be out for the summer, but school board meetings are still in session and packed full of parents speaking out against CRT. As of early July, six states have passed laws that seek to ban instruction on \"critical race theory\" in K-12 schools, though these laws rarely mention critical race theory by name.\n\nMany educators are fearful that concern over critical race theory ― however far afield it may be from the actual academic definition of CRT ― might be used by parents to protest lessons on anything remotely related to racism, equality or even works by BIPOC authors.\n\nAfter an exhausting year of remote or hybrid education, many K-12 instructors say they're being unfairly maligned for what amounts to teaching honest American history . Death threats , firings and harassment are some of the consequences educators are facing across the country.\n\nAnd yet teachers ― the folks that are dealing with the lion's share of criticism as \"indoctrinators\" or worse ― have been sorely missing in this conversation. With that in mind, we recently spoke to educators across the country and asked them a few simple questions: \"Are you teaching CRT in your classroom? If not, what do you teach about race in your classroom?\"\n\nHere's what they had to say, in their own words. (Note: Some teachers asked to use their first name only, for the sake of their privacy and safety. A number of them work in districts where CRT is a contentious issue.)\n\nResponses have been edited for style and clarity.\n\nI'm a high school history, economics and civics teacher in Baldwin County, Georgia. I like to say to my students that I teach history without blinders. That means, for all parties, we look at their successes and failures and judge them accordingly. A level of nuance is required to really get the most out of an AP U.S. or world history class. The full story of our country is remarkable and devastating. Yet, when approached in its entirety, can be hopeful. The best things about this country is what it can be. And it is my students who can shape it in their image.\n\nI teach my state's standards covering the entire breadth of American history. I do take special care to spend some time on aspects that our standards do not do a good job addressing, including native societies, Black culture, immigration, and the role of Black men and women in the founding and sustaining of our nation.\n\nMy class is discussion-based and student-interest driven. For instance, when something happens in the world (say the Capitol being attacked, an election, or a topic comes to the forefront like police brutality), we read what the research says, bring all the opinions to the table, consider the historical imperatives and I let the students' opinions fall where they want to. The Second Amendment is a big deal here in the South, so we spend a lot of time on the history of it and questioning the popular narratives that surround that issue.\n\nI am a white, male teacher and my students are primarily Black. Race is not a subject we shy away from. For my white students or students of other races and ethnicities, they are free to participate in whatever way they are comfortable. I spend a lot of time demonstrating how much we have in common. There is no need for racial guilt of any kind. I am open with my recently found knowledge that my family owned slaves and might be related to Robert E. Lee. I do this to show that the distant past does not have to define you, unless you let it. But not having an awareness of where you came from makes it impossible for you to change for the better. ― Zach Balkcom, a high school teacher in Baldwin County, Georgia\n\nI'm a second grade teacher in Texas. We teach content that is required by the Texas Education Agency. These standards are called the TEKS . We do not even begin to touch on any of the tenets of CRT. However, I am able to incorporate diversity and a celebration of BIPOC culture and achievements while also adhering to state standards.\n\nFor example, one of our standards is for students to identify important historical figures and explain how their contribution has impacted the community. We research and discuss leaders such as Thurgood Marshall, Irma Rangel, W.E.B Du Bois, Cesar Chavez and Ellen Ochoa. I also incorporate books by BIPOC authors when covering our reading standards; even though my district is predominantly white, it's incredibly important to promote representation and recognize the work of BIPOC.\n\nThere have been many times in my career when we have covered Black History Month, MLK Day or Abraham Lincoln and conversations with students have organically turned to equality and civil rights. These conversations are always age-appropriate, but if students ask why Black people had to sit at the back of the bus, are we expected to just ignore it? As teachers, it is our job to help turn these little humans into compassionate, responsible, respectful global citizens. Part of that is recognizing the injustices in our past and emphasizing that we all are valuable and important as individuals.\n\nTeachers are professionals, regardless of what many of our detractors claim. We are completely capable of having age-appropriate, school-appropriate conversations about race and equality. Moreover, in the public school system, we are hard-pressed for time to effectively cover our required curriculum. It's laughable to think we have time to indoctrinate our students. Teachers are no different from every other profession in that there are always some bad apples, but overwhelmingly, teachers are not the villains we are being made out to be. We have literally dedicated our lives to their children, for very little money, and the way we are being treated is heartbreaking and insulting. ― Brittany Norton, a second-grade teacher in Texas\n\nI teach high school English in a very conservative district in Placer County in California, where there have been very heated board meetings . I can tell you, I have never used the words critical race theory in my classroom. My class focuses around the essential question: How does society influence the individual, or how does society influence an individual's identity?\n\nOne of our core texts is \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee. We analyze all the perspectives in that book. Scout, the innocent white girl watching as her father defends a Black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. The way Scout internalizes society's racism and her confusion about this. How she is treated at school and in her community because of her father. We look at Atticus and his choice to defend Tom Robinson knowing it is futile in a society that condemns Black people solely based on color. We look at Mayela, a lonely white woman who accuses Tom of rape. And of course, we look at Tom Robinson.\n\nThe primary goal of my English class is to teach kids to critically read, write, and think. Look at the text. Any text: novels, articles, ads, social media, commercials. Identify what the argument is, how that argument is being formulated, and decide for themselves whether they agree or disagree and be able to communicate why. We look at speeches from former President Donald Trump and speeches from former President Barack Obama . What is the argument? How are they trying to convince you? And are you convinced, why or why not? What does the author or speaker want us to know and what do they want us to believe? ― Tracy, a high school English teacher in Placer County, California\n\nI'm a middle school history teacher in Colorado Springs. I try to include as many perspectives as possible. For sixth grade, I teach colonization of the American continent and comparison of English colonization with Spanish colonization. This includes African diaspora, including slavery being established in 1607 and how it diverged from indentured servitude based on race and the establishment of slave codes in the late 17th century. Although the instruction contains aspects of slavery, much of what I teach is from a colonizing point of view and the Amerindians. For civics, we analyze the Constitution and the Three-fifths Compromise, but also how it did not include enslaved Black Americans, Amerindians and women. I teach how only a minority held power and could vote. Civil rights does come into the picture when we talk about the law and basic human rights. We do talk about free speech and the Bill of Rights and how rights have been limited in the past, such as with Jim Crow.\n\nI pull material from sites that end in .org or .edu so as not to appear controversial, although Howard Zinn and \"A People's History\" is part of my materials and I use primary sources. We use a lot of pictures where students try to determine what is going on. One source is looking at the Ferguson protests and the police versus protesters. The questioning used doesn't ask questions, such as \"Why are people are racist?\" but \"How do you feel about the author?\" or \"Why would someone do something like this?\"\n\nThere's been a lot of controversy in my district (Colorado Springs D49) about matters of race. Just last year, there was an art teacher in an elementary school that was reprimanded because an education video they watched featured a mural with the phrase Black Lives Matter. The district sees this as part of a controversial movement of racial division, so they claim he should have sent a permission letter to parents who might want to opt their students out o the lesson. Now our district is poised to ban CRT . It makes me apprehensive about teaching social studies next year because I don't believe they really know what CRT involves and I fear that they can label any race-based instruction as CRT. ― Mike, a sixth-grade social studies teacher in Colorado Springs\n\nI had never heard of CRT before the recent political hysteria and I would not say that I intentionally teach it. In seventh grade, I teach about the historical origins of race and how it is a social construct that still has huge social impact. We look at racism in studying world events like colonialism and the Holocaust. In U.S. history, our analysis of primary documents reveals the undeniable impact of racism from long before our nation was founded. Students in my class can identify the impact of racism in the laws that were created and the role of white supremacy in starting the Civil War and ending Reconstruction. When it comes to racism in modern America, my students of color teach me. One of my hardest-working, straight-A students had his backpack searched at a convenience store. He's Ethiopian. As a teacher, my best response to hearing experiences like this is to teach my students how to advocate for change. ― Alex Cooper, a social studies middle school teacher in Washington state\n\nI'm a high school teacher who teaches English and film analysis in Loudoun County, Virginia, a county where the CRT debate is currently raging.\n\nHere is what I can't stress enough: Nobody is teaching critical race theory. I had to Google the term to find out what it was they were up in arms about. It's a very advanced law school field of study and this debate, for the most part, is manufactured outrage.\n\nWe do try and practice something called culturally responsive teaching (note the initials ― CRT). You can probably find documents from our district that mention culturally responsive teaching. All this means is we make an effort to make all students feel as welcomed and as comfortable coming to school as possible: We try and make both the transgender kid and the MAGA teen feel like school is a place where they can be safe, learn and be respected. It's not anything any rational person could be against. I've seen some of the anti-critical race theory people point to that as \"pushing CRT.\" It isn't. It's two different things that happen to share initials.\n\nSome of the loudest voices in the movement, in this area, have started just flat-out saying they are against equity. I disagree with that, for obvious reasons. I mean, imagine holding a sign that says \"Stop Equity!\" and thinking you are the good guy. Still, at least they're honest and not hiding behind the CRT-nonsense. Attempts at equity are something that we, as a district, are engaging in.\n\nRace comes up in the classroom for a variety of reasons, but mostly because we live in the United States and it is impossible to discuss the history ― or the present ― of the country without discussing race. Specifically as it might relate to the anti-CRT nonsense, I use \"Letter from Birmingham Jail\" to teach rhetoric. In order to understand and dissect the arguments Martin Luther King Jr. was making, you have to understand the context in which he was making them. That means we have to understand the situation in Birmingham in 1963 and the people and systems that were in place that led to King being locked up. Once you do that, you can really start examining the techniques that King used to make his argument.\n\nLiterature is an engine for empathy. Reading literature doesn't work unless you are able, at least a little, to understand and share the feelings of the characters. When we read \"Letter from Birmingham Jail,\" they, hopefully, can understand the struggles and frustrations King was facing. Once they understand the perspectives of people other than themselves, they can better analyze what they think about those characters and those people's actions. It's not \"what\" that is important, but \"why,\" and we work hard to help them get to the point where they are capable of examining and analyzing the \"why\" in every situation. That's not critical race theory. That's just being a functioning human capable of independent thought, which is the point of education and something everyone should be for. ― Patrick Ayers, an English and film analysis teacher in Loudoun County, Virginia\n\nAs I high school English teacher, I never officially studied critical race theory, but when I teach my students the history surrounding the literature we read, which is often not centered on white authors, I try to teach them the truth as I understand it. We read things like \"Brown Girl Dreaming\" by Jacqueline Woodson, \"Persepolis\" by Marjane Satrapi or \"The Souls of Black Folk\" by W.E.B. Du Bois. I do some research on my own, looking at voices of people of color so that I, as a white person born in 1980, can understand history more fully.\n\nIt doesn't do the world any favors to send it adults who have big gaps in their understanding of history or our current world. When we know better, we do better. And lots of us are trying to teach our students the truth. ― Clara, a high school English teacher in Colorado\n\nI teach middle school special education, but we are attached to a high school so I have worked with older students as well. I work in an urban school comprising mostly Hispanic students.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

So, the issue of racism definitely has been discussed, especially when I have worked with high school students. They have read books like \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" \"The Other Wes Moore\" and \"Day of Tears\" that address the hard truth of the history of racism in America. We have discussed some systemic racism in the context of internment camps and segregation when students read about these topics in their history classes. We have also talked about police brutality; working at a school with many students of color, unfortunately a lot of my students have already experienced racism and an unfair justice system, so these concepts are not unfamiliar to them.\n\nStudents want to know why the things they learn matter and a lot of them are already forming their own opinions about history and about society. My goal is always to guide my students to engage in higher-level thinking and conversation, not to push my own beliefs on them. We do a lot of spontaneous research based on questions that arise and my hope is that they then use the information they find to decide for themselves what they believe about various social issues.\n\nIt's important to consider that students ― especially older ones ― actually want to have those difficult (and sometimes controversial) conversations. They do not appreciate life being sugar-coated. For example, I had a seventh grader come to me one day and ask, \"Why don't we study the history before slavery?\" We had a conversation about how slavery has, unfortunately, existed pretty much as long as civilizations have, and he wanted to understand why that was the case. So we talked about greed and oppression and racism. It was a really powerful discussion. I have never once had a student express that they feel \"shamed\" over these types of conversations. But I have witnessed multiple students develop a determination to play a role in fighting against injustice, bias and racism. A lot of times, they are the ones to bring up these topics to me ― not the other way around. Honestly, young people are amazing and they want to create a better world. Neglecting to have these conversations with them would be detrimental and unfair.\n\nI can confidently say that it is not common practice for teachers to shame white students or teach that society's problems are due to white privilege. Teachers are not diabolical, there is no conspiracy to brainwash our students. We are just doing our best to teach the truth, to teach facts, and to make sure that all students are treated with equity and respect, regardless of skin color or cultural background. ― Rachel Wilder, a special education middle school teacher in Colorado\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "A History Lesson In A Critical Race Theory-Free America\n\nThe year is 2033. A Donald Trump hologram is president. The Republicans are in control of Congress and the White House. The Supreme Court has just two liberal votes. And it's now illegal to make a white person feel even slightly uncomfortable.\n\nAfter we exhausted the Greek alphabet for new COVID-19 variants, a new pandemic dubbed COVID-26 has killed scores of people around the globe. Frustrated that Black people can technically still vote (even though it has become nearly impossible) , thousands of white people stormed the U.S. Capitol to demand martial law - but only in cities that did not vote for Hologram Trump. The military obliged. The campaign to discredit any teachers who spoke about racism was wildly successful and actual history has been banned from all schools in the United States under the auspices of removing critical race theory. The following is an excerpt from an educator's brief overview of a U.S. history class in our now-CRT-free America.\n\nI am happy to announce, on behalf of nice white parents everywhere, that education in this country is finally back on track. After completely giving up on trying to mitigate COVID-26, teachers and staffers alike are so grateful to be together, all 62 students per teacher, in cozy classrooms unmasked and unbothered.\n\nYou may have some burning questions such as what is critical race theory ? And how exactly was it previously being taught to our country's kindergarteners? While those are important questions, we're not going to address them.\n\nWhat we will address is that all across the country, white third graders were being taught to hate themselves because of slavery even though it was so long ago that literally no one is affected by it today.\n\nBut don't worry: After Republican governors in Florida and Virginia banned critical race theory from ever being taught in our schools in 2022, it caught on nationwide and now no child anywhere will even have to learn about the transatlantic slave trade. In fact, we can't even call it a slave trade, so from here on out, they will be referred to as \"low-skilled laborers with dark skin.\"\n\nHow did we get here, you ask? Back in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and officer-involved killings had certain people convinced that America was a racist country . They taught children that the policies and laws undergirding our society were based on racist ideals. Shocking, right? White people, even the ones who didn't cause any killings, felt personally attacked - so they fought back. They united in their efforts to ban books and fire any educator who dared to try and tarnish America's good name.\n\nWell, now we finally have people like Vice President Marjorie Taylor Greene and Sen. Candace Owens (their interracial friendship proves that racism hardly exists) to set the record straight and get our children back on track. Racism is rare, brief and never systematic; you can't prove it because you can never know what's truly in a man's heart.\n\nBefore the crackdown on critical race theory, you may have heard that the founding of this country was not on the up and up . Those people, however, only wanted to make white people feel bad . The truth is the Founding Fathers - who are infallible, by the way - wrote a perfect document. You may be wondering why it has so many amendments if it's so perfect. And to that I say, that wasn't a very patriotic question.\n\nWho cares if sla - er, I mean low-skilled laborers were only three-fifths of a person? What matters is that was a very long time ago and their descendants are five-fifths now.\n\nThe country only descended into a civil war in 1861 because southern states were worried about their economy . You see, those low-skilled laborers were very helpful when it came to making white people richer. And they were fighting for states' rights! But it all worked out in the end because the South lost the war. There certainly wasn't a campaign to violently overthrow any state governments that attempted to build a multiracial democracy in the aftermath. And there definitely weren't any laws or policies created to prevent the low-skilled laborers from living as free people and gaining access to land ownership or quality education .\n\nIn fact, nobody is really sure how things got to be so unequal. It certainly wasn't because of white supremacist policies or racial segregation - that would imply something divisive or uncomfortable. So we'll just say those descendants did it to themselves.\n\nOK, maybe there was a tiny bit of racism. But this part of history has a happy ending! Perhaps you've heard of the civil rights movement? In the 1960s, the descendants of those low-skilled laborers were upset that they didn't seem to have the same rights as their fair-skinned counterparts. They participated in marches and protests , but really, everyone - especially moderate white people - were on their side .\n\nThe most important takeaway from this obviously brief and unfortunate period of racism is that it's over. Martin Luther King Jr., who coincidentally died young but definitely not because of his skin color or his beliefs, gave a beautiful speech at the Washington Monument. He had a dream that your kids would stop being judged for the crime of being white.\n\nIsn't that beautiful? That one speech singularly ended the very brief racism the United States experienced.\n\nWe've been living in racial harmony ever since. It's just a coincidence that as soon as a Black person was elected president of the United States way back in 2008, your dear old Uncle Mitchell - who was never really interested in politics - started watching Fox News every night and complaining about the Blacks. After all, Barack Obama was only interested in dividing our country.\n\nAnd that time your Black co-worker was late to work because they had to drive 50 miles away from home just to cast a ballot on Election Day? Well, that was just poor planning on their part. Maybe they should've lived in a different neighborhood. And shouldn't they have been more grateful that legally they can still vote? It probably won't stay that way for much longer .\n\nI know the latest insurrection at the Capitol was perhaps a little bit violent, but let's give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they were fighting for states' rights. Or maybe it was just economic anxiety.\n\nThe takeaway from this lesson is that nothing that's happened in the past is relevant to today. I only talk about history so you can see how far we've come as a country. All of the problems those bad teachers were telling kids about - privilege, racism, inequality - that was just an attempt to brainwash our children.\n\nHow can white people have privilege if I've seen a homeless white person before and Black celebrities have millions of dollars? They claim racism, and yet every February, we allow each corporation to pander to Black people about how racism is actually over.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Please do NOT spam it with prank calls .)\n\nThe most important thing we want to factor in when teaching our children about American history is the comfort of white people. Before our new leaders took over, teachers could say abhorrent things about this country like \"it's a racist dumpster fire\" or \"it's a musty place that not even aliens would invade.\" But now, thanks to the God-fearing, country-loving Republicans, our children can remain safe and warm in their cocoons - never forced to challenge their worldview or even consider for a moment that America isn't a sparkling democracy. White parents can sleep soundly at night knowing their children will never experience the pain of finding out about topics that may make them slightly uncomfortable.\n\nWhen Martin Luther King Jr. dreamed of an America, this is clearly what he imagined."

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nRight-wing pundit Chris Rufo is stoking fears about \"critical race theory\" and \"gender ideology\" across America. Who's paying his bills? Wall Street billionaires, intent on provoking culture war to divert Americans' attention from grotesque wealth inequality.\n\nChristopher Rufo appears on Fox's Tucker Carlson Tonight in June 2021. (Fox News)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nChris Rufo, the pugilistic pundit leading the Right's charge against how public schools teach race and sexuality, is backed by billionaires who profited handsomely from the 2008 financial crisis that threw 8.6 million people out of work, 7.8 million people out of their home, and drove thousands of excess suicides.\n\nRufo is a senior fellow and prominent spokesperson at the Manhattan Institute, a right-wing think tank that has fueled recent hysteria over critical race theory (CRT) and LGBTQ curricula in schools. While the Manhattan Institute doesn't disclose its donors, the organization's board is helmed by executives who are deeply invested in preserving the country's entrenched economic inequality - and who come from a financial industry that has plundered massive wealth from communities of color.\n\nThe situation illustrates how corporate interests are quietly using their wealth to stoke hate and divide America over culture-war issues in order to divert people's attention from more pressing matters - namely, the country's grotesque wealth inequality and the near-total control Wall Street now exerts over everyone's economic lives.\n\nSince Fox News vaulted him to prominence in 2020, Rufo, who declined the Lever 's repeated interview requests, has made dozens of high-profile media appearances where he said things like : \"Critical race theory has become the default ideology of the federal bureaucracy\" and that \"Public school bureaucrats . . . are training children to experiment with sexual identities.\"\n\nThese efforts have been bankrolled by powerful Wall Street executives - including a hedge fund vulture and so-called \" Doomsday investor \" whose family donated more than $1 million to the Manhattan Institute in 2020 alone.\n\nThe Manhattan Institute for Public Policy Research, founded in 1977 by future CIA director Bill Casey and British neoliberal pioneer Antony Fisher, has played a critical role in dismantling the social safety net and criminalizing the poor under the guise of promoting \" welfare reform \" and \" broken windows \" policing.\n\nThe current chairman of Manhattan Institute's board is hedge fund manager Paul Singer. The Toronto Financial Post reported that his firm was \"profiting handsomely\" during the 2008 financial crisis \"from credit default swaps that bet leveraged companies would run aground.\" Singer's family foundation donated $1.1 million to the think tank in 2020, out of $17.9 million in total contributions the organization received that year. Singer is also known for buying sovereign debt of countries like Argentina, Peru, and the Republic of the Congo for pennies on the dollar, then using strong-arm tactics like seizing ships and planes to win full payment.\n\nHank Greenberg, the longtime former head of insurance giant AIG, as well as hedge fund manager John Paulson, are also on the Manhattan Institute's board. Paulson's family foundation donated $50,000 in 2019, the most recent year for which records are available, as well as a \" truly transformative gift \" to the institute in May 2022.\n\nOnly donations from family foundations to other organizations are disclosed, per Internal Revenue Service rules. This means that the total donations from Greenberg, Paulson, and Singer could be much higher.\n\nUnder Greenberg's leadership, AIG insured complex financial products that it lacked the reserves to support, in particular so-called collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) composed of low-quality mortgages, which prompted the $182 billion bailout of the firm in 2008 and 2009. Greenberg admitted to defrauding AIG investors about the insurance company's financial condition in 2017.\n\nPaulson, meanwhile, convinced Goldman Sachs and other banks to issue those same CDOs so that he could bet against, or \"short\" them, helping to cause the housing meltdown that created the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigated and charged Goldman in 2010 for the bank's role in the scandal, which was called \"Abacus\" for the name of the CDO. The SEC did not charge Paulson for his role. Goldman paid $550 million to resolve the SEC's allegations. Paulson earned $1 billion from the trade and $4 billion betting against the housing market.\n\nWhile these executives were benefiting from the 2008 financial crisis, the Great Recession was wreaking disproportionate havoc on communities of color. Researchers found that while white households lost 16 percent of their wealth between 2005 and 2009, Hispanic and black households lost 66 and 53 percent of their wealth , respectively. And according to an American Civil Liberties Union report, by 2031, the downturn will have cost the median black household nearly $100,000 in long-term losses.\n\nThe Manhattan Institute, as well as Singer, Greenberg, and Paulson, all failed to respond to requests for comment.\n\nOther notable Wall Street board members of the Manhattan Institute include:\n\nNow, these same people who preyed on communities of color are using their wealth and authority to whip up racist and homophobic politics.\n\nThese days, Rufo is at the center of the Manhattan Institute's highest-profile work, and his influence in the fraught debate over CRT and LGBTQ education cannot be overstated. Instead of offering constructive criticism, Rufo's central aim appears to be inflaming culture war. As he has himself admitted, \" I'm a brawler. \"\n\nRufo's guest appearances on Fox News helped manufacture a panic over public schools teaching about race in 2020, the year George Floyd's murder triggered a national reckoning on pervasive racial disparities in America, just as Fox News-backed President Donald Trump faced an uphill battle to reelection.\n\n\"Critical race theory\" is an academic movement that examines connections between racism and the American legal system. But Rufo attacked the concept as a general bugaboo, in order to stoke fear and hate nationwide. \"The goal is to have the public read something crazy in the newspaper and immediately think 'critical race theory,'\" Rufo tweeted in March 2021.\n\nRufo's campaign has been elevated by conservative Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson, who, in 2021, said that no one \"has done more in this country than Chris Rufo to expose so-called 'critical race theory' for what it really is, which is racism, unadorned, it's systemic racism if there ever was it, [Rufo] has said that clearly, and they hate him for it.\" Carlson, like Rufo, has received lucrative support from Wall Street.\n\nManhattan Institute appears to be doubling down on Rufo's incendiary approach. In early June, the think tank announced it was hiring Ilya Shapiro, a Georgetown Law professor who resigned after being investigated by the school for saying Joe Biden would nominate \"a lesser black woman\" to the Supreme Court.\n\nNow, Rufo has transitioned to pearl-clutching about LGBTQ education in public schools, positing that it allows LGBTQ-identifying teachers to \" groom \" children to be sexually exploited.\n\nIn July, Rufo tweeted: \"Tomorrow, I'll be publishing my first report in a new series on gender ideology in K-12 schools. My goal is to publish one story per week for six weeks, establishing the frame, driving multiple news cycles, and generating 500 million media impressions. Get ready to rumble.\"\n\nA week later, Rufo stated that documents he had obtained showed that \"Portland Public Schools had launched a war against the 'gender binary' and adopted a radical new curriculum teaching students to subvert the sexuality of 'white colonizers' and begin exploring 'the infinite gender spectrum.'\"\n\nRufo's backlash against the teaching of once-taboo topics in American education might be part of a larger campaign for the wholesale privatization of public schools. \"To get universal school choice, you really need to operate from a premise of universal public school distrust,\" he told an audience in April at Hillsdale College, whose president faced backlash in 2013 for referring to people of color as \"dark ones.\"\n\nRufo's targeting of public education dovetailed neatly with a top Manhattan Institute priority: the think tank is a fierce advocate of charter schools, a form of school privatization, and board chairman Singer has funded charter schools in New York City and been locked in battles with pro-public education teachers unions since 2016.\n\nRufo's financial support and subsequent ascendence is a reminder that in the \" marketplace of ideas ,\" ideas with money and power backing them carry more weight, even if they are extreme. In the 1930s, for example, the Du Ponts and other individuals affiliated with General Motors financed the work of white supremacist fascists like Vance Muse, who invented the modern \"right-to-work\" movement.\n\nRufo's rise, in fact, closely matches the success of the last big star to emerge from the Manhattan Institute: Charles Murray, who arrived at the think tank in 1981. Before joining the organization, Murray worked as a think tank researcher for the quasi-public American Institutes for Research, devising ways to make life more difficult for inner city youth.\n\nManhattan Institute financed and aggressively promoted his first book. Losing Ground . It was, in effect, a full-frontal assault on the welfare state, the central claim being that poor people would be better off if welfare programs were eliminated.\n\nFormer president Bill Clinton acknowledged Murray's contribution to his own thinking on welfare, saying Murray \"did the country a great service,\" in an interview with NBC in 1993. Clinton's embrace of welfare cuts led to the catastrophic \"welfare reform\" of 1996, which plunged an additional three hundred thousand children into deep poverty by 2005.\n\nThe publicity surrounding Losing Ground gave Murray the platform to publish an even more incendiary work in 1994, The Bell Curve , which argued that racial differences in IQ measurement were inherent. The Manhattan Institute has hosted Murray at least three times since he left the group in 1994.\n\nBoth Murray and Rufo are adept at the same strategy: take an idea that seems deranged and factually false, and weaponize it for political gain. In Murray's case, it was the elimination of welfare, an idea embraced by no organized constituency before his book's publication. In Rufo's case, it's that academics are attempting to secretly indoctrinate schoolchildren into an anti-white ideology, or to sexually abuse them by way of LGBTQ education.\n\nIn a functioning society, such ideas would be laughed out of town. But not in the United States, where the exceptionally wealthy can mold discourse to their advantage, insulating themselves from the social harms caused by their profiteering.\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nMatthew Cunningham-Cook has written for Labor Notes , the Public Employee Press , Al Jazeera America, and the Nation .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Reading the book, you soon learn that Lindsay has a shallow understanding not just of Marxism or racism in the US but the classical liberal tradition he seeks to defend.\n\nJames Lindsay speaking with attendees at the 2021 AmericaFest at the Phoenix Convention Center in Phoenix, Arizona, on December 19, 2021.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nReview of Race Marxism: The Truth About Critical Race Theory and Practice by James Lindsay (New Discourses, 2022)\n\nIn Race Marxism: The Truth About Critical Race Theory and Praxis , James Lindsay accuses critical race theory of being a \"sweeping set of conspiracy theories about race and racial power in Western liberal democracies\" that is descended from a long line of \"Marxist conspiracy theories about the upper class of society.\" Lindsay goes on to accuse critical race theory of working to penetrate and undermine \"every school, college, university; every workplace, office, hospital; every magazine, journal, newspaper; every television program, movie, website; every government agency, institution, program; every church, synagogue, mosque; every club, affinity, pastime, and interest\" in the United States and beyond.\n\nHearing Lindsay's paranoid speculations, one suspects that before long critical race theory will have inspired the shooter on the grassy knoll, concealed the remaining Romanov children, and - worst of all - ruined my night at the bar.\n\nLindsay's book is part of a new genre of conservative critiques of the Left. Gone is the old strategy of compensating for reading nothing by saying a lot. Now we get an avalanche of pages that demonstrate the author has read a lot, followed by little in the way of substance or assertion (see Mark Levin's American Marxism for the gold standard).\n\nI say this because despite Lindsay's conspiratorial claims, there is no doubt he has read more critical theory generally and critical race theory specifically than your average conservative firebrand. Race Marxism is filled with long (sometimes pages-long) quotations from major critical race theorists, typically paired with his own explanations of the meaning. Sometimes he's in the ballpark; other times it is clear he doesn't understand the thinkers he's talking about. But it is telling is that Lindsay never sets out to refute these thinkers. In fact, one of the defining features of his book is how remarkably free of arguments and counterarguments it is.\n\nThis doesn't appear to be an accident. In the concluding chapter, Lindsay describes the mess that came before as giving \"some sense of what Critical Race Theory really is, where it comes from, how it operates.\" Now, he writes, \"we can make a few tentative comments about what we can do about it.\"\n\nNote that none of this includes what should be the vital argument: why critical race theory is wrong. While the cynic might chalk up the omission to simple ignorance, I suspect the reality is far more banal. Lindsay believes that the mere presentation and mockery of his opponent's views will reveal them to be so transparently bad, or at least seen as such by a sympathetic audience, that the task of pointing out why they are in fact bad is unnecessary.\n\nTo spare the reader the triple headaches I experienced going through the book, I will give just two examples. At one point, Lindsay unpacks Derrick Bell's controversial theory of \"interest convergence.\" In a variety of publications , Bell marshals historical and legal research to argue that one rarely sees improvements in the conditions of racialized peoples unless those changes also benefit the white majority. For instance, Bell claims that many of the civil rights movement-era reforms were motivated by a desire to improve America's moral standing in the Cold War.\n\nWhatever you think about the broader argument - and it's certainly not immune to criticism - Bell's latter point is well-documented : as early as the Harry Truman administration, US officials asked the President's Committee on Civil Rights to report on the foreign policy ramifications of racial discrimination and recommend potential remedies. Lindsay never cites any evidence to rebut Bell's legal and historical claims, dismissing them as \"shocking\" \"mind reading\" demonstrative of the \"paranoia and conspiracy of Critical race theorists.\"\n\nAn even more telling example is Lindsay's long tirade against the \"historical revisionism that is central to the storytelling of Critical Race theory,\" by which he means efforts to retell the history of the United States that emphasize racial and other forms of exploitation. Lindsay's claim is an odd one, not least because revising our understanding of history is what historical research does. As we gather new evidence about the past, we arrive at a better, more complete sense of both our history and present. This is what many historical commentators have done with race, too, going back at least to Frederick Douglass's famous pricking of US hagiography in his 1852 speech \" What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July? \"\n\nSo what evidence does Lindsay present against those who argue that an honest rendering of US history must include the country's long periods of racial domination and violence - and the struggles by those at the bottom of society to wrest themselves free? Not even an iota.\n\nHe instead insists that the \"rationale\" of historical revisionism is \"raising a racial critical consciousness, which is to say manipulating people into becoming Critical Race Theorists.\" In the face of libraries worth of books about race - including many, many works written by non-critical race theorists - this is his objection. How foregrounding the bleak facts of racism in the United States is manipulation, Lindsay doesn't say.\n\nIn the few instances where Lindsay tries to offer some actual criticisms, the results are more than a little puzzling. For instance, Lindsay repeatedly parrots the conservative philosopher Eric Voegelin in describing Marxism as one in a\n\nlong line of Gnostic cult ideologies that seek to characterize God as tyrannical and the existing order of the world as a prison (hello Foucault) into which we are flung (hello Heidegger) that we can escape if we discover the true nature of \"reality\" which is a kind of consciousness that must be raised. That is, Marxism is rebellious Gnosticism reconfigured for industrial Modernity.\n\nFor one, Lindsay ignores that Voegelin argued that liberalism was also a secularized Gnostic faith, one of the reasons he has long been an influence on conservative and postliberal critics. But even more egregious is his rendering of Karl Marx.\n\nYou see, according to Lindsay, the \"prevailing view . . . that Marx offered an economic theory\" is \"not true in the slightest.\" This would come as a surprise to the Prussian theorist, who gave his magnum opus the subtitle \"a critique of political economy\" and filled thousands of pages with commentary on Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and the other classical economists.\n\nThe basis of Lindsay's argument is that Marx's Hegelian roots commit him to a kind of atheistic eschatology, where revolutionary agitation against liberal \"common sense\" and \"reality\" are to bring about an ill-defined utopia through mass violence. In reality, Marx had many good things to say about both liberalism and capitalism, and his own vision of an ideal human society was one where the \"development of human powers [is] an end in itself.\"\n\nMuch of Lindsay's misunderstanding comes from his deep misreading of Marx, whom Lindsay describes as analyzing the \"material contradictions in the conditions of the working class as compared to the wealthy bourgeois capitalists.\" Lindsay has it entirely backwards, since for Marx the disparities in conditions and power between classes were an expression of the more fundamental contradictions of capital. This is key to understanding Marx's revolutionary argument, since he didn't think reforms that only improved workers' material conditions could resolve the fundamental contradictions of capitalism.\n\nWhatever one thinks of this argument, even a cursory understanding of Marx's economic theory would correct Lindsay's errors. Though I suppose that kind of attention is unlikely since Lindsay thinks it is \"not true in the slightest\" that a figure even pro-capitalists acknowledge made important contributions to economics actually wrote about economics.\n\nMost strikingly of all, Lindsay doesn't have a robust understanding of the classical liberal doctrines he sets out to defend. To be fair, he acknowledges that Race Marxism isn't intended to provide an account of \"the good,\" which is \"too big a topic for this volume.\" But the concluding sections of the book defend a \"classical liberal\" and \"commonsense\" commitment to \"reality\" and \"human nature\" along with \"meritocracy,\" \"individualism,\" and \"rights\" (especially the right to property). He lays this out in a manifesto of sorts at the end of the book.\n\nThat all men are created equally (in the image of God) and endowed by the creator with certain inalienable rights that precede any pretense to privileges granted by the state is a great starting place. That we will therefore judge people on their merits and character, not their identity, is a solid starting place. That we can understand reality as it is, in ourselves, in pursuit of a more perfect union (not just American nation, but people more broadly) is a powerful value. That we can own things and do as we will with our property within the reasonable bounds of the law is a cornerstone of a free people.\n\nSeemingly unbeknownst to Lindsay, some of the most effective criticisms of these mythologized values have come from liberals themselves.\n\nConsider the idea of \"meritocracy\" and merit. As Michael Sandel points out in The Tyranny of Merit, both right- and left-liberal theorists throughout the twentieth century rejected meritocracy as implausible. In The Constitution of Liberty , libertarian thinker F.A. Hayek criticized meritocracy for holding that property should flow to those considered deserving rather than those who happen to benefit from purely free market transactions. If it turns out that the people want Fifty Shades of Grey novels rather than Gravity's Rainbow, the market accepts that the less meritorious author will get rich. Writing from the other side of the spectrum, John Rawls argued that the very notion of meritocracy is incomprehensible given the sheer volume of \"morally arbitrary\" factors that influence our lives. Even our natural talents are the result of a genetic lottery rather than any effort of our own - hardly the basis for a convincing moral theory.\n\nOr consider the contention that liberalism is synonymous with an unadulterated respect for private property rights. This may be true of liberals in the \" possessive individualist \" tradition, such as John Locke. But it's not even true of all classical liberals. Adam Smith lambasted arguments against higher wages for labor, arguing that capitalists would \"say nothing concerning the bad effects of high profits. They are silent with regard to the pernicious effects of their own gains. They complain only of those of other people.\" J.S. Mill, whom Lindsay has elsewhere praised as a defender of free speech, identified as a socialist. For Mill, liberalism was less about defending capitalist property rights than protecting individuals from the domination of unchecked power.\n\nLindsay is largely silent on this more left-wing side of liberalism - which explains why he can slam someone like Charles Mills in the book , while failing to acknowledge that Mills himself identified as a \"radical\" black liberal.\n\nLindsay deserves credit for reading a fair number of the major authors of critical race theory. Even if that's a low bar, it's one that other critics of so-called postmodern neo-Marxism and its offshoots haven't managed to clear. I also think the Left (or at least some quadrants of it) would benefit from dropping their affinity with postmodernism and anti-Enlightenment skepticism and adopting a more assertive approach to theory and politics.\n\nBut Lindsay's ever-so-minor accomplishments shouldn't disguise the fact that Race Marxism is a very strange, very bad book - one as light on real arguments as it is heavy on snide exposition and American exceptionalism.\n\nSo, as an antidote, I will end with the wise and prophetic words of Frederick Douglass:\n\nThe blessings in which you, this day, rejoice, are not enjoyed in common. The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity, and independence, bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight that brought life and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. This Fourth [of] July is yours , not mine . You may rejoice, I must mourn. To drag a man in fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him to join you in joyous anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony.\n\nMatt McManus is a lecturer at the University of Calgary.

But their own version of US history is a sterilized, hagiographic account that closes off connecting the issues of yesteryear with the problems of the present.\n\nTexas governor Greg Abbott has pushed the \"1836 Project\" - a selective reading of the state's history.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe latest battle over how US history is taught in public schools - part of a larger fight over how Americans see themselves - centers on \"critical race theory\" (CRT). Migrating from academia to the public sphere, CRT has become a catchall term for what, according to conservatives, currently ails the nation: a misguided belief that US society is inherently racist.\n\nThe pedagogical skirmish broke out after last year's Black Lives Matter protests, which concentrated not only on police brutality but symbols of racial tyranny such as Confederate monuments. The attack against applying a critical lens to history has only intensified in 2021. On Thursday, the Florida Board of Education passed a new rule that looks to block critical race theory - \"teaching kids to hate their country and hate each other,\" in the words of Republican governor Ron DeSantis - from the state's schools.\n\nA key marker of the current battle was the release of the 1776 Commission report during the waning days of the Trump administration. Lampooned by many historians, the 1776 Commission has become the template for several states seeking to counter the New York Times ' 1619 Project . This year, the South Carolina state legislature debated a bill that would have used the 1776 Commission report for US history in middle- and high-school classrooms.\n\nConservatives insist they're countering the pernicious influence of biased, propaganda-filled teachings that run down the United States. But what many conservatives clearly want isn't a balanced portrayal of the past but a sterilized, hagiographic account that closes off connecting the issues of yesteryear with the problems of the present.\n\nThe 1776 Commission's report absurdly equates \"progressivism\" with slavery and fascism and argues that the racism of the Jim Crow South was, for all intents and purposes, equal to the \"racism\" of another modern bogeyman, \"identity politics.\" Regarding the goals and achievements of the Civil Rights Movement, the authors write that the movement \"was almost immediately turned to programs that ran counter to the lofty ideals of the founders.\" The report condemns even modest policies, such as affirmative action, as \"explicit group privilege\" that threaten the very foundations of American freedom.\n\nIn Texas, Republican governor Greg Abbott and his allies are pushing the \"1836 Project\" - a reading of the state's history that will likely leave out one of the critical reasons white Texans fought for independence in the 1830s: keeping and enshrining slavery in territory that belonged to Mexico. A project about Texas history could be rich in content, focusing on not just white Texans but Indigenous peoples and Africans and Latinos in the region. It could discuss ideological battles over what freedom meant and who was to be included in the American project. Instead, we can expect the 1836 Project to offer the usual story of heroism at the Alamo, omitting the moments when white Texans fought to preserve slavery against the Mexican government in 1836 and the American government during the Civil War.\n\nIn his chapter \"The Propaganda of History\" in Black Reconstruction in America 1860-1880 , W. E. B. Du Bois warned that the purpose of history is not to shy away from its most painful elements. \"If . . . we are going to use history for our pleasure and amusement, for inflating our national ego, and giving us a false but pleasurable sense of accomplishment,\" Du Bois argued, \"then we must give up the idea of history either as a science or as an art using the results of science, and admit frankly that we are using a version of historic fact in order to influence and educate the new generation along the way we wish.\"\n\nThe kind of propaganda Du Bois was writing against in Black Reconstruction threatens, in one form or fashion, to return as the norm in US schools. Dealing with history as history and not merely as propaganda means being serious about America's past.\n\nConservatives may not like it, but African Americans have a long history of teaching themselves and anyone else who would listen about the trials and tribulations of American history. Black-run primary schools in the twentieth-century South often had to work hard to give their students the historical lessons they needed to understand where they came from and where they could go. This wasn't about besmirching the United States - it was about building a democracy worth the name.\n\nThere is a reason, after all, that many in the Civil Rights Movement explicitly invoked various moments in US history. During his 1965 speech in the aftermath of the Selma to Montgomery march, Martin Luther King Jr cited C. Vann Woodward's The Strange Career of Jim Crow and its portrayal of the Reconstruction and populist eras in Southern history as examples of aborted attempts at biracial democracy. \"If it may be said of the slavery era that the white man took the world and gave the Negro Jesus,\" King proclaimed, \"then it may be said of the Reconstruction era that the Southern aristocracy took the world and gave the poor white man Jim Crow.\" Knowledge of the past that showed the possibility of a multiracial coalition fighting for justice - no matter how tenuous - meant it could be done again.\n\nThe vision of history sought by those in favor of banning critical race theory or following the 1776 Commission's precepts is one where the United States has solved all its problems and where the only issue is recalcitrant minority groups trying to change the past. Instead, we must hold on to an idea of US history that is more difficult and complicated than a rosy fairy tale.\n\nA version of the nation's past that ignores its problems is not merely propaganda - it is bad history.\n\nRobert Greene II is an assistant professor of history at Claflin University and publications chair for the Society of US Intellectual Historians and lead associate editor for Black Perspectives .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Critical race theory is the explanation du jour; soon enough, something else shiny will catch their eye.\n\nNewt Gingrich, who was deeply obsessed with Saul Alinsky in 2012, appears on CNN.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nYou don't hear much about it anymore, but about a decade ago the US right was absolutely obsessed with the book Rules for Radicals and its author, Saul Alinsky. If, like most people, you haven't bothered to read Rules , it's mostly just a guy giving some general advice to people involved with local activism. A lot of it is hilariously banal and intuitive - stuff like \"keep the pressure on, with different tactics and actions.\" Some of it is the sort of meaningless mysticism you find in books like The Art of War for the Modern Retail Manager: for example, \"if you push a negative hard and deep enough it will break through into its counterside; this is based on the principle that every positive has its negative.\"\n\nThere is also some good but pretty innocuous advice here as well, like Alinsky's point that you should find ways to make activism fun so that people don't get burned out. In general, however, I don't think there's much here that you wouldn't learn from a year of working in a leadership role in any small political organization.\n\nHilariously, this is not how the Right understood Rules at all.\n\nThe standard take was that Alinsky had written some kind of dark tome that laid out the satanic ambitions of the Left - and our nefarious strategies for achieving them. If you did not know about Rules, then you could really never really know what we were up to, since the enemies of the Right were liars, and secretive, and carrying out alien intellectual theories that no normal person would ever think of. But if you knew about Rules , then you would instantly understand what all of these demonic weirdos were up to - and you'd be able to stop them.\n\nFor years , a mainstream premise in right-wing rhetoric was that you could interpret just about anything leftists did as following the orders laid out for them in their handbook, Rules for Radicals . This was true not just of leftists but of liberals as well - from Parenti to Pelosi to your next door neighbor Pete.\n\nMercifully, around the end of the Obama era, this line finally became passé on the right - but by then, a new one had started to gain steam. Rhetoric about something called \"cultural Marxism\" had been floating around for a long time by then, but in the mid-2010s, it moved from AM talk radio platforms like The Michael Savage Show into the mainstream. Around the same time, this rhetoric also began to concentrate around a specific fixation on the Frankfurt School .\n\nBut once again, the Right's analysis did not actually seem to have very much to do with the actual texts in question. You did not see a lot of commentary about how policymakers were reading Erich Fromm 's discussion of the Protestant work ethic, or how the praxis of Bernie Sanders was informed by Barthes's semiotic theory of mythology. Nor, of course, did you see much talk on the right about how the Frankfurt School is in many ways at odds with some basic points of orthodox Marxism.\n\nInstead, the mysterious Frankfurt School mostly played the same role in our discourse that Rules for Radicals did a few years before. In both cases, we were presented with relatively obscure texts which, if you understood them, exposed all kinds of profound occult truths about the otherwise unknowable machinations of leftists.\n\nMatt Bruenig has written a nice little explainer about critical race theory (CRT) - that is, about what CRT actually is . But this, of course, does not answer a second, equally interesting question: why in God's name is the Right obsessed with this?\n\nAt this point, the standard answer on the Left seems to be \"racism,\" but that really only explains why CRT is on the table as one of many things that reactionaries could get mad about. If you want to know why the Right is melting down about CRT in particular, I think the history I've sketched out above provides us with a good explanation.\n\nEvery few years, the American right discovers a relatively obscure text or theory that, we are told, lays out the secret governing plans and doctrines of the anarchomarxistliberaldemocrat conspiracy. This narrative coalesces spontaneously because it does all kinds of useful things for the right:\n\nThis last point also explains why particular iterations of this narrative eventually fall out of favor. You can only say so many times that we can defeat socialists by learning about Rules for Radicals before folks on the Right start asking, \"why haven't we won yet?\"\n\nOver the last year or so, talk about the Frankfurt School finally went out of style as well, and if you watched closely you could see pundits and intellectuals on the right fishing around for the newest Dark Secret of the Left. Seems pretty clear that CRT is filling that role, but if you find this whole debate annoying don't worry - we'll presumably get to our next Dark Secret of the Left in 2024, 2026, or 2028.\n\nCarl Beijer is a writer at carlbeijer.com .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

(Wikimedia Commons)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAccording to the National Review , conservative talk show host Charlie Kirk has recently added the name Baruch Spinoza to a list of enemies that includes so-called \"cultural Marxists\" Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault.\n\nDerrida and Foucault are familiar enough names, especially to anyone who remembers the political correctness debates of the 1980s, in which postmodernism was declared the enemy of reason and even America. But Spinoza, a seventeenth-century Dutch rationalist, seems distinctly out of place and nonthreatening. At least initially.\n\nOne of the things that distinguishes the current panic over \"wokeness\" from the earlier political correctness debates is that, while the latter was about defending the Western canon against postmodern identity politics, today's culture warriors increasingly trace the roots of ideas like what they call critical race theory back to fixtures of Western philosophy like Immanuel Kant - a view that was recently repeated in Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's Supreme Court confirmation hearing . Now, it seems, Spinoza has joined a centuries-old conspiracy to destroy our Western values with something called \"social justice.\"\n\nHowever, if you take a step a back from the increasingly paranoid turn in right-wing culture wars, you could argue that Spinoza is actually a worthy enemy for the Right. After all, Marxist philosophers and theorists have repeatedly turned to Spinoza in the past. In fact, there is an entire tradition of \"Marxist Spinozism,\" from Louis Althusser to Antonio Negri.\n\nIt seems unlikely though that Charlie Kirk has been reading Frédéric Lordon's Figures du Communisme. Rather than focus on Spinoza's embrace by the Marxist left, a better question might be: What specifically did Spinoza write that poses a legitimate challenge to right-wing kooks?\n\nSpinoza's main political intervention during his lifetime, the Theological-Political Treatise , has the wordy subtitle: \"By means of which it is shown not only that the freedom of philosophizing can be allowed in Preserving Piety and the Peace of the Republic: but also that it is not possible for such Freedom to be upheld except when accompanied by the Peace of the Republic and Piety Themselves.\" In other words, Spinoza advocated for the freedom to think and philosophize.\n\nGiven that much of the Right, from Donald Trump to Elon Musk, has coalesced around the demand for \"free speech,\" Spinoza would seem a natural ally. But, it is precisely in how Spinoza configures this demand for speech, and how he understands the connection between philosophy and politics, that shows he is anathema to everything the Right stands for.\n\nFor starters, for Spinoza, the true enemy of the freedom to think, speak, and philosophize is not state censorship at all, but something else altogether: superstition. And superstition is something today's right-wing demagogues traffic heavily in.\n\nWriting in the middle of the seventeenth century, Spinoza was acutely aware of the way Scripture became not just an authority of knowledge but for politics as well. He was even banned from the small Jewish community in Amsterdam for his heretical beliefs and witnessed firsthand the struggle between modern philosophy and the political authority of religious scripture.\n\nThe conflict between the authority of scripture and science defined Spinoza's period, affecting thinkers from Galileo to Descartes. Uniquely, Spinoza saw the dispute over superstition and reason not as one between rulers and the people, as liberal philosophers argued, but as intrinsic to all political life and, more intriguingly, as a struggle internal to every individual.\n\nIn other words, superstition is not just an external power, like state censorship, but is the force of obedience that in a sense comes from within us.\n\nAs Spinoza writes,\n\nThe supreme mystery of despotism, its prop and stay, is to keep men in a state of deception, and with the specious title of religion to cloak the fear by which they must be held in check, so that they will fight for their servitude as if for salvation, and count it no shame, but the highest honor to spend their blood and their lives for the glorification of one man.\n\nLong before Karl Marx, Spinoza's formulation offers something akin to a theory of ideology: it's not as though the ruling ideas are just the ideas of the ruling class, while the rest of us suffer passively under their domination. People actively fight against their own interests, and their own liberation. Instead of striving to be more free and rational, they struggle to maintain their servitude and with it the authority of those who claim to know for them.\n\nTo grasp this paradox - that people can fight for their servitude as if it were salvation - it is necessary to understand the connection Spinoza draws between knowledge and politics, which holds the key to understanding the power of superstition. The relationship between knowledge and politics, how we think and how we live, is at the center of Spinoza's philosophy. In fact, while Spinoza's contemporaries were separating their method for knowing the world from their way of living in it, Spinoza, in one of his most provocative formulations, saw thinking and living, mind and body, as two sides of the same reality.\n\nSpinoza's central work, the Ethics , is as much a book about the nature of knowledge, reality, the mind, and the body as it is a guide for how to live. There, Spinoza shows that we are subject to superstition because we are born conscious of our desires but ignorant of the causes of things. Moreover, we necessarily fill the gaps in our understanding of the world with our desires: we call things chaotic because they do not fit with our plans, or evil because they seem to threaten our desired way of life.\n\nWhat Spinoza calls imagination, or inadequate knowledge, is what happens when we confuse the way something affects us for what it is. For example, our fear of snakes becomes misrecognized as a quality of the snake itself, which we then perceive to have evil properties. Since, according to Spinoza, we always act in light of some end, trying to realize our desires and plans in the world, we also tend to interpret the world in a similar manner, as if all things in it were guided by a determinate end. In that way, things that help us in nature are understood to be the product of a divine plan to assist us, while the things that harm us are understood to be a judgment or punishment for our actions.\n\nIt is at that point that what Spinoza refers to as prejudice, the basic ignorance of causes and lack of awareness of our own desires, becomes superstition, a doctrine or dogma that claims to know the true motives and causes of the world. The default in our knowledge becomes a doctrinal way of making sense of the world.\n\nIn other words, prejudice turns into superstition when our ignorance and desire are socialized: when the belief in final causes becomes something that people can exploit by convincing others of their interpretation. Prejudice is an attempt to make sense of the world with the little that we know, based on our own desires; superstition is an attempt to organize that basic striving of individuals to grapple with the world with the ultimate goal of gaining power.\n\nOf course, the dilemma that Spinoza wrote about, in which natural prejudice is exploited by superstition, was specific to the social dynamics of a period in which ignorance could be manipulated through Scripture. However, Spinoza's ideas extend beyond the critique of religion. Spinoza's fundamental point is that we all start from a point of fundamental ignorance, unaware of the causes of things; the relevant political distinction, in Spinoza's day and our own, is between those who exploit that ignorance and those who seek to overcome it. For Spinoza, liberation is just that: a striving to overcome ignorance through the transformation of how we think about the world.\n\nThis brings us back to Charlie Kirk and the world of right-wing talk radio, podcasts, and TV media - a world full of prejudice and superstition.\n\nIn a sense, the entire right-wing media sphere begins from simple desires, often to hold onto one's status or sense of security in the world. What matters in the world of Alex Jones, Ben Shapiro, and others is not the nature of the threats or their actual causal relation to the insecurity we are feeling. What matters is the way that they affect us and influence our desires.\n\nTo take contemporary examples, things like mandatory corporate diversity training or learning about the history of slavery in school can make one feel bad. One deduces that the effect (knowing the history of slavery) must be the cause of what one is feeling, so that the specifically bad way we feel about diversity training or slavery can somehow explain its causal condition. Effects are turned into causes. If learning about slavery makes one feel bad then it must be because it was designed to do so.\n\nCritical race theory exists to make people feel bad - and advance the cause of \"liberal guilt\" - in the same way that snakes are evil. An effect of the thing has become its defining attribute.\n\nThis inversion, taking effects as causes, becomes a formula for making sense of the world. The less one understands the real causes of the economic and political factors that have made the world bewildering and threatening, the more willing one is to make sense of it in terms of our desire and the unseen intentions that inform them.\n\nSince, according to Spinoza, desires and intentions are how we act in the world and make sense of our actions, they also become the way that we interpret the workings of the world. Conspiracy theories, we might say, are the secular version of the final-cause frame of mind once associated with Scripture and religion: through the conspiracy theory, we see behind the world to the darker forces orchestrating devious plans.\n\nIn this conspiratorial thought, the effect of a thing becomes a cause, and everything is interpreted according to intentions and plans: not only is the \"final cause\" taken as the interpretive principle, but in doing so, the real effects of material things are inverted to become causes, and, eventually, sinister plans. Following that same logic, the world becomes a series of signs to be decoded - usually by a self-anointed \"free thinker\" - in order to see the true intentions underlying them.\n\nThis actually has much to do with freedom of speech and philosophy. It certainly is true that Spinoza was an advocate of the freedom to speak and voice opinions, even (possibly) conspiratorial ones. In fact, Spinoza, who always grounded his understanding of politics in an understanding of both human nature and broader natural processes, foresaw that it was inevitable and natural that people with different experiences and histories would see things differently. Any attempt to suppress our natural divergences would only make it so that people did the same things, said the same things, and thought the same thoughts. Which would be both tyrannical and doomed to fail.\n\nHowever, this does not mean that the proliferation of opinions and prejudices is itself good or worthwhile. Spinoza's political ideal may have been, as philosopher Étienne Balibar put it, \"as many people, thinking as much as possible,\" but the point was not to celebrate a multitude of conflicting prejudices free to vent and rage at each other. For Spinoza, the point of freedom of thought and speech has a determinate end: to arrive at \"adequate,\" or true knowledge.\n\nHow do we arrive at true knowledge? This happens through what Spinoza called common notions. Notions are \"common\" when they involve understanding the causal relations - physical, natural, but also social, economic, and political - that affect everything (i.e., that are held in common). Understanding things through their complex and intersecting causal relations is the opposite of understanding things through their effects: the latter, characteristic of conspiracy theories, can find only intentions. Spinoza's knowledge in common recognizes that the world in all of its complex causality not only exceeds our intentions but the intentions of any one individual, class, or group. This is one of the important points of contact between Spinoza and Marx, of which there are many.\n\nFor Spinoza, the question of speech was ultimately about power, understood as an increase or decrease in our collective and individual power to act or think. Nearly four hundred years later, this still seems to be a good way to approach the central question of freedom of speech: rather than focus on the abstract right to say something or not in a classroom or internet forum, it might be more useful to ask how can such spaces be used to spread common notions and help us make sense of our collective conditions, rather than disseminate prejudices and superstition.\n\nCharlie Kirk and the world of right-wing radio are right to see Spinoza as their enemy. Although they are not quoting Scripture, they are on the side of superstition in the specific sense that Spinoza had in mind: they build their base of power from inadequate ideas, cobbling together a worldview that only sees the effects of the complex interaction of social, political, and economic factors.\n\nMost importantly of all, right-wing conspiracy theorists do not seek to transform ignorance but exploit it, captivating their audience with a never-ending search for signs of impending danger. Naturally, this suits them just fine since they are the self-anointed interpreters of those same ciphers.\n\nFor the rest of us, however, we can't let our very real fears and anxieties be connected to imaginary causes. The costs are too high: at stake is our understanding of the actual causes of our fears, and, with that comprehension, the collective power to grasp the conditions of our knowledge and transform them.\n\nJason Read is a professor of philosophy at the University of Southern Maine and the author of The Production of Subjectivity: Marx and Philosophy (Brill, 2022).

Along the way, many of you wrote in to share your thoughts and feelings about our episode on critical race theory .\n\nIt's a complicated subject with a lot of history and nuance to unpack, and some of you were interested in learning more. So we reached out to Trip Gabriel , a national correspondent and our guest, to answer some of your questions.\n\nWhat is critical race theory (C.R.T.)?\n\nCritical race theory is a concept , once the domain of graduate schools, that some observers say is now influencing American K-12 curriculums. The theory argues that historical patterns of racism are ingrained in law and other modern institutions, and that the legacies of slavery, segregation and Jim Crow still create an uneven playing field for Black people and other people of color. The idea is that racism is not a matter of individual bigotry but is systemic in America. Recently critics have made C.R.T. a catchall target for opposition to equity efforts, affirmative action and \"wokeness\" in general.\n\nConservatives object that critical race theory is a gauntlet thrown down to accuse all white Americans of being racist, of dividing people by race into oppressors and oppressed. Democrats are conflicted. Some worry that arguing that America is racist to the root - a view that is conventional wisdom among elements of the party's progressive wing - contradicts the opinion of most Americans and is handing Republicans a political cudgel for the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nDo you have any examples of how C.R.T. is being taught in schools?\n\nYou'd have to look long and hard to find any K-12 classroom where the term \"critical race theory\" comes up. Instead, what critics tend to target is the influence of concepts derived from C.R.T. that infuse the equity training field (some examples include acknowledging and subverting white privilege, or labeling people as oppressors or oppressed based on identity). This kind of training has been offered by various school districts to teachers in the name of combating implicit bias.\n\nWhile the anti-C.R.T. activist Christoper F. Rufo lists 11 examples of \"critical race theory in education,\" most are examples of schools offering teachers diversity training. He also cites a lesson planned for third graders in Cupertino, Calif., in which students were asked to draw an \"identity map\" listing their race, class and gender, and the teacher was asked to identify some characteristics as part of the \"dominant culture.\" But according to The Washington Post , the lesson was canceled after one use when parents complained.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Better question, should it be?\n\nIf you turn on cable news, there's a good chance you'll catch a segment on the biggest issue said to be threatening students these days - not COVID, nor unequal facilities, or guns, but critical race theory.\n\nIt's the academic theory that race and racism aren't just about individual actors and actions. Critical race theory looks at the inner workings of bigger structures that foment and maintain gaps between different racial groups. In short, racism isn't always burning crosses and using racial slurs. It's a normalized, systemic effort. Critical race theory got its start in the world of law. But as the story seems to go, it migrated to workplaces, the defense industry, and finally, to schools - but did it?\n\nI'm Jane Coaston, and you've probably heard a lot of people arguing about critical race theory in schools - either that a kid reading about the story of Ruby Bridges is being exposed to the dangerous theories of critical race theory, or that critical race theory isn't being used in schools at all. But my take is maybe one you haven't heard. I think it would be pretty OK if people used critical race theory to talk about race and racism in schools, but based on some of the lesson plans I'm hearing about, that seems to be more about making white people feel bad than removing structural barriers to equal opportunity. I don't think that's what's happening. One of the most prominent voices against so-called critical race theory in education is Chris Rufo. He first mentioned the idea on Tucker Carlson almost a year ago. Now, one of his main jobs is leading the charge against critical race theory. He's a senior fellow and director of the Initiative on Critical Race Theory at the Manhattan Institute. And he's one of my guests today. My other guest Rick Banks, researches race and law, and strongly disagrees with Chris - and maybe with me. He's a law professor and co-founder and faculty director of the Stanford Center for Racial Justice. I think we're going to have some disagreements on this episode.\n\nChris Rufo and Professor Banks, thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it.\n\nIt's great to be with you.\n\nIt's a pleasure, I've been looking forward to it.\n\nExcellent, I have also. So Rick, I want to start with you. What is critical race theory?\n\nWell, the idea of critical race theory has mutated, so that now I'm not sure what it means. Critical race theory as I know it originated within the legal academy, among law professors in particular. And more specifically, Derrick Bell was a central figure in the development of critical race theory. And what critical race theory was was a response to what we can describe as the failures of civil rights reforms. In other words, it was an attempt to answer the question of - once we've ended slavery and we had Reconstruction, and then we had a Civil Rights Era, and then we passed a lot of legislation, and then the Supreme Court invalidated segregation - once we had all of that happen, why did racial equality not result? And so critical race theory is a way to answer that question. And it answers that question by reference to the centrality of race in the formulation of law and in the effects of laws. A really simple way to think about this question is to - say, if the Supreme Court invalidated de jure segregation in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, how is it that a full decade later, the Black kids were still in segregated schools? Critical race theory attempts to answer that question. The debate that we're having now in society, I don't really see it as about critical race theory per se. We have laws that are being passed that prohibit the teaching of critical race theory in elementary schools or middle schools or high schools, but I've never encountered - as a parent of three children, I've never encountered critical race theory being taught in elementary or middle school, or high school, even. So that's not really about critical race theory. That's kind of really a broader question about how do we want to teach about and think about race in American society.\n\nWhich we are going to get to. Chris, what was the origin of your concern about critical race theory - because when I first heard of you, it was because you went to the White House under the Trump administration and attended meetings. And you tweeted about how critical race theory was the focus. And in the New Yorker profile that you had, you said that critical race theory is the perfect villain, because its connotations are negative to most middle class Americans. It's academic, divisive, poisonous, elitist, and anti-American. So where did - how did you get into this, and where did that come from?\n\nWell, I think first we should take a step back. And I think there are really two critical race theories we're talking about. Professor Banks outlines, really, the idea of critical race theory in the legal academy in 1989. But critical race theory is a critical theory, which means that it operates dialectically, which means that it's constantly changing and mutating and progressing. And critical race theory - although, absolutely, it started at Harvard Law School, at other elite legal institutions, has moved dialectically and extended its territory. You can even read in Critical Race Theory: An Introduction that the critical race theories themselves say in many ways they've been more successful in implementing their ideas in the educational system than in the legal system. There's now a huge body of evidence - critical pedagogy, culturally responsive teaching, et cetera. There are these massive, 400 page textbooks called things like Critical Race Theory And Education where they're taking the ideas and the theories. And then, like all critical theories, applying them through the praxis, or practice, to education. And even just down the street from Professor Banks in Cupertino, California, not too far from Stanford Law School, they were teaching intersectionality, which is a key component of critical race theory, to third graders, forcing them to deconstruct their racial identities. In class, according to their, quote, power and privilege. This is -\n\nI want to jump in very quickly. I would say that critical race theory has shifted and changed, because I think that that is what a theory would do in response to new ideas and new evidence. I spoke with Kimberle Crenshaw, a couple of years ago. She's the person who came up with the concept of intersectionality as part of critical race theory. And it basically argues that people's identities intersect - for instance, I am a Black woman, so I experience the experiences of being Black, but also the experiences of being a woman and the culmination of that is that I have experiences that my dad might not have as a Black man and my mom might not have as a white woman. Kimberle Crenshaw wrote a paper at the University of Chicago in the late 1980s. And when I've had folks who disagree with intersectionality as it's practiced read that paper, they're like, well, that seems sensible. And it seems to me, Chris, that what you're saying, in some ways - and I don't want to put words in your mouth - is that there is the critical race theory that's the legal academy that Rick just brought up. And then there is critical race theory, the practice that you see in schools. Is that what you're saying? I just want to be clear here.\n\nYeah, I think that's right. I mean, the summary that Rick laid out I think was accurate in my reading. I think those are all really valuable questions. I think those are really key questions. But as you've said the, critical race praxis, the component of the critical theory that is supposed to be applied - and you have to remember that a critical theory is distinguished from a traditional theory, because its goal is not merely to observe the world to reveal the truth, but to actually change the world. Therefore, you have to measure it not only in abstract terms in academic terms, but you actually have to look - well, what is it doing to society? What is it doing in classrooms? What is its impact in practice? And the reason I'm bringing up the example in Cupertino, for example, is really to say it's not only false that critical race theory hasn't made its way into classrooms. I have dozens of stories about it. So I think we need to come up with - either we debate them separately, we talk about them separately, or we talk about them together. But the idea that critical race theory isn't in schools. I think is a myth and not supported by the evidence.\n\nBut I do want to note kids exist in a context. They are aware that they are going to school, probably - either with kids who look very different from them or in a lot of schools in America, still, with kids who very much look exactly the same as they do. And they may go to one school while all the white kids go to this different school, and they're curious as to why that is. Maybe the question is not necessarily - here are some bad ways to talk about this, but is there a better way to talk about this?\n\nObviously, yeah, I think there is a better way, but I think that there's another kind of bait and switch that I've seen over and over and over from educators, where you come up with an example like forcing third graders to deconstruct their racial identities, or forcing middle school teachers in Springfield, Missouri to locate themselves on an oppression matrix. And then there's people who say, well, that's not real critical race theory. Real critical race theory has never been tried. And yet, there's evidence that is accumulating day by day that when these ideas are applied, they end up with these awful practices that I think all three of us agree should not be in the classroom. So the question - what I think of as critical race theory is not to measure it in the abstract, not to say, well, are the abstract ideas good or bad? We can have a formal debate. But actually, I think the obligation, especially in a school setting, is to measure its success by its practical outcomes. And I don't think that you can separate them. And then whenever I bring up the actual specifics that happen, people back away. My argument would be simply if something is producing negative outcomes or poor practices, maybe the problem is in the theory itself. Maybe the theory that yields bad outcomes is the source of those bad outcomes.\n\nBut there are different strands to this discussion of race in the classroom right. And one strand focuses on identity, and is kind of obsessed with people's individual identities, and intersectionality, and oppression matrices. And I'm not in favor of all of that generally in the classroom, especially for young people. But there's another strand, which just focuses on our ability to tell the truth about American society both past and present. And there, the question is whether the prior situation, where we don't talk about race, whether there are harms that have resulted from that - and I would suggest that there are. And even in my own life, for example, and I say this as a law professor now - I was taught as a child that the Civil War wasn't really about slavery. It was about other stuff. It was about states' rights. And then you flash forward 30 years later, my son is in elementary school in liberal, progressive California. And he's taught about the end of slavery, and Abraham Lincoln as the Great Emancipator, and it was such a wonderful thing. And then he's taught about the Civil Rights era. And he raised a question in his class - well, what happened between slavery and the Civil Rights era. Like, why didn't ending slavery solve all the problems? And the teacher had omitted mention of lynching, omitted mention of the racial terrorism that actually has shaped the history of our family. And none of that appeared in the curriculum. So that's the sort of thing that is, I think, much more common than the examples you're giving, that we have this willful blindness to aspects of history that are uncomfortable, and that undermines our ability to recognize the challenges that we face in a society. Because we continue to reside within this sort of happy story about progress and freedom and equality and liberty, and to not recognize some of the complications of the story. And ultimately, it actually undermines the goals of education, because what we need children to most take from their schooling is the ability to be critical thinkers - right, and they can't be critical thinkers if we are systematically shielding them from some of the unhappy parts of the story.\n\nI would make two points. I mean, first, I started my kind of public school education in the late 1980s, and then moved forward from there - K through 12 public schools in California. I learned all about the history of slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, Native American genocide, the Black Codes, et cetera. And I think that's important. I think that's foundational. You have to be taking an honest look at history, a hard look at history, including those enormous injustices. I think that's probably pretty standard. I think if you looked at the K through 12 school curriculum today in 2021 that you would find all of those as part of the history. I think that's good. But you can do that without critical race theory. I think there's another mutation in the rhetoric where when people say we don't like intersectionality, we don't like deconstructing identities, all of those buzzwords that seem to be creeping into the public education system - we just want to teach honest history. And I think that those are separate things. For example, I had what I think is a kind of comprehensive history of racial injustice in American public schools without critical race theory.\n\nYou had an extraordinary education, because I've taught law students here at Stanford Law School who are flabbergasted to learn that racially restrictive covenants were used in Northern California to restrict who could live where. Students arrived at law school and they are unaware of these very basic legal devices - racially restrictive covenants, which typically would bar entry to certain races. And this has shaped our entire nation. And most people actually don't know about that. So it's - I find it hard to believe that they're being taught about that in high school.\n\nAre there people advocating very strongly for critical race theory to be taught in schools, or is it mostly people advocating against it?\n\nWell, I think there's both. The people who are advocating very strongly for critical race theory in K through 12 education are teachers' unions. The NEA, the largest teachers' union in the country, just this summer endorsed critical race theory at their annual convention. The public school bureaucracies are also very much in favor. In many cases, not in all cases, but in many cases programs, of kind of diversity, equity, and inclusion include some of these tenets of critical race theory. And again, even in Professor Banks' kind of home area, Santa Clara County, the Office of Education has strongly endorsed critical race theory among - amidst, included, in their ethnic studies program, in which they denounced the United States as a, quote, parasitic system based on the invasion of settlers. And they're encouraging teachers to, quote, cash in on kids' inherent empathy in order to radicalize them into critical pedagogies and the kind of Freirean notion of revolution.\n\nI'm not aware of these particular expressions of this commitment that you're talking about.\n\nChris, you've been very involved in legislation that is attempting to remove this.\n\nYes. This is how I think about this, and so this is what informs my views. I spent years directing a documentary for PBS, public television, in and out of a public housing project in Memphis, Tennessee in the 38126 ZIP code. And I kind of often find myself reflecting on that experience, reflecting on the thousands of conversations I had, all of the research that I did, all of the people that I met. And then finding there's such an enormous gap between what people told me where their real life concerns in South Memphis, the things that really impacted their life. And clearly, in South Memphis, it's that top of the Mississippi Delta. You can feel the legacy of slavery, segregation, institutionalized racism. You can see it, almost. It's palpable. So no one would deny or even minimize that. But then the solutions that come from critical race theory are - what I think are elite driven and elite serving solutions. They are things that are very good for Robin DeAngelo selling seminars and Ibram Kendi also making children's books and self-help manuals, but don't actually solve the problems for the people that I know and met and really admire and care for in South Memphis.\n\nThanks for that, Chris, but let me offer an alternative interpretation, though, which is that the villain here is actually not critical race theory. The villain is actually the set of conditions and the tendencies that gave rise to critical race theory. Right - so for example, we have always been unwilling to address the intertwining of race and class in American society. We've been unwilling to actually commit to do the things that would bring forth a true racial equality. When Brown v. Board of Education was decided, for example, in 1954, the court said you can't bar or require students to go to racially segregated schools. And it pretty much stopped there, right? And the court declined to do any of a gazillion other things that might have helped to produce racially integrated schools, or that might have helped to create more equitable or more effective education nationwide. So the problem that we have in society, I think is really that we want to imagine that if we make some small tweaks around the edges, that will produce change. But it rarely does, and that's why race continues to be the problem that it is in American society. So we all have incentives to take the easy way out rather than do the hard work of racial justice, but that's not because of critical race theory. Critical race theory is really meant to illuminate that tendency in all of us so that hopefully we can do better. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nWe're still collecting your anecdotes for a future COVID related episode. Have you successfully convinced a vaccine hesitant person in your life to get the COVID vaccine? Tell me about it in a voicemail by calling 347-915-4324. We might play an excerpt of it on a future episode.\n\nThere is a common issue here of, like, yes, the performative act of anti-racism has markedly little to do with anti-racism. You haven't eliminated disparities that I witness all the time. That problem, I don't think, would be eradicated by banning critical race theory.\n\nThose are kind of two separate problems, right? So if you want to look at the problem - I think the three of us are in agreement on the problem. And I'll give you an example that illustrates it. Buffalo public schools in New York - I did a long report on Buffalo. This is a public school district that has, by 5th grade, only 20% of students are proficient in math and 18% are proficient in reading. I mean this is a human tragedy. It's a disaster. This is something that should be sending red alarms through our society. But instead of reforming itself, the public school bureaucracy in Buffalo has adopted a, quote, Black Lives Matter curriculum that teaches that really the solution is to disrupt the Western nuclear family, to create queer affirming spaces, to dismantle cis gender privilege, et cetera, et cetera - the kind of catch phrases of popular critical race theory ideology. But the question that I think both of you are asking and I'm asking is, what does this do for the kids who can't read by the end of elementary school?\n\nI think we actually agree on that. I think we actually agree that that doesn't help the kids who can't read.\n\nYeah, that seems less about, like, critical race theory. I want to get to some of the legislation that you've been working on. You're director of initiatives on critical race theory at the Manhattan Institute. So Chris, you've got some stakes in the game here. But I want to get into some of the language you've used with regard to wins on this. For instance, an Idaho bill H0377. And you said last year on Tucker Carlson, I declared a one man war against critical race theory in public institutions. Today, we have built an army of families, parents, writers, lawyers, activists, and legislators, fighting together to defeat this divisive and anti-American ideology. I want to get to - because that seems that sounds, I mean, I know we all talk differently to different people. But that sounds very different from your critiques of how this looks in a system where not enough kids are getting up to grade level in reading. That sounds to me about an argument about - not whether or not critical race theory is effective, or this interpretation I should say, of critical race theory, but that it's divisive and anti-American.\n\nFirst of all, when you're on cable television, unfortunately, you have two minutes to make your case. It's also a different audience and a different set of objectives. If you look at the legislation - the legislation in Idaho, for example, that you bring up is quite good. It really just says, very simply, public schools in the state of Idaho cannot compel students to believe that any race is inherently superior or inferior, that anyone should be treated differently on the basis of race, or that any race is inherently oppressive or collectively guilty for historical crimes. And again, it's very solid compelled speech grounds that protects students' First Amendment rights, that isn't overly broad. I think it's one of the best state bills. And I find it so strange and almost inexplicable that anyone who really read the language in the bill - should we be compelling students to personally believe that one race is superior to another?\n\nI think that this all gets into how these laws are interpreted, because this is a part of a series of pieces of legislation. For instance, in Tennessee, it is illegal for teachers to include any material that promotes division between or resentment of a race, sex, religion, creed non-violent political affiliation, social class, or class of people - which we can all recognize, because we are all sensible people, that that could be interpreted in any number of ways. Like, how do we engage with this? I'm concerned because I think that this legislation is based in some ways on feelings and how people interpret this information. Rick, do you see a harm? Am I crazy? What's going on here?\n\nYeah, I think there is a harm to the legislation. I mean, if you're trying to target the issues that undermine achievement and shortchange students, this would not be the place to start, right? There'd be lots of other legislation that has to deal with funding, and how well teachers are trained and so forth, that might improve children's education. But one effect of this legislation, which I worry about, actually, is that what we really need in classrooms is we need the very best educators in the world. That's what we need for our nation to thrive. People who are really good educators, they are professionals who want to act autonomously and to be able to exercise their professional discretion and make their own decisions about how they teach and how they do what they do, just as doctors want to be able to make decisions about how they treat patients, right? So there may be a way where having a legislature, which actually doesn't really know much about education, come in and start to mandate what can and cannot happen - that actually is going to turn off the very people that we should be trying to attract to education, because those are the people that can help children learn.\n\nBut isn't that already the status quo? I mean, in every state in the United States, the state legislature mandates the curriculum. The state legislature funds public schools. The state legislature determines what is included and excluded in the classroom. In many cases, these bills are one or two pages. It's a very small addition to provide extra clarity, just to say very simply -\n\nYes and no there, in terms of state control. Right, so the state does mandate that students should understand - if you're taking physics, right, there's a curriculum for physics, or for chemistry. But in terms of whether the teacher performs a certain experiment in chemistry, or another experiment in chemistry, or highlights one aspect or another, that's left to the teacher's discretion to figure out how to promote knowledge of chemistry and of the scientific method among students. And this legislation that we're seeing in some of these states is so broad that it's hard for me to describe it other than it's meant to terrorize and instill fear in people, that if they say the wrong thing, some horrible consequence is going to happen.\n\nI mean, I think this all has to do in many ways with our interpretations. Chris, you've talked about the education that you had, that was, in your own telling, very broad and very deep - talking about slavery and Jim Crow and the use of redlining. And at no point, I assume, did that cause you to hate America.\n\nAnd this is what, to me, the debate is really about - is who has authority over public institutions. Is it the bureaucracy? Is it teachers unions? Is it outside diversity training firms that are able to circumvent the democratic process, to circumvent public will, and implement a curriculum really outside of that process? Or is it voters, through their state legislators, and also voters and the public through their school boards? And to me, this is a kind of very basic democratic function, where you're saying public institutions and the values that they transmit are determined by the public through their state legislatures.\n\nBut you're also involved in helping to influence both the public and the state legislatures. Correct?\n\nOf course. Yeah, I mean, that's again, how the public process works. Public persuasion in support of certain desired outcomes, rallying voters - ultimately, people can listen to me or not listen to me, just as the same with everyone. But if you can rally the public through public persuasion, and then you have the votes, you have the public pressure, and you have the attention of legislators, you can get things done. I don't see anything out of the ordinary with that.\n\nHow much do you think fear plays into this, Rick?\n\nThere are two major developments. One is we have this extraordinary demographic change as a result of immigration and other factors. So we have a demographic change. And then we also have growing economic inequality, which breeds widespread economic anxiety. And that's abetted by technological advances which are going to dramatically remake lots of different industries. And people are worried about their future and the future of their children. So when people are so worried and when they're feeling that their group is becoming marginalized, or might no longer be dominant, it's only natural to act with some desperation to try to hold on to what has been. And I think that is part of what's going on here, because so many of these legislative responses seem to be, in a sense, solutions in search of a problem. Do we know what the effect on student achievement would be if we were to introduce more discussion of race into the curriculum? As far as I know, no. We don't have the answer to that. When I was a child growing up, I could imagine that for me and my peers, we might have been well served educationally if we had some information that would help us answer the question of, well, why do all the Black people live in this part of the city rather than that part of the city. Why is it that the schools that the White kids go to actually seem to be newer than the schools that the Black kids go to? Why does my father have this job as a laborer where some other white kids' father has some job that seems to pay a lot more. It might be that if you could give kids a way to help make - especially disadvantaged kids - a way to make sense of their world in a way that doesn't cause them to internalize all the bad messages in society, it might be that their academic achievement would improve as a result of changes in curricular materials. I think we should at least see that as an open question.\n\nThose are valid questions. I think by the time kids are in high school, that's probably the right age to be asking some of those deeper and more complex questions. I'd have no problem with that. None of the state laws would prohibit that kind of discussion. But I think there's two points. First, the reason, perhaps, that you haven't seen it in your time with your kids is that this is all very new. But I think a second and more important point - and I think a really foundational point - is that opposition to critical race theory in public schools isn't a racial issue, isn't, I think as you might have been suggesting, a response to changing demographics, a kind of white resentment. I don't think it's that at all. This is a really broadly multi-ethnic opposition. The argument has been from the political left that this fight against critical race theory is driven by resentful white conservatives that are anxious about the changing demographics of society and losing their social status, when in fact, that's not true.\n\nChris, you brought it up on Fox News, which then got the attention of then President Trump - but then brought this to the mainstream. And so this is something, like - whether or not you wanted it to be a part of partisan politics, well, partisan politics just happened to you.\n\nWe have a partisan political system. That's how we decide what happens in our country. That's how our political system functions. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. What I'm saying is that even with the partisan political environment, even with Fox News opposing critical race theory and MSNBC defending critical race theory, the case that I've made with my colleagues has been successful in persuading voters that, quote, critical race theory is a kind of pernicious ideology in our education system that divides people rather than unites people. The case that has been made over the last year, I think it is shifting against critical race theory. And my contention is that the more that people find out what's really at heart of this ideology, the more they oppose it.\n\nRick, I want to go to you for the last word, because I think Chris and I - I feel as if we have reached a disagreement impasse. And I'm curious, Rick, how should we teach this? How should we teach this- the American story of race and racism?\n\nWell, I think we want the best teachers we can possibly find. And we need to really do everything we can to give them the autonomy, to devise curricular materials that they think are good. Second point is that the longstanding problem in our society has not been that we focus too much on race, but that we focus too little on race, and that we have been unwilling to recognize the centrality of race in American society. So in teaching American history, you should tell that story. What we should not do - and I agree with Chris on this point - is we should not make people feel bad about their identities. We should not stigmatize people. We should not try to indoctrinate children by telling them what to think about contentious issues in society, especially young children. So I think we agree on that. But I do worry that this whole debate about critical race theory is an example of our public discourse and the ways in which our public discourse is lacking, which is that people are forming strong opinions about issues that they don't really know that much about. They're not really staying in their lane. They're trying to express opinions that should really be the domain of professional educators. We don't have much respect for the educators or give them enough leeway. And through it all- and I agree with Chris on this point - the kids who lose are really the disadvantaged students in our nation's most impoverished areas who are disproportionately Black and brown. And those kids are the ones who are losing out, but they've been losing out long before people ever started talking about intersectionality or white fragility. And I hope- and I know we share the hope that we can do right by the children in our society, because we are not going to thrive as a nation unless we can put aside all these adult squabbles and all these ideological inclinations and figure out what we need to do to make opportunities as universal as talent.\n\nThank you both for your time.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nChris Rufo is a senior fellow and director of the initiative on critical race theory at the Manhattan Institute. Ralph Richard Banks is a law professor and co-founder and faculty director of the Stanford Center for Racial Justice.\n\nThere is absolutely no shortage of stuff to read about critical race theory. Some of the things I recommend are Jean Stefancic and Richard Delgado's seminal work, Critical Race Theory: An Introduction.

Better question, should it be?\n\nIf you turn on cable news, there's a good chance you'll catch a segment on the biggest issue said to be threatening students these days - not COVID, nor unequal facilities, or guns, but critical race theory.\n\nIt's the academic theory that race and racism aren't just about individual actors and actions. Critical race theory looks at the inner workings of bigger structures that foment and maintain gaps between different racial groups. In short, racism isn't always burning crosses and using racial slurs. It's a normalized, systemic effort. Critical race theory got its start in the world of law.

But my take is maybe one you haven't heard. I think it would be pretty OK if people used critical race theory to talk about race and racism in schools, but based on some of the lesson plans I'm hearing about, that seems to be more about making white people feel bad than removing structural barriers to equal opportunity. I don't think that's what's happening. One of the most prominent voices against so-called critical race theory in education is Chris Rufo. He first mentioned the idea on Tucker Carlson almost a year ago. Now, one of his main jobs is leading the charge against critical race theory. He's a senior fellow and director of the Initiative on Critical Race Theory at the Manhattan Institute. And he's one of my guests today. My other guest Rick Banks, researches race and law, and strongly disagrees with Chris - and maybe with me. He's a law professor and co-founder and faculty director of the Stanford Center for Racial Justice. I think we're going to have some disagreements on this episode.\n\nChris Rufo and Professor Banks, thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it.\n\nIt's great to be with you.\n\nIt's a pleasure, I've been looking forward to it.\n\nExcellent, I have also. So Rick, I want to start with you. What is critical race theory?\n\nWell, the idea of critical race theory has mutated, so that now I'm not sure what it means. Critical race theory as I know it originated within the legal academy, among law professors in particular. And more specifically, Derrick Bell was a central figure in the development of critical race theory. And what critical race theory was was a response to what we can describe as the failures of civil rights reforms. In other words, it was an attempt to answer the question of - once we've ended slavery and we had Reconstruction, and then we had a Civil Rights Era, and then we passed a lot of legislation, and then the Supreme Court invalidated segregation - once we had all of that happen, why did racial equality not result? And so critical race theory is a way to answer that question. And it answers that question by reference to the centrality of race in the formulation of law and in the effects of laws. A really simple way to think about this question is to - say, if the Supreme Court invalidated de jure segregation in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, how is it that a full decade later, the Black kids were still in segregated schools? Critical race theory attempts to answer that question. The debate that we're having now in society, I don't really see it as about critical race theory per se. We have laws that are being passed that prohibit the teaching of critical race theory in elementary schools or middle schools or high schools, but I've never encountered - as a parent of three children, I've never encountered critical race theory being taught in elementary or middle school, or high school, even. So that's not really about critical race theory. That's kind of really a broader question about how do we want to teach about and think about race in American society.\n\nWhich we are going to get to. Chris, what was the origin of your concern about critical race theory - because when I first heard of you, it was because you went to the White House under the Trump administration and attended meetings. And you tweeted about how critical race theory was the focus. And in the New Yorker profile that you had, you said that critical race theory is the perfect villain, because its connotations are negative to most middle class Americans. It's academic, divisive, poisonous, elitist, and anti-American. So where did - how did you get into this, and where did that come from?\n\nWell, I think first we should take a step back. And I think there are really two critical race theories we're talking about. Professor Banks outlines, really, the idea of critical race theory in the legal academy in 1989. But critical race theory is a critical theory, which means that it operates dialectically, which means that it's constantly changing and mutating and progressing. And critical race theory - although, absolutely, it started at Harvard Law School, at other elite legal institutions, has moved dialectically and extended its territory. You can even read in Critical Race Theory: An Introduction that the critical race theories themselves say in many ways they've been more successful in implementing their ideas in the educational system than in the legal system. There's now a huge body of evidence - critical pedagogy, culturally responsive teaching, et cetera. There are these massive, 400 page textbooks called things like Critical Race Theory And Education where they're taking the ideas and the theories. And then, like all critical theories, applying them through the praxis, or practice, to education. And even just down the street from Professor Banks in Cupertino, California, not too far from Stanford Law School, they were teaching intersectionality, which is a key component of critical race theory, to third graders, forcing them to deconstruct their racial identities. In class, according to their, quote, power and privilege. This is -\n\nI want to jump in very quickly. I would say that critical race theory has shifted and changed, because I think that that is what a theory would do in response to new ideas and new evidence. I spoke with Kimberle Crenshaw, a couple of years ago. She's the person who came up with the concept of intersectionality as part of critical race theory. And it basically argues that people's identities intersect - for instance, I am a Black woman, so I experience the experiences of being Black, but also the experiences of being a woman and the culmination of that is that I have experiences that my dad might not have as a Black man and my mom might not have as a white woman. Kimberle Crenshaw wrote a paper at the University of Chicago in the late 1980s. And when I've had folks who disagree with intersectionality as it's practiced read that paper, they're like, well, that seems sensible. And it seems to me, Chris, that what you're saying, in some ways - and I don't want to put words in your mouth - is that there is the critical race theory that's the legal academy that Rick just brought up. And then there is critical race theory, the practice that you see in schools. Is that what you're saying? I just want to be clear here.\n\nYeah, I think that's right. I mean, the summary that Rick laid out I think was accurate in my reading. I think those are all really valuable questions. I think those are really key questions. But as you've said the, critical race praxis, the component of the critical theory that is supposed to be applied - and you have to remember that a critical theory is distinguished from a traditional theory, because its goal is not merely to observe the world to reveal the truth, but to actually change the world. Therefore, you have to measure it not only in abstract terms in academic terms, but you actually have to look - well, what is it doing to society? What is it doing in classrooms? What is its impact in practice? And the reason I'm bringing up the example in Cupertino, for example, is really to say it's not only false that critical race theory hasn't made its way into classrooms. I have dozens of stories about it. So I think we need to come up with - either we debate them separately, we talk about them separately, or we talk about them together. But the idea that critical race theory isn't in schools. I think is a myth and not supported by the evidence.\n\nBut I do want to note kids exist in a context. They are aware that they are going to school, probably - either with kids who look very different from them or in a lot of schools in America, still, with kids who very much look exactly the same as they do. And they may go to one school while all the white kids go to this different school, and they're curious as to why that is. Maybe the question is not necessarily - here are some bad ways to talk about this, but is there a better way to talk about this?\n\nObviously, yeah, I think there is a better way, but I think that there's another kind of bait and switch that I've seen over and over and over from educators, where you come up with an example like forcing third graders to deconstruct their racial identities, or forcing middle school teachers in Springfield, Missouri to locate themselves on an oppression matrix. And then there's people who say, well, that's not real critical race theory. Real critical race theory has never been tried. And yet, there's evidence that is accumulating day by day that when these ideas are applied, they end up with these awful practices that I think all three of us agree should not be in the classroom. So the question - what I think of as critical race theory is not to measure it in the abstract, not to say, well, are the abstract ideas good or bad? We can have a formal debate. But actually, I think the obligation, especially in a school setting, is to measure its success by its practical outcomes. And I don't think that you can separate them. And then whenever I bring up the actual specifics that happen, people back away. My argument would be simply if something is producing negative outcomes or poor practices, maybe the problem is in the theory itself. Maybe the theory that yields bad outcomes is the source of those bad outcomes.\n\nBut there are different strands to this discussion of race in the classroom right. And one strand focuses on identity, and is kind of obsessed with people's individual identities, and intersectionality, and oppression matrices. And I'm not in favor of all of that generally in the classroom, especially for young people. But there's another strand, which just focuses on our ability to tell the truth about American society both past and present. And there, the question is whether the prior situation, where we don't talk about race, whether there are harms that have resulted from that - and I would suggest that there are. And even in my own life, for example, and I say this as a law professor now - I was taught as a child that the Civil War wasn't really about slavery. It was about other stuff. It was about states' rights. And then you flash forward 30 years later, my son is in elementary school in liberal, progressive California. And he's taught about the end of slavery, and Abraham Lincoln as the Great Emancipator, and it was such a wonderful thing. And then he's taught about the Civil Rights era. And he raised a question in his class - well, what happened between slavery and the Civil Rights era. Like, why didn't ending slavery solve all the problems? And the teacher had omitted mention of lynching, omitted mention of the racial terrorism that actually has shaped the history of our family. And none of that appeared in the curriculum. So that's the sort of thing that is, I think, much more common than the examples you're giving, that we have this willful blindness to aspects of history that are uncomfortable, and that undermines our ability to recognize the challenges that we face in a society. Because we continue to reside within this sort of happy story about progress and freedom and equality and liberty, and to not recognize some of the complications of the story. And ultimately, it actually undermines the goals of education, because what we need children to most take from their schooling is the ability to be critical thinkers - right, and they can't be critical thinkers if we are systematically shielding them from some of the unhappy parts of the story.\n\nI would make two points. I mean, first, I started my kind of public school education in the late 1980s, and then moved forward from there - K through 12 public schools in California. I learned all about the history of slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, Native American genocide, the Black Codes, et cetera. And I think that's important. I think that's foundational. You have to be taking an honest look at history, a hard look at history, including those enormous injustices. I think that's probably pretty standard. I think if you looked at the K through 12 school curriculum today in 2021 that you would find all of those as part of the history. I think that's good. But you can do that without critical race theory. I think there's another mutation in the rhetoric where when people say we don't like intersectionality, we don't like deconstructing identities, all of those buzzwords that seem to be creeping into the public education system - we just want to teach honest history. And I think that those are separate things. For example, I had what I think is a kind of comprehensive history of racial injustice in American public schools without critical race theory.\n\nYou had an extraordinary education, because I've taught law students here at Stanford Law School who are flabbergasted to learn that racially restrictive covenants were used in Northern California to restrict who could live where. Students arrived at law school and they are unaware of these very basic legal devices - racially restrictive covenants, which typically would bar entry to certain races. And this has shaped our entire nation. And most people actually don't know about that. So it's - I find it hard to believe that they're being taught about that in high school.\n\nAre there people advocating very strongly for critical race theory to be taught in schools, or is it mostly people advocating against it?\n\nWell, I think there's both. The people who are advocating very strongly for critical race theory in K through 12 education are teachers' unions. The NEA, the largest teachers' union in the country, just this summer endorsed critical race theory at their annual convention. The public school bureaucracies are also very much in favor. In many cases, not in all cases, but in many cases programs, of kind of diversity, equity, and inclusion include some of these tenets of critical race theory. And again, even in Professor Banks' kind of home area, Santa Clara County, the Office of Education has strongly endorsed critical race theory among - amidst, included, in their ethnic studies program, in which they denounced the United States as a, quote, parasitic system based on the invasion of settlers. And they're encouraging teachers to, quote, cash in on kids' inherent empathy in order to radicalize them into critical pedagogies and the kind of Freirean notion of revolution.\n\nI'm not aware of these particular expressions of this commitment that you're talking about.\n\nChris, you've been very involved in legislation that is attempting to remove this.\n\nYes. This is how I think about this, and so this is what informs my views. I spent years directing a documentary for PBS, public television, in and out of a public housing project in Memphis, Tennessee in the 38126 ZIP code. And I kind of often find myself reflecting on that experience, reflecting on the thousands of conversations I had, all of the research that I did, all of the people that I met. And then finding there's such an enormous gap between what people told me where their real life concerns in South Memphis, the things that really impacted their life. And clearly, in South Memphis, it's that top of the Mississippi Delta. You can feel the legacy of slavery, segregation, institutionalized racism. You can see it, almost. It's palpable. So no one would deny or even minimize that. But then the solutions that come from critical race theory are - what I think are elite driven and elite serving solutions. They are things that are very good for Robin DeAngelo selling seminars and Ibram Kendi also making children's books and self-help manuals, but don't actually solve the problems for the people that I know and met and really admire and care for in South Memphis.\n\nThanks for that, Chris, but let me offer an alternative interpretation, though, which is that the villain here is actually not critical race theory. The villain is actually the set of conditions and the tendencies that gave rise to critical race theory. Right - so for example, we have always been unwilling to address the intertwining of race and class in American society. We've been unwilling to actually commit to do the things that would bring forth a true racial equality. When Brown v. Board of Education was decided, for example, in 1954, the court said you can't bar or require students to go to racially segregated schools. And it pretty much stopped there, right? And the court declined to do any of a gazillion other things that might have helped to produce racially integrated schools, or that might have helped to create more equitable or more effective education nationwide. So the problem that we have in society, I think is really that we want to imagine that if we make some small tweaks around the edges, that will produce change. But it rarely does, and that's why race continues to be the problem that it is in American society. So we all have incentives to take the easy way out rather than do the hard work of racial justice, but that's not because of critical race theory. Critical race theory is really meant to illuminate that tendency in all of us so that hopefully we can do better. [MUSIC PLAYING]\n\nWe're still collecting your anecdotes for a future COVID related episode. Have you successfully convinced a vaccine hesitant person in your life to get the COVID vaccine? Tell me about it in a voicemail by calling 347-915-4324. We might play an excerpt of it on a future episode.\n\nThere is a common issue here of, like, yes, the performative act of anti-racism has markedly little to do with anti-racism. You haven't eliminated disparities that I witness all the time. That problem, I don't think, would be eradicated by banning critical race theory.\n\nThose are kind of two separate problems, right? So if you want to look at the problem - I think the three of us are in agreement on the problem. And I'll give you an example that illustrates it. Buffalo public schools in New York - I did a long report on Buffalo. This is a public school district that has, by 5th grade, only 20% of students are proficient in math and 18% are proficient in reading. I mean this is a human tragedy. It's a disaster. This is something that should be sending red alarms through our society. But instead of reforming itself, the public school bureaucracy in Buffalo has adopted a, quote, Black Lives Matter curriculum that teaches that really the solution is to disrupt the Western nuclear family, to create queer affirming spaces, to dismantle cis gender privilege, et cetera, et cetera - the kind of catch phrases of popular critical race theory ideology. But the question that I think both of you are asking and I'm asking is, what does this do for the kids who can't read by the end of elementary school?\n\nI think we actually agree on that. I think we actually agree that that doesn't help the kids who can't read.\n\nYeah, that seems less about, like, critical race theory. I want to get to some of the legislation that you've been working on. You're director of initiatives on critical race theory at the Manhattan Institute. So Chris, you've got some stakes in the game here. But I want to get into some of the language you've used with regard to wins on this. For instance, an Idaho bill H0377. And you said last year on Tucker Carlson, I declared a one man war against critical race theory in public institutions. Today, we have built an army of families, parents, writers, lawyers, activists, and legislators, fighting together to defeat this divisive and anti-American ideology. I want to get to - because that seems that sounds, I mean, I know we all talk differently to different people. But that sounds very different from your critiques of how this looks in a system where not enough kids are getting up to grade level in reading. That sounds to me about an argument about - not whether or not critical race theory is effective, or this interpretation I should say, of critical race theory, but that it's divisive and anti-American.\n\nFirst of all, when you're on cable television, unfortunately, you have two minutes to make your case. It's also a different audience and a different set of objectives. If you look at the legislation - the legislation in Idaho, for example, that you bring up is quite good. It really just says, very simply, public schools in the state of Idaho cannot compel students to believe that any race is inherently superior or inferior, that anyone should be treated differently on the basis of race, or that any race is inherently oppressive or collectively guilty for historical crimes. And again, it's very solid compelled speech grounds that protects students' First Amendment rights, that isn't overly broad. I think it's one of the best state bills. And I find it so strange and almost inexplicable that anyone who really read the language in the bill - should we be compelling students to personally believe that one race is superior to another?\n\nI think that this all gets into how these laws are interpreted, because this is a part of a series of pieces of legislation. For instance, in Tennessee, it is illegal for teachers to include any material that promotes division between or resentment of a race, sex, religion, creed non-violent political affiliation, social class, or class of people - which we can all recognize, because we are all sensible people, that that could be interpreted in any number of ways. Like, how do we engage with this? I'm concerned because I think that this legislation is based in some ways on feelings and how people interpret this information. Rick, do you see a harm? Am I crazy? What's going on here?\n\nYeah, I think there is a harm to the legislation. I mean, if you're trying to target the issues that undermine achievement and shortchange students, this would not be the place to start, right? There'd be lots of other legislation that has to deal with funding, and how well teachers are trained and so forth, that might improve children's education. But one effect of this legislation, which I worry about, actually, is that what we really need in classrooms is we need the very best educators in the world. That's what we need for our nation to thrive. People who are really good educators, they are professionals who want to act autonomously and to be able to exercise their professional discretion and make their own decisions about how they teach and how they do what they do, just as doctors want to be able to make decisions about how they treat patients, right? So there may be a way where having a legislature, which actually doesn't really know much about education, come in and start to mandate what can and cannot happen - that actually is going to turn off the very people that we should be trying to attract to education, because those are the people that can help children learn.\n\nBut isn't that already the status quo? I mean, in every state in the United States, the state legislature mandates the curriculum. The state legislature funds public schools. The state legislature determines what is included and excluded in the classroom. In many cases, these bills are one or two pages. It's a very small addition to provide extra clarity, just to say very simply -\n\nYes and no there, in terms of state control. Right, so the state does mandate that students should understand - if you're taking physics, right, there's a curriculum for physics, or for chemistry. But in terms of whether the teacher performs a certain experiment in chemistry, or another experiment in chemistry, or highlights one aspect or another, that's left to the teacher's discretion to figure out how to promote knowledge of chemistry and of the scientific method among students. And this legislation that we're seeing in some of these states is so broad that it's hard for me to describe it other than it's meant to terrorize and instill fear in people, that if they say the wrong thing, some horrible consequence is going to happen.\n\nI mean, I think this all has to do in many ways with our interpretations. Chris, you've talked about the education that you had, that was, in your own telling, very broad and very deep - talking about slavery and Jim Crow and the use of redlining. And at no point, I assume, did that cause you to hate America.\n\nAnd this is what, to me, the debate is really about - is who has authority over public institutions. Is it the bureaucracy? Is it teachers unions? Is it outside diversity training firms that are able to circumvent the democratic process, to circumvent public will, and implement a curriculum really outside of that process? Or is it voters, through their state legislators, and also voters and the public through their school boards? And to me, this is a kind of very basic democratic function, where you're saying public institutions and the values that they transmit are determined by the public through their state legislatures.\n\nBut you're also involved in helping to influence both the public and the state legislatures. Correct?\n\nOf course. Yeah, I mean, that's again, how the public process works. Public persuasion in support of certain desired outcomes, rallying voters - ultimately, people can listen to me or not listen to me, just as the same with everyone. But if you can rally the public through public persuasion, and then you have the votes, you have the public pressure, and you have the attention of legislators, you can get things done. I don't see anything out of the ordinary with that.\n\nHow much do you think fear plays into this, Rick?\n\nThere are two major developments. One is we have this extraordinary demographic change as a result of immigration and other factors. So we have a demographic change. And then we also have growing economic inequality, which breeds widespread economic anxiety. And that's abetted by technological advances which are going to dramatically remake lots of different industries. And people are worried about their future and the future of their children. So when people are so worried and when they're feeling that their group is becoming marginalized, or might no longer be dominant, it's only natural to act with some desperation to try to hold on to what has been. And I think that is part of what's going on here, because so many of these legislative responses seem to be, in a sense, solutions in search of a problem. Do we know what the effect on student achievement would be if we were to introduce more discussion of race into the curriculum? As far as I know, no. We don't have the answer to that. When I was a child growing up, I could imagine that for me and my peers, we might have been well served educationally if we had some information that would help us answer the question of, well, why do all the Black people live in this part of the city rather than that part of the city. Why is it that the schools that the White kids go to actually seem to be newer than the schools that the Black kids go to? Why does my father have this job as a laborer where some other white kids' father has some job that seems to pay a lot more. It might be that if you could give kids a way to help make - especially disadvantaged kids - a way to make sense of their world in a way that doesn't cause them to internalize all the bad messages in society, it might be that their academic achievement would improve as a result of changes in curricular materials. I think we should at least see that as an open question.\n\nThose are valid questions. I think by the time kids are in high school, that's probably the right age to be asking some of those deeper and more complex questions. I'd have no problem with that. None of the state laws would prohibit that kind of discussion. But I think there's two points. First, the reason, perhaps, that you haven't seen it in your time with your kids is that this is all very new. But I think a second and more important point - and I think a really foundational point - is that opposition to critical race theory in public schools isn't a racial issue, isn't, I think as you might have been suggesting, a response to changing demographics, a kind of white resentment. I don't think it's that at all. This is a really broadly multi-ethnic opposition. The argument has been from the political left that this fight against critical race theory is driven by resentful white conservatives that are anxious about the changing demographics of society and losing their social status, when in fact, that's not true.\n\nChris, you brought it up on Fox News, which then got the attention of then President Trump - but then brought this to the mainstream. And so this is something, like - whether or not you wanted it to be a part of partisan politics, well, partisan politics just happened to you.\n\nWe have a partisan political system. That's how we decide what happens in our country. That's how our political system functions. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. What I'm saying is that even with the partisan political environment, even with Fox News opposing critical race theory and MSNBC defending critical race theory, the case that I've made with my colleagues has been successful in persuading voters that, quote, critical race theory is a kind of pernicious ideology in our education system that divides people rather than unites people. The case that has been made over the last year, I think it is shifting against critical race theory. And my contention is that the more that people find out what's really at heart of this ideology, the more they oppose it.\n\nRick, I want to go to you for the last word, because I think Chris and I - I feel as if we have reached a disagreement impasse. And I'm curious, Rick, how should we teach this? How should we teach this- the American story of race and racism?\n\nWell, I think we want the best teachers we can possibly find. And we need to really do everything we can to give them the autonomy, to devise curricular materials that they think are good. Second point is that the longstanding problem in our society has not been that we focus too much on race, but that we focus too little on race, and that we have been unwilling to recognize the centrality of race in American society. So in teaching American history, you should tell that story. What we should not do - and I agree with Chris on this point - is we should not make people feel bad about their identities. We should not stigmatize people. We should not try to indoctrinate children by telling them what to think about contentious issues in society, especially young children. So I think we agree on that. But I do worry that this whole debate about critical race theory is an example of our public discourse and the ways in which our public discourse is lacking, which is that people are forming strong opinions about issues that they don't really know that much about. They're not really staying in their lane. They're trying to express opinions that should really be the domain of professional educators. We don't have much respect for the educators or give them enough leeway. And through it all- and I agree with Chris on this point - the kids who lose are really the disadvantaged students in our nation's most impoverished areas who are disproportionately Black and brown. And those kids are the ones who are losing out, but they've been losing out long before people ever started talking about intersectionality or white fragility. And I hope- and I know we share the hope that we can do right by the children in our society, because we are not going to thrive as a nation unless we can put aside all these adult squabbles and all these ideological inclinations and figure out what we need to do to make opportunities as universal as talent.\n\nThank you both for your time.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nChris Rufo is a senior fellow and director of the initiative on critical race theory at the Manhattan Institute.

After Oklahoma's G.O.P. governor signed his state's version in early May, he was ousted from the centennial commission for the 1921 Race Massacre in Tulsa, which President Biden visited on Tuesday to memorialize one of the worst episodes of racial violence in U.S. history.\n\nFrom school boards to the halls of Congress, Republicans are mounting an energetic campaign aiming to dictate how historical and modern racism in America are taught, meeting pushback from Democrats and educators in a politically thorny clash that has deep ramifications for how children learn about their country.\n\nRepublicans have focused their attacks on the influence of \" critical race theory, \" a graduate school framework that has found its way into K-12 public education. The concept argues that historical patterns of racism are ingrained in law and other modern institutions, and that the legacies of slavery, segregation and Jim Crow still create an uneven playing field for Black people and other people of color.\n\nMany conservatives portray critical race theory and invocations of systemic racism as a gauntlet thrown down to accuse white Americans of being individually racist. Republicans accuse the left of trying to indoctrinate children with the belief that the United States is inherently wicked.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Critical Race Theory Is a Convenient Target for Conservatives\n\nListen to A Word ... With Jason Johnson:\n\nAcross the country, Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis are fighting against critical race theory, even if they don't know what it is. Professor Ibram X. Kendi joined us on Friday's episode of A Word to explain critical race theory, so even racists can understand. He's the author of How to Be an Antiracist and the director of the Boston University Center for Antiracist Research. He's also the host of a new podcast, Be Antiracist With Ibram X. Kendi . Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nJason Johnson: Dr. Kendi, in your mind, what actually is critical race theory and why do you think Republicans and so many people are so in a kerfuffle about it now?\n\nIbram X. Kendi: Critical race theory emerged among lawyers and legal scholars who recognized that despite being in this post-civil rights America, racial inequity and disparity still existed and persisted. For them and for critical race theorists, the aim was to examine those structures, those laws, those policies, so that we can uncover the structures of racism. And obviously, critical race theory has extended out to other disciplines. Personally, I think that Republicans specifically chose to attack critical race theory because they felt that they could define it more easily than other terms. Since they couldn't come out and say, \"Oh, those people who are challenging systemic racism are a problem.\" They couldn't say, \"Those anti-racists are a problem.\" So they're defining critical race theory at the same time they are attacking it, and critical race theorists are like, \"That's not how we define it.\"\n\nWhat is the most troubling thing politicians and the media have gotten wrong about critical race theory?\n\nWow. Man, there's so many. I would probably say the misconception that critical race theory is a theory that seeks to attack white people, as opposed to it is a theory and an intellectual tradition that seeks to attack structural racism. If you're white and you're being told by elected officials, or even the media, that critical race theories are out to go after white people, then I could understand how people would be concerned about that, but it's a very different thing when critical race theorists are focused on challenging structural racism. I think that's been very troubling.\n\nWould you consider yourself to be a critical race theorist? Who are critical race theorists out there that people should be aware of?\n\nI've certainly been inspired by critical race theory and critical race theorists. The ways in which I've formulated definitions of racism and racist and anti-racism and anti-racist have not only been based on historical evidence, but also Kimberlé Crenshaw's intersectional theory. She's one of the founding and pioneering critical race theorists who in the late 1980s and early 1990s said, \"You know what? Black women aren't just facing racism, they're not just facing sexism, they're facing the intersection of racism and sexism.\" It's important for us to understand that and that's foundational to my work.\n\nLet's talk a little bit about academic pushback. There've been some academics who have been critical of some of your work, including How to Be an Antiracist . Some people have said, \"Oh, it kind of lets white America off the hook.\" Have you found yourself at the nexus of these conversations? Or is it more something where people are debating two sides of the same coin as opposed to questioning the legitimacy of what you're working on?\n\nOne of the beauties of being an academic is being able to engage in intellectual exchanges and those intellectual exchanges should be based on our consumption of other people's work. To be honest, Jason, I've been most frustrated when I see and hear people, including academics, criticize my work when their criticisms demonstrate they actually haven't engaged my work or read my work; they just have heard what somebody else has said. I'm sure any writer, and I'm sure those critics themselves, would be frustrated if they're being critiqued for something they actually didn't say or didn't believe.\n\nOne thing I will say I have focused on more, and I've really highlighted, and I wish I would have described this better within How to Be an Antiracist , is that we tend to use the terms racism and racist interchangeably. I even did that in How to Be an Antiracist while at the same time I was trying to define them differently. We're just so used to using those terms interchangeably, and so what I've done since then, is I've been very open that it's important to understand racism as structural, as systemic, as institutional, but the term racist is a term of individuality. So we're really talking about an individual person, an individual idea, an individual policy, an individual nation. I'm happy because the conversation around my book has allowed me to really ensure that we're not using those terms interchangeably and we have different definitions for those two terms.\n\nI want to talk about Nikole Hannah-Jones . This is a situation where conservative forces use their money and resources to go after a Pulitzer Prize winner, a MacArthur \"Genius Grant\" recipient, the author of the 1619 Project, and deny her full tenure with her position at UNC-Chapel Hill. My question for you was, one, how would we define those particular attacks as either racist or racism? Because the critics say, \"Oh, no, no, no, this is purely because of academic reasons.\" And then second, as you've heard about this story, does it make you, as a scholar, worry about the future of academic freedom at colleges around the country?\n\nSo the attacks, whether it's individual members of the board of trustees or the board of trustees collectively, or even those who are defending those trustees for not providing this incredibly talented and qualified journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones tenure, those were individual attacks, and therefore, racist attacks. Then when we take a step back and we look at UNC, or we look at the nation and we see that Black women with tenure are rare, that's a function of a system or structure that is leading to that sort of disparity.\n\nAre you optimistic that we can overcome these attacks on critical race theory, that we can overcome these attacks on voter suppression? Do you think that our current government and leadership is up to the task?\n\nSo I do think the Democratic Party is still captive to trying to attract white swing voters who they believe do not want to have serious discussions about the ways in which our nation is racist or about just how pervasive structural racism is. Then you have the Republican Party, obviously, that imagines that structural racism doesn't exist. So you put that together, and unfortunately, we have these two forces or major political forces, neither of which want to have these serious conversations. On the other hand, if you compare 2021 to 1921 or 1821, there are many people who are committed to creating a different type of nation in extremely important and powerful positions, and they just were not there in 1921. We do have these journalists and scholars, and even elected officials and activists, who are in key positions and are in key powerful positions, and their commitment gives me hope.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "What the Critical Race Theory Panic Was Really About (and the Data to Prove It)\n\nWhen, this past spring, a succession of stories about communities pushing back, angrily, against the supposed teaching of critical race theory in their school districts began to overtake my social media feeds, I had a hunch that it was a direct result of white fear . But a recent data analysis from NBC News confirms it.\n\nReporters found that the districts hosting some of the most combative debates over diversity and inclusion initiatives-including just teaching about racism-have seen a steady increase in students of color attending their schools. In Gwinnett County, Georgia, where parents have squared off over critical race theory, there has been a 52.4 percent increase in students of color since 1994. And in Loudoun County, Virginia, where the rights of transgender students and teaching racism have become ugly, loud battleground issues, there has been a 29.5 percent increase in that span of time.\n\nIf you've been following how whiteness has evolved since the 2016 election, this isn't surprising . But it is nice to have the numbers to back it up. It reminded one of my colleagues of a similar, equally unsurprising yet very real finding following the Capitol riot. Political scientist Robert Pape, after going through polling and demographic data, discovered that most people who participated in the riots came to D.C. from places where residents were terrified of being replaced by people of color and immigrants. More specifically, as the New York Times put it , \"counties with the most significant declines in the non-Hispanic white population are the most likely to produce insurrectionists.\"\n\n\"If you look back in history, there has always been a series of far-right extremist movements responding to new waves of immigration to the United States or to movements for civil rights by minority groups,\" Pape told the New York Times. \"You see a common pattern in the Capitol insurrectionists. They are mainly middle-class to upper-middle-class whites who are worried that, as social changes occur around them, they will see a decline in their status in the future.\"\n\nSimilarly, in response to NBC's findings on the CRT panic, Stanford University professor Tomás Jiménez said, \"In virtually any community, when there is rapid demographic change you see a backlash.\" (Or as one Black mom told NBC of the pushback in her town, \"Folks like me welcome [diversity], and there are a lot of folks who do not feel that way-I think they feel very threatened.\")\n\nThis is all, of course, part of a much larger and longer pattern. During the Reconstruction era, as Black Americans started to get some rights, domestic terror groups like the Ku Klux Klan, Louisiana's White League, and the Knights of the White Camelia organized in order to stop the progress.* In more recent years, the fear stems back to white replacement theory, or \"the great replacement,\" a racist and delusional ideology devised by French writer Renaud Camus asserting that there's a deliberate plot to rid the world of white people. It's popped up during the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville , in tweets from known white supremacist and former lawmaker Steve King, and in manifestos from racist mass shooters -to name a few. As suburbs become more racially diverse, white families are moving out into whiter communities. And, pretty much every immigration law was constructed to keep America as white as possible.\n\nThe NBC News reporting on CRT backlash is important because it makes clear that the fights currently happening in school districts nationwide are an extension of those desperate grasps to maintain power and limit interactions with people of color. Sure, a white parent shouting at a school board meeting because they don't want their child learning the truth about racial inequality isn't as blatant as the violence carried out by the Klan. But it is motivated by the same desire to protect whiteness, its stature, and the privilege it bestows.\n\nCorrection, Sept. 16, 2021: This article originally misidentified the Ku Klux Klan as the Klu Klux Klan.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "\"I Heard We Can't Learn About Black People This Year\"\n\nListen to What Next:\n\nGreg Wickenkamp was working as an eighth grade social studies teacher in Fairfield, Iowa, when he had a very awkward conversation with his boss, the superintendent. He was hoping to talk about this new law that he was struggling to comply with-one of those bills that bans the discussion of \"divisive content.\" Wickenkamp wanted the district to be clear about what \"divisive content\" was. He'd tried emailing the district. That hadn't worked.\n\nGoing into this meeting, things were also coming to a head for Wickenkamp, personally. There had been complaints about how he taught. He used Ibram X. Kendi's anti-racist book Stamped From the Beginning . An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States , too.\n\nFor half an hour, Wickenkamp spars with his boss over the minutiae of how he is being treated. She says she doesn't want to make a big stink about defending him because she thinks that could inflame some families more. And then, with just a few minutes until this meeting is set to expire, Wickenkamp asks this question that it feels like he has been itching to ask: whether it would be acceptable for him to teach his students that slavery is wrong. And his superintendent? She filibusters.\n\n\"I was somewhat surprised because it was so blatantly wishy-washy,\" he said.\n\nI wanted to talk to Greg Wickenkamp, because we are in the middle of an ongoing fight about what can and can't be taught in American schools. The Florida Legislature is considering a ban on discussing menstruation with elementary kids. And a teacher like Wickenkamp? He seems so gently reasonable. Asking: What are we doing here? And why?\n\nOn a recent episode of What Next , we spoke about what can and can't be taught in school these days, and what happened when one teacher tried to find out. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nMary Harris: Why did you choose to teach eighth grade? It's such a hard age. What did you like about teaching adolescents?\n\nGreg Wickenkamp: I really enjoy it, in part because you can have the silly fun that you might have in an elementary school classroom. But then you can also start to go a little deeper in content. The students at that age are really developing their sense of self, and they're able to also look at the world in broader ways than they might have been as younger people. And so I really enjoyed working with students to try to help them think critically and broaden their sense of self and broaden what might be possible in the world and through their lives. And seeing the students learn at that age is really exciting.\n\nWhat did it mean to teach social studies at your school? What kind of subjects were you covering in eighth grade?\n\nWe covered the whole gamut of economics, geography. History was the major focus, but just social sciences generally. And really through that, my intention was to always inspire critical thinking and people who could then engage as citizens in a democracy.\n\nOne of the books you thought did a good job of inspiring critical thinking was that Ibram X. Kendi book Stamped From the Beginning . It explores the history of racism in the U.S. But it also pops up with some regularity on \"anti­-critical race theory\" book-ban lists .\n\nIt's just a really remarkable book-especially the youth adaptation by Jason Reynolds. It is both provocative but also deeply grounded in scholarship and also accessible for young people.\n\nWhat did you want your students to take from it?\n\nI wanted them to start to think critically about race, which is often something, especially in Iowa and the Midwest, that people are hesitant to explore in any critical way.\n\nWere they open to that?\n\nMany students were, and many students were hungry for a deeper understanding because that was lacking generally in K-12 education.\n\nWhen the students weren't open to it, what did that look like?\n\nOftentimes when I would start a unit or lesson the first day, students would be incredibly engaged. And then, after perhaps visiting with their families or something, they might occasionally bring back these biases against the particular content.\n\nSo one student, for example, when we were reading An Indigenous Peoples' History , the youth edition, after a few days he said, \"I'm not going to read any more of this. It just doesn't jibe with my opinion. I believe that blue lives matter, and this text really is more of a Black Lives Matter thing. And that's not for me.\" Which I thought was really strange and a sad commentary on where we're at in society, because the text itself certainly addresses race and colonization and U.S. history, but it doesn't do so from a partisan way.\n\nSo you were feeling these rumblings in the classroom. When did things shift in terms of what you were allowed to teach legally?\n\nThat was in the summer of 2021. Iowa was one of the first amongst many states to pass these anti-CRT laws . That's when things really started to shift dramatically and pushback became even more emboldened.\n\nI immediately sent a letter to the school board saying, \"Hey, this law has passed. I'm really looking for support, as I have been for the last year, about what to teach and whether the district will support that.\" I outlined five or so steps-opportunities, really-that the district could take to get ahead of any pushback that might result from the law.\n\nDid you get any response when you sent that letter?\n\nThe response I got was curious. I got an email from the superintendent, who was admonishing me for going above her and not going directly to her. And then she popped into my class early that fall while I was teaching, which I thought was odd. And she said, \"Hey, I just want you to know: Just stick to the facts, and you'll be fine.\" Which didn't really address any of my concerns or the letter that I had written, but which set the path for the level of support that I received.\n\nIt wasn't because I was confused about the law, which is very vague in Iowa, like many of these laws. And it wasn't because I was confused about what best teaching practices were. It was because I was concerned that the district wouldn't be supportive if tensions ramped up.\n\nI know that this law passed over the summer. So I imagine you were planning your curriculum, getting ready to go back to the classroom. Once you got back to school, what was going on? Were other teachers talking about this now? Were the students?\n\nYeah, they were. In the fall, when I was outlining the class for students, one student in particular said, \"I heard we can't learn about Black people this year,\" which was really striking because the law is vague enough in Iowa that there's all these misinterpretations. Or maybe that's part of the purpose of the law, actually.\n\nSo what did you say to the student?\n\nI said, \"Well, we are learning U.S. history, so of course we will be learning about people of all races. And not only that, but we'll be explicitly exploring race since it's so central to U.S. history, past and present.\"\n\nDid that calm the classroom down, or was there more murmuring after it did?\n\nIt did a little, but I was unsettled by that and emailed the administration, saying, \"Here's what's going on in the classroom. I wanted you to be aware of it. Hopefully we can be a little more proactive in getting ahead of this.\"\n\nWere other teachers doing what you were doing?\n\nTo varying degrees. There were some who really didn't want that level of pushback and so decided that they would just abandon any deep exploration of race, class, or gender. Others said, \"Well, I'll do this, but I'll try to walk the fine line that doesn't draw more attention to myself from those who might want to unfairly impugn my practice.\"\n\nAt one point, a local state legislator singled you out at a public forum. I don't think he used your name, but he identified you enough that it was clear who you were. He basically said you were ignoring state law by using Ibram Kendi's Stamped From the Beginning in your social studies class. What happened there? How did you hear about this?\n\nThat was very challenging. His appeal was really to a QAnon-type crowd. I was very wary of this politician already. So, when he started singling me out very publicly, that was incredibly worrisome. He said in a public forum that what I was doing was indoctrinating students, teaching them to hate America, to hate white people. I was breaking the law. And this was all news to me. I had not received any direct pushback from the district or any politicians about my curriculum. And I would have welcomed a conversation. But it was clear that what he was doing was scapegoating my practice, and he was unrelenting about that.\n\nWere people telling you about these forums?\n\nYeah. It was really weighing heavily on me because I was already in a situation where I was unsure whether the district would be supportive. While this was going on, we were being asked to misgender students and do things that I know are harmful for students. I was already trying to advocate for students in those ways. And so when I caught the public attention of this perception, it was scary. I remember the weekend after the first public forum, the union president called me and said she had heard about what had happened and said, \"We're here for you. Keep protecting yourself. Lock your doors. And if things get too scary, don't hesitate to call 911.\" That was the level of fear that I was having.\n\nThis is all background for that meeting you eventually had with your superintendent, the one where she clearly is unclear about whether you can say slavery is wrong.\n\nRight.\n\nAfter that meeting, my understanding is that the district did try to support you a bit. But what happened there?\n\nAnother school board member, who happened to teach social studies in a neighboring district, was curious about how I was teaching and what I was teaching, so we reviewed that. And sadly, his guidance was that I should \"both sides\" controversial events or give space to not just the North Union during the Civil War and the buildup to it, but space to the Confederacy. And not in a way that necessarily said \"Well, obviously the Confederacy was an error.\" But to say \"Well, some people thought this and other people thought that,\" and he applied this example also to the Holocaust, saying, \"We want to share that many people believe the Holocaust was wrong. But you also want to say, 'Here's why some German people embraced it.' \"\n\nReflecting on that, I followed up with an email. I said, \"These are eighth grade students, and that would be a real disservice to  these young people.\" Of course we want them to form their own judgments. And of course we want to send a broad variety of perspectives. But to imagine that we should or could be neutral on these issues like slavery or the Holocaust is really to the detriment of young people.\n\nYou quit your job at the end of the year last year.\n\nYeah. I didn't renew my contract.\n\nHow did you come to that decision? You sound like you love teaching.\n\nThat was a really hard decision to walk away from K-12, and to recognize that perhaps Iowa is a challenging place to teach for justice, to teach for critical thinking was really, really hard. Teaching is something that I thought long about before entering and thought that that is what I would do until I retire in some way or another. And so to not renew my contract was really, really a hard thing.\n\nMany proponents of laws restricting what's taught in schools, what they say is that children can't grapple with racism. That teaching white kids about racism will make them hate themselves. That teaching not-white kids about racism will make them hate white kids or even feel bad about themselves as well. You taught kids for more than a decade. In your experience, was that true?\n\nNo, not at all. Whether you're explicitly teaching about race or not, you're teaching about race because it's such a fundamental thing to the United States and the world. And so, to remain silent on it just allows whatever prejudices are floating out there, namely white supremacy, to be adopted by many students, to their detriment.\n\nFor example, there's the doll test, where students are asked to identify, among a Black and white doll, which is beautiful and which is good and which is bad. And these are elementary students who are already reflecting racial prejudices and white supremacy. And these tests have been repeated and repeated.\n\nIf students are young enough to reflect the white supremacy of society, they're old enough to learn about it.\n\nOne of the most interesting things about those doll tests is that they found that Black children also prefer the white doll . And that's so important because part of what people misunderstand about an academic like Ibram Kendi is they frame his viewpoints as teaching that white people are bad because they have these beliefs about Black people, when in reality what he's teaching is that we all swim in, like, a racism soup. And we're all absorbing these ideas, so it impacts all of us.\n\nYeah, absolutely. Are we talking about white people or whiteness generally? As a society, many of us don't fully understand that, so people become defensive.\n\nIn the months since you left the classroom, politicians in Iowa have only widened their attacks on public schools in many different ways. In addition to race, there's now a lot of talk about gender and sexuality. Your governor gave this speech where she was characterizing people opposed to her administration. She's a quite conservative Republican. The way she put it was \"They think patriotism is racist, and pornographic library books are education.\"\n\nI wonder how you hear something like that, because it sounds like what you started seeing in 2020, it's only metastasizing.\n\nIt's only growing, and it's scary, and it's sad. I think it reflects this narrow view of what the U.S. is and can be, and this narrow view of patriotism. If we really want to live to our highest ideals, we owe it to students to teach them to think critically about these things.\n\nSince you left the classroom, Iowa legislators have banned gender-affirming care for trans youth. The House has passed a bill that would prohibit the teaching of sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through sixth grade. There's a bill that limits bathroom use in schools to \"biological sex.\" There's curriculum measures that remove the requirement to teach students about HIV , and that's just awaiting the governor's signature. If you were back in the classroom now, would you be able to have the kind of open conversations you want to have with kids?\n\nI don't know. I think it would depend on the district, how supportive they were of all the students, how they interpreted these laws. We're approaching a time when supporting students in these ways is becoming illegal. And I know people with trans kids who are considering leaving the state just because of that, because they want their students to grow up in a safe and supportive environment, which Iowa is becoming less and less.\n\nGet more news from Mary Harris every weekday.\n\nI wonder if you think about your state differently now. I ask that because I think people may have forgotten that Iowa was, like, the third state to legalize same-sex marriage, in 2009.\n\nIowa has a longer tradition of progressive, inclusive politics, going way back. This recent turn is a dangerous direction for Iowans in a lot of ways. And we're seeing it reflected in a variety of ways. The brain drain is talked about a lot.\n\nI'm actually having lunch today with a colleague who quit after death threats and another who felt forced out for advocating around issues of diversity for students. There are a number of teachers who are firmly committed and able to carry on in the classroom and do really good and thoughtful work. And I also know a handful of teachers who have not been able to continue to do that.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "What Florida's \"Critical Race Theory\" Ban Tells Us About Anti-Antiracism\n\nOn Thursday, Florida's State Board of Education voted unanimously, at the behest of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, to ban lessons that employ critical race theory (CRT) or the New York Times' 1619 Project from schools. The vote aligns with initiatives in several other states such as Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Iowa.\n\nFlorida's amendment takes an existing rule saying instruction \"may not suppress or distort significant historical events, such as the Holocaust\" and adds \"slavery, the Civil War and Reconstruction, the civil rights movement and the contributions of women, African American and Hispanic people to our country.\" The new language continues:\n\nExamples of theories that distort historical events and are inconsistent with State Board approved standards include the denial or minimization of the Holocaust, and the teaching of Critical Race Theory, meaning the theory that racism is not merely the product of prejudice, but that racism is embedded in American society and its legal systems in order to uphold the supremacy of white persons. Instruction may not utilize material from the 1619 Project[.]\n\nEven as it bans specific themes and texts, though, Florida's amendment doesn't define exactly which historical or factual claims are off-limits.\n\nCRT is a decades-old set of ideas from the legal academy, which began to be a low-grade source of right-wing panic about racism during the Obama administration . Since the anti-racism protests of 2020 and the end of the Trump administration, though, it has rapidly become an all-purpose term to attack any sort of discussion of the history or current conditions of racial inequity in America.\n\nNothing academically recognizable as critical race theory is currently being taught anywhere in Florida, according to officials who spoke with the Miami Herald. Yet DeSantis has continued his campaign against it anyway, telling reporters last month: \"You teach the facts. You teach everything that has happened. But critical race theory is basically race essentialism. It teaches people to view that as the most important characteristic and obviously, if you are of certain races-Caucasian or whatnot-they view that in a negative light.\"\n\nBy \"essentialism,\" DeSantis is equating the racist theory that people are by nature made unequal according to their race with the anti-racist premise that America's legacy of racism is so ingrained in its legal system and policies that its effects remain inescapable for Black folks and people of color. As reporter Adam Harris noted in The Atlantic, scholars have begun to apply the latter analysis to other areas where inequality is visible, such as housing policy or the role of racism in medicine . What's been gathered-or shoved-under the umbrella of CRT is a burgeoning push to incorporate and prioritize anti-racism in a slew of academic teachings, most prominently the teaching of American history.\n\nAs the Florida law demonstrates, the goal of the anti-CRT effort is put the analysis of ongoing racism out of bounds-to treat any inquiry into the material inequities that define the color line in America as something equivalent to Holocaust denial, and to reframe discussion of ongoing injustice as an insult to \"white persons.\" Other campaigners go as far to equate CRT with Marxism , as if a true accounting of racism in America were somehow going to upend capitalism. Such intentional misreadings allow conservatives to create a dichotomy where considering how racism shaped the country is unpatriotic and anti-American.\n\nThe crusade DeSantis is promoting is one based on generalities-on a vague and all-encompassing political boogeyman. He is operating in the American tradition of conjuring an enemy without grounding it, so it reigns free, amorphous, embodying whomever's worst nightmare. Throughout American history, the political boogeyman has come and gone. It exists currently in conservative panic around critical race theory.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Banning Words Won't Stop Us From Teaching Critical Race Theory\n\nAs laws claiming to target \"critical race theory\" in K-12 schools and public universities move forward in various states, professors like me who teach on race and power in America (disproportionately faculty of color) are caught in the crosshairs. Wisconsin's most recent policy, passed in the State Assembly, lists banned words that include white supremacy , whiteness , equity , multiculturalism , anti-Blackness , and hegemony . But if folks knew more about what critical race theory actually is, they would understand how challenging it would be to eliminate the teaching about racism in everyday life. They'd also understand that banning words will not meaningfully change whether we teach critical race theory (whatever they believe it to be) at all.\n\nI live in the blue state of New Jersey, where I feel protected by state legislation affirming that \"all people should know of and remember the human carnage and dehumanizing atrocities\" of American slavery. But while I don't anticipate that any \"critical race theory\" rules will affect educators here any time soon, the threat still looms over me. Just a year ago, then-President Donald Trump issued an executive order that banned the teaching of \"divisive concepts\" on race in any institution that receives federal funding. Considering the massive expansion of similar state-level policies, the next Republican president will undoubtedly continue the effort to restrict teachers throughout the nation, including university-level educators like me.\n\nAs a professor who teaches on race, media, and politics, I'm comforted by my understanding that the key concepts in critical race theory-more than any particular terms-are what we need to teach students about the ways racial bias manifests. Cheryl Harris' seminal essay \"Whiteness as Property\" explains how whiteness has historically functioned as an asset under American law. Dorothy Roberts' work on the markedly different treatment of drug-addicted Black and white mothers is an intersectional analysis of the criminal justice and child protection systems that shows race to be more of a factor than the actual crime when it comes to legal punishment, incarceration, and family separation. Charles Mills' \"The Racial Contract\" makes us think about how America's social contract with its citizens has created a power structure based on race. These arguments are based on historical law, texts, and evidence. They are rooted in stories about real people, their dreams and their tragic ends. I do not need to use the term whiteness to describe what it is-whiteness and other terms describing race and power in America are simply shorthand for much bigger ideas that I'm confident I'd be able to communicate to my students, even if forced to adhere to anti-CRT language bans.\n\nTake for example colorism , a word on Wisconsin's banned terms list. Colorism means prejudice against people with darker skin tones and preference shown for those with lighter skin tones. Instead of using this word to explain the concept to students, I can talk about the famous \"paper bag test\" principle by which skin color determined admissions to social groups, clubs, and events in the Black community. Or I could analyze the film School Daze with my students. I do not need the phrase land acknowledgment to talk about the Lenape people who lived on the land where my university currently stands or explain what happened to them.  I do not need the phrases restorative justice or structural inequity to tell the stories of Kalief Browder or the Exonerated Five .  Students don't need to hear anti-Blackness to understand the anguish and pain of George Floyd as he died or the police union calling him a violent criminal after his last gasps of air. People who believe that a banned words list can prevent the discussion of American history and culture are people who know neither very well.\n\nThe truth is that these rules take direct aim at the kind of teachers most dedicated and experienced at communicating about race and racism. The teachers who discuss the tragedies and horrors of anti-Blackness, slavery, and genocide in this country are the exceptions, not the rule. They are already well-versed in maneuvering around tone-deaf administrators, poorly informed students, scarce resources, and outdated curricula. They are passionate about their work and intentional about their learning goals. And I expect that they are the teachers most skilled at circumventing and subverting these sorts of policies.\n\nThere is a long history of Americans fighting and sabotaging racist laws, which those well-versed in critical race theory deeply understand. During slavery, Black people learned how to read and teach others to read despite laws against it. They figured out how to memorize and pass messages that helped the North win the Civil War against the Confederacy and sang songs with tips that helped other enslaved people to escape. When cities and towns across the United States refused to fund schools for Black children, their parents donated the funds, building materials, and land to create schoolhouses. Once Black people received the right to vote, they learned to read passages of the Constitution just to cast a ballot and pass racist literacy tests. American laws barred Chinese workers from becoming citizens or marrying white people, and at one point kept Chinese women from immigrating to the U.S. at all. American Indian and Indigenous languages were banned from being spoken in the 1800s, but now federal grants fund their slow recovery.  Separate but equal was once the law of the land-and now every university and school in this nation is required to admit students regardless of race.\n\nI do not mean to suggest that these kinds of battles have ever been easy. There have been casualties and indescribable losses along the way. But there has always been a struggle to make things better for the most vulnerable people in this country, and there is power in that work. Anti-critical race theory laws will not erase those efforts.\n\nYes, the fight against critical race theory is a fight against affirmative action, a refusal to acknowledge the easily proven facts of American racism throughout this nation's history, and a defense of white supremacy and power. Yes, it aims to terrorize and frighten people in every space of learning in American society. And, yes, we should be concerned. But the people behind this legislation should be concerned, too. Their efforts will fail. More than 60 percent of Americans say they are in favor of children of learning about slavery and the ongoing effects of racism. And we will teach them despite these roadblocks-in fact, we will teach them because of these roadblocks. Efforts claiming to oppose critical race theory are not just on the wrong side of history; they are on the wrong side of what-and who-America is today.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Critical race theory in the classroom: Understanding the debate\n\nSome states are placing limitations on racial inequality education in schools.\n\nCritical race theory, an academic concept about systemic racism typically taught in higher education institutions, has become a target of Republican legislators in states across the country.\n\nAt least 16 states have laws or policies in place that limit lessons about race and inequality being taught in American K-12 schools.\n\nMany of the bills don't directly mention critical race theory in their text, and instead legislate against lessons that may make students feel \"shame,\" \"guilt\" based on race or discuss \"oppression\" and \"intersectionality.\" Critics say the vague language could impact lessons detailing racism and oppression in the U.S.\n\nStill, lawmakers pushing these bills forward have invoked the educational movement of critical race theory while advocating for this legislation.\n\nCritical race theory, according to founding critical race theorist Kimberlé Crenshaw, is a discipline that seeks to understand how racism has shaped U.S. laws and how those laws have continued to impact the lives of non-white people.\n\nCritics of the theory claim it shames and guilts children based on their race.\n\n\"We should not teach that one race is superior to another,\" said Texas Republican state House Rep. Steve Toth in an interview with ABC News. \"We should not teach that one race is inferior to another.\"\n\n\"The law has played a substantially significant role in establishing what race and racism actually are in American society,\" Crenshaw told ABC News, pointing to the effect laws have had on Black people specifically.\n\nShe continued, \"We can never forget that slavery was perfectly legal and constitutionally protected. ... Law has played a mixed role in our history. It has enslaved us. It has justified disenfranchising us. It has justified segregating us. It has justified marginalizing us, criminalizing us.\"\n\nCrenshaw, who is also a Columbia Law School professor, believes the concept of critical race theory is being misrepresented and used as a political tool.\n\nAcademic experts, including Crenshaw, say critical race theory is not what is being taught in K-12 education curriculums.\n\nCritical race theory is a study in academia based on the concepts of systemic and institutional racism. Systemic racism refers to how the government has discriminated against Black, Indigenous and other people of color through unjust policies concerning housing, employment, criminal justice, education and more.\n\nFrom the conception of slavery in America, to the Jim Crow laws that segregated Black people, to the disproportionate criminalization and brutality against Black Americans, Crenshaw said racism and white supremacy have persevered in the U.S. through law.\n\nEven if some discriminatory laws or policies are no longer in effect, she said, they can still impact families for generations.\n\n\"From who lives where to the disproportionate consequences of COVID,\" Crenshaw said, \"these are all current ways in which racial disparities are produced.\"\n\nThe study also analyzes benefits white people have in society, which is sometimes referred to as \"white privilege.\" This refers to the concept that white people continue to be protected from the effects of systemic race-based discrimination because of their skin color.\n\n\"In every aspect of our lives, we encounter race,\" Jane Bolgatz, the associate dean for academic affairs at Fordham University Graduate School of Education, told ABC News. \"If we aren't talking about race, we aren't noticing the ways in which society pushes white people forward. And so then we're not noticing the fact that these winds are not only pushing them forward but pushing people of color backward.\"\n\nSome educators across the U.S. expanded their curriculums on racial inequality in response to the turbulent year of protests against police brutality and disproportionate police violence against Black people.\n\nCrenshaw said she believes the latest legislation on education and the teachings about structural racism are not about the curriculum itself, but about the power that education about racism can have on fixing systems of oppression.\n\n\"Not talking about [racial disparities] is simply a way of just naturalizing them, normalizing them and allowing these patterns to continue over and over again,\" Crenshaw said. \"There has been a deep insecurity that politicians have weaponized from the beginning of our republic to convince those who are willing to listen that more racial justice means less for them.\"\n\nSome curriculums now include more racialized historical events, such as the Tulsa race riot and the Rodney King case and the subsequent Los Angeles riots, that highlight the plight of Black and brown Americans in the United States.\n\nBut those educators say their efforts are in danger due to these potential new restrictions on education.\n\nRepublican-majority state legislatures across the country have introduced or implemented restrictions on teaching about racial inequality in schools. These bills -- in Florida, Tennessee, Texas, Idaho, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Louisiana -- include almost the exact same language.\n\nMany of the bills say include language that would ban teachers from teaching that \"one race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex,\" that \"an individual, by virtue of the individual's race or sex, is inherently privileged, racist, sexist or oppressive, whether consciously or subconsciously,\" that \"a meritocracy is inherently racist or sexist, or designed by a particular race or sex to oppress members of another race or sex\" and that \"this state or the United States is fundamentally or irredeemably racist or sexist.\"\n\nCritical race theorists, analysts and educators say the discipline does not attack individual students for their privileges, but rather, it makes them aware of how different systems in the U.S. discriminate against others.\n\n\"If a kid is being taught that they're an oppressor, that means that the person who's doing the teaching is not explaining the difference between people and systems,\" Bolgatz said. \"Racism is a system. ... People are prejudiced, and we can work on our own individual prejudice, but we have to also work on the systems that discriminate writ large.\"\n\nStill, legislators are crusading against critical race theory -- as well as other programs that teach about oppression.\n\nIn his bid for the 2024 presidential election, former President Donald Trump promised to \"eliminate federal funding for any school that pushes critical race theory or left-wing gender ideology.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis has also led the charge in his state against critical race theory -- as well as diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\n\nThe Stop WOKE Act, which took effect in July 2022, restricts lessons and training on race and diversity in schools and in the workplace, particularly anything that discusses privilege or oppression based on race, or whether someone \"bears personal responsibility for and must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress\" due to U.S. racial history.\n\nThe law is temporarily blocked from impacting colleges and universities, and is still being battled out in the courts.\n\nThis legislation and other policy changes have lead to the rejection of an Advanced Placement African American studies course in the state, local reports of the removal and strict vetting of race-related books in school libraries, and an effort to remove funding toward race-related or diversity, equity and inclusion-related programs in colleges and states.\n\nRep. Toth, who introduced a similar bill in his own state, told ABC News that he encourages race to be taught in classrooms \"from a diverse and contending perspective without showing deference to one side or the other.\"\n\nHowever, he said he believes the term \"white privilege\" blames children for actions of racism in the past and says critical race theorists believe if someone can't acknowledge the impact of white supremacy or white privilege, then they are racist.\n\nHis bill does not specifically name critical race theory in the text of the language, but Toth has been a staunch critic of the theory's teachings and has cited the theory as problematic. He did not answer what his definition of critical race theory is.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt HB 1775 shared similar sentiments with Toth about his state's own bill, which he recently signed into law. In a statement sent to ABC News, Stitt said that some forms of the curriculum \"define and divide young Oklahomans\" based on their race or sex. The Oklahoma bill has almost identical language to the Texas bill.\n\n\"We can and should teach this history without labeling a young child as an oppressor or requiring he or she feel guilt or shame based on their race or sex,\" Stitt said. \"I refuse to tolerate otherwise during a time when we are already so polarized.\"\n\nJoy Hofmeister, Oklahoma's state superintendent of public instruction, has been outspoken about her concerns on the bill in her own state, especially concerning the history of the Tulsa race riot in her own state.\n\nHofmeister, along with the members of the Oklahoma City Public School Board of Education, have denounced the legislation.\n\n\"Students deserve an honest understanding of our history and its episodes of both greatness and shame if we hope to learn from our past,\" Hofmeister told ABC News in a statement. \"I am confident our educators will teach the Oklahoma Academic Standards, which finally and explicitly includes the hateful tragedy that was the 1921 [Tulsa] race massacre.\"\n\nBolgatz believes that U.S. history is racialized \"whether we are acknowledging or not\" and said children need to talk about and understand racism in the history of the U.S. to end the current systems of racism.\n\nThe American Psychological Association reports that infants and toddlers are often aware of race and can display racist beliefs from their young age. Although most adults believe talk about race and discrimination should be stalled until the age of 5, according to the study, psychologists recommend helping young children navigate these ideas earlier than expected.\n\nBolgatz wrote the book, \"Talking Race in the Classroom,\" which addresses education on racial inequality from a young age. Talking about race and teaching about the way it affects people differently can help children and teens navigate and understand these systems of oppression, she said.\n\nBolgatz said white children often don't experience racism or acknowledge race in their daily lives, whereas children of color are faced with the reality of their skin color every day. They said that when children are socialized without being exposed to historical understandings of race and discrimination, harmful ideas can be easily entrenched in their young minds.\n\n\"We think that the law is neutral, we think that in schools are neutral, but they're just not,\" Bolgatz said. \"Now we have evidence for why the criminal justice system isn't neutral and how the educational system isn't neutral and how the medical systems aren't neutral.\"\n\n\"Why should we teach children? It's so that the children who are going to grow up and be doctors and teachers and police officers and judges have some understanding about what it means to be equitable,\" Bolgatz said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Critical race theory thrust into spotlight by misinformation\n\nAt least 35 states have introduced anti-critical race theory legislation.\n\nCritical race theory is a buzzword that is at the center of a heated debate on what children learn in classrooms.\n\nThe only problem -- what does it mean?\n\nSome parents and Republican legislators say educators are \"indoctrinating\" students with certain lessons on race that make students feel \"discomfort\" or \"shame.\"\n\nThey say critical race theory seeks to blame white students for the actions of people in the past and teach that \"the United States is fundamentally racist or sexist,\" according to a 2020 executive order from former President Donald Trump .\n\nCritical race theorists, educators and some parents say that some opponents are actively distorting what the theory is in order to reverse progress made in diversity and racial equity. They say it's also a way to rile up voters in a collective fight against perceived reverse discrimination.\n\nThe theory isn't being taught in K-12 classrooms, they say, but rather in law schools and higher education courses.\n\nAs a result, attempts to teach race, diversity and systemic racism -- no matter the scope or context -- are being villainized in public schools, a reaction, experts say, against people of color speaking up for civil rights. They also say that vague language in recent legislative efforts -- including those that punish teachers or expressly forbid some subjects -- could infringe on educators' ability to teach students basic U.S. history.\n\nThis gulf, and urge to understand critical race theory have made it a hotly searched term on Google in 2021 .\n\nAnd so, the debate rages on: at least 35 states have introduced anti-critical race theory legislation so far.\n\nWhere the debate began\n\nControversy over critical race theory took shape in 2020, following months of calls for racial equality and anti-racism efforts.\n\nMany industries and institutions vowed to respond to the calls for a racial reckoning. For some, that meant implementing lessons on diversity and oppression to improve equity in the workplace and in schools.\n\nThat September, then-President Donald Trump responded by banning any diversity training for the federal workforce that included lessons on \"white privilege\" or \"critical race theory,\" according to an Office of Management and Budget memo .\n\nThe White House directed federal agencies to \"cease and desist\" funding for race and diversity training, according to the memo.\n\nAccording to the memo, OMB director Russell Vought said that certain racial bias training efforts are \"un-American\" and \"divisive\" and that Trump wanted to end it.\n\nLater that month, Trump issued an executive order to that effect, without mentioning critical race theory. In it, he argued that the \"pernicious and false belief that America is an irredeemably racist and sexist country\" was undercutting the notion of the Founding Fathers that all men are created equal.\n\nThe anti-critical race theory movement gained traction when Christopher Rufo, a conservative activist and reporter, began amplifying reports and allegations in 2020 against agencies and schools that held training on \"white privilege,\" \"antiracism\" and how white people perpetuate systems of oppression. He appeared on Fox News to discuss his findings shortly before Trump declared his attacks on the theory.\n\nHe told ABC News in a Jan. 28 interview that \"all children should be protected by civil rights laws and if teachers are using their power to scapegoat, stereotype, demean or abuse them, that should stop\" regarding critical race theory.\n\n\"Everyone supports teaching a full, accurate and honest account of American history. Critical race theory is not a historical discipline,\" he argues. \"We're not fighting about history, we're fighting to restrict abusive practices that violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\"\n\nFrom September 2020 onward, the vast majority of national news stories about critical race theory came from conservative news sources, with mainstream news sources and liberal news sources falling behind, according to recent research from UCLA and UC San Diego .\n\nThe research found there were more than seven stories from national conservative news sources about critical race theory for every one story from a national liberal media source. In conservative media sources, news of the theory was paired with phrases like \"Marxism,\" \"oppression matrix,\" \"state-sanctioned racism,\" \"oppressor and oppressed,\" and \"collective guilt.\"\n\nThe study also noted incendiary language used in school board arguments against critical race theory that called it \"child abuse\" and \"the cancer\" of school districts.\n\nIn March 2021, Rufo tweeted: \"We will eventually turn it toxic, as we put all of the various cultural insanities under that brand category. The goal is to have the public read something crazy in the newspaper and immediately think 'critical race theory.'\"\n\nAnd this effort to attack education on race and diversity has worked, researchers say, through the waves of legislation and debate.\n\n\"This was an event that was manufactured,\" said Gloria Ladson-Billings, a critical race theorist, former professor and former president of the American Educational Research Association. \"Any discussion of race, racism, diversity, equity, inclusion, whiteness, social-emotional learning, slavery, school segregation -- any of that is now called critical race theory.\"\n\nRe-shaping critical race theory\n\nCritical race theory, scholars say, is a discipline that seeks to understand how racism has shaped U.S. laws and how those laws have continued to impact the lives of non-white people.\n\nJustin Hansford, a law professor at Howard University, says that critical race theorists, as most philosophers, have many different analyses concerning racism in the U.S. and there isn't one way of teaching or looking at things.\n\n\"[This] campaign thrives on caricature - on often distorting altogether both scholarship and K-12 educators' efforts at accurate and inclusive education, deeming it (and particularly K-12 efforts to discuss the full scope of racism in our nation) wholly inappropriate for school,\" said UCLA and UC San Diego researchers in a study on the impact of anti-CRT campaigns.\n\nHansford says critical race theory has been made into a boogeyman for all lessons that aim to discuss current issues of racism and inequality in a time when institutions have begun to address racism.\n\n\"There's long-term resentment against people of color speaking up for civil rights,\" Hansford adds. \"If you don't see race, that doesn't really help anybody. It's ignoring the truth.\"\n\nLegislators and anti-CRT advocates like Rufo have said that most Americans oppose teaching critical race theory in schools.\n\nBut researchers from Monmouth University found in a November 2021 study that study that respondents seem to approve of education on race, but not when the question is phrased asking about \"critical race theory:\"\n\nWhen asked about teaching \"the history of racism\" in schools, 75% supported the idea. However, when asked about teaching critical race theory, only 43% supported it.\n\n\"Whoever controls the message controls how the public will react,\" said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute. \"As the huge differences in the poll questions on teaching race show, a negative visceral message can be very powerful in reframing an issue in the public's mind.\"\n\nLegislative efforts continue\n\nStill, there have been several bills across the nation that broadly target race education through arguments against critical race theory.\n\nThe majority of them look almost identical and many have no actual mention of critical race theory in their text, including bills signed into law in Texas , Oklahoma , and New Hampshire .\n\nThey list restrictions that say school employees can not teach lessons that include that:\n\nThis legislation coincides with an ongoing effort to ban from schools with diverse learning content on race, gender and sexuality that some parents say are explicit or obscene.\n\nSome educators fear that not only are their jobs on the line because of these policies but the education and future preparedness of their students are also at risk.\n\n\"You cannot hide this from students forever,\" Ladson-Billings said. \"I would have students come to the university level and when they would begin the search for history, they were angry, right? Why didn't my parents ever tell us this? Why weren't we ever taught this?\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "What critical race theory is - and isn't\n\nCritical race theory. You may be hearing those three words a lot these days.\n\nLawmakers in Tennessee and Idaho have banned its teaching from their public schools' curriculum, while parents in Texas are opposing a school district 's efforts to combat racism with lessons in \"cultural awareness\" - seen by some as critical race theory.\n\nIt's a concept that's been around for decades and that seeks to understand and address inequality and racism in the US. The term also has become politicized and been attacked by its critics as a Marxist ideology that's a threat to the American way of life.\n\nTo get a deeper understanding of what critical race theory is - and isn't - we talked to one of the scholars behind it.\n\nCritical race theory recognizes that systemic racism is part of American society and challenges the beliefs that allow it to flourish.\n\n\"Critical race theory is a practice. It's an approach to grappling with a history of White supremacy that rejects the belief that what's in the past is in the past, and that the laws and systems that grow from that past are detached from it,\" said Kimberlé Crenshaw, a founding critical race theorist and a law professor who teaches at UCLA and Columbia University.\n\nCritical race theorists believe that racism is an everyday experience for most people of color, and that a large part of society has no interest in doing away with it because it benefits White elites.\n\nMany also believe that American institutions are racist and that people are privileged or oppressed because of their race.\n\nWhile the theory was started as a way to examine how laws and systems promote inequality, it has since expanded.\n\n\"Critical race theory attends not only to law's transformative role which is often celebrated, but also to its role in establishing the very rights and privileges that legal reform was set to dismantle,\" Crenshaw told CNN.\n\n\"Like American history itself, a proper understanding of the ground upon which we stand requires a balanced assessment, not a simplistic commitment to jingoistic accounts of our nation's past and current dynamics.\"\n\nCrenshaw is one of its founding scholars and hosted a workshop on the critical race theory movement in 1989 . But the idea behind it goes back much further, to the work of civil rights activists such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Fannie Lou Hamer and Pauli Murray.\n\n\"Everything builds on what came before,\" Crenshaw said, adding that \"the so-called American dilemma was not simply a matter of prejudice but a matter of structured disadvantages that stretched across American society.\"\n\nCrenshaw said she and others \"took up the task of exploring the role that law played in establishing the very practices of exclusion and disadvantage.\"\n\nSome of the theory's earliest origins can be traced back to the 1970s, when lawyers, activists and legal scholars realized the advances of the civil rights era of the 1960s had stalled, according to the book, \"Critical Race Theory: An Introduction.\"\n\nCrenshaw was among a group of intellectuals, along with Derrick Bell, Alan Freeman and Richard Delgado, who attended a 1989 conference in Wisconsin that focused on new strategies to combat racism.\n\nIn 1993, Delgado, Crenshaw, Mari Matsuda and Charles R. Lawrence wrote the book, \"Words That Wound: Critical Race Theory, Assaultive Speech, and the First Amendment.\"\n\nSome critical race theorists also believe notions of race are products of social thought and relations, not biology.\n\n\"They correspond to no biological or genetic reality; rather, races are categories that society invents, manipulates, or retires when convenient,\"  Delgado and Jean Stefancic wrote in \"Critical Race Theory: An Introduction.\"\n\nThe theory has a passionate group of followers who are mostly academics. It has inspired at least a dozen books, more than 250 law review articles and several conferences.\n\n\"At this point, it is wider than any specific discipline or school of thought. It isn't even exclusively American,\" Crenshaw said.\n\nThe concept has taken on new urgency since the killings last year of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other African Americans by police officers led to a national reckoning on race.\n\nOver the past year many Americans have called for for an examination of systemic racism - in part through education such as the teaching of The New York Times' 1619 Project in schools. That Pulitzer Prize-winning project reframes American history around the date of August 1619, when the first slave ship arrived on America's shores.\n\nCornell and Harvard universities have conducted research on it. So have the National Institutes of Health . The theory has also led to similar groups focused on Asian American, Latino and Indian racial experiences.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had scheduled training on critical race theory last fall before the program was canceled by President Trump's White House.\n\nSo far, President Biden has been more receptive to critical race theory. His administration is promoting education programs - opposed by many conservatives - that address systemic racism in the US and the country's legacy of slavery.\n\nCritics have slammed the theory, with conservatives accusing it of poisoning discussions on racism.\n\nPresident Trump opposed the teaching of the 1619 Project in schools and banned federal agencies from conducting racial sensitivity training related to critical race theory. His administration called it \"divisive, anti-American propaganda.\"\n\n\"Students in our universities are inundated with critical race theory. This is a Marxist doctrine holding that America is a wicked and racist nation, that even young children are complicit in oppression, and that our entire society must be radically transformed,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Critical race theory is being forced into our children's schools, it's being imposed into workplace trainings, and it's being deployed to rip apart friends, neighbors and families.\"\n\nTennessee state Sen. Brian Kelsey, a Republican, argued last week on Twitter that critical race theory is harmful to students because it \"teaches that American democracy is a lie.

      "text": "Critical race theory is a lens. Here are 11 ways looking through it might refine your understanding of history\n\nCritical race theory is just that - a theory - but the term has been weaponized, with its most extreme critics alleging that merely studying the theory is racist.\n\nLong before the concept dubbed CRT drew controversy, scholars were studying how bigotry and bias infiltrated American institutions and shaped American life. After all, any telling of American history cannot fairly ignore that 177 of the country's 245 years - 72% of its existence, all but roughly three generations - played out under slavery or Jim Crow.\n\nAs Kimberlé Crenshaw , a preeminent CRT scholar, put it: The theory is an approach to \"grappling with a history of White supremacy that rejects the belief that what's in the past is in the past.\"\n\nYes, race relations are better than they were in 1776, or in 1976, but that's not the point. No one who overlooks the role racism has played in the laws and policies of the United States can have a true and full understanding of its history. It's just dishonest.\n\nRelated article What critical race theory is -- and isn't\n\n\"Critical race theory's a catchy phrase, but most people talking about it are clueless. To most of us who have been doing this work, it means talking critically about our racist history,\" said Texas A&M sociology professor Joe Feagin, whose contributions to the scholarship include co-authoring \"White Racism: The Basics\" and \"Living with Racism: The Black Middle-Class Experience.\"\n\nThe driving forces of history - be they racism, sexism, classism or the like - need to be discussed in classrooms, where scholars can rigorously suss out fact and fiction. In reconsidering the role of race and racism in American history, that's what students of critical race theory aim to do.\n\n\"Kids of color need honest information about society as much as White kids do, so they're prepared to deal with racism,\" Feagin said. \"We are founded on racial oppression. Where I start with this is concrete history. I don't even bring in concepts.\"\n\nCRT has been around for decades, largely without contention, but given the increasingly divisive nature of the term, let's put it aside and look instead at its underpinnings, the reasons many academics and a growing set of layfolk believe it's needed in today's educational landscape - not only on college campuses but for younger students, too.\n\nThese are established facts of American history, many of them included in \"Race, Whiteness, and Education\" by scholar Zeus Leonardo, who presented these and other wayposts in an effort to \"capture a reliable portrait of White supremacy.\"\n\nThe following list is by no means comprehensive, but it lifts key and oft-overlooked elements of America's story to the fore in an attempt to analyze how they've molded the present and might shape the future.\n\nBefore the United States was born, European settlers killed millions of indigenous people across the Americas, but the fighting didn't stop after 1776. The Last Massacre , as the Battle of Kelley Creek in Nevada was known, unfolded in 1911.\n\nDeemed \"savages\" who must be civilized, Native Americans were left out of the 14th Amendment, which grants birthright citizenship, until 1924 . This came after more than three centuries of seizing land from tribes , some of whom had been on the continent since Before Christ. The Indian Removal Act codified the relocation, regularly violent, of people from their homelands. While the Trail of Tears is the most famous of the forced migrations, state-sponsored violence against tribes was profound and persistent.\n\nThe so-called \"termination policy,\" another attempt to assimilate Native Americans, wasn't abandoned until 1970. Legislative and judicial disputes over sovereignty continue today.\n\nRecommended reading: California Gov. Peter Burnett's 1851 remarks on a \"war of extermination,\" the Indian Appropriations Act of 1871 and \"A Short History of Indian Law in the Supreme Court\"\n\nTo subjugate people to chattel slavery or indentured servitude, the ruling class regards itself as superior to the enslaved.\n\nThe Constitution, that great founding document, was the original basis for slavery in the United States, dictating slaves were three-fifths of a person , that escaped slaves must be returned to their owners and forbidding any prohibition on slavery until 1808 (all of which, while long invalidated, remain in the Constitution .)\n\nAdd to that a litany of federal court rulings upholding slavery. The Slave Trade Act of 1794 banned participation in the international trade in humans, but slavery was not abolished until the 13th Amendment was passed in 1865. The amendment carried a caveat - \"except as a punishment for a crime\" - that resonates today in a country where Black and Hispanic inmates make up more than half of the populations in US prisons , and where incarcerated people are often required to perform labor for little or no compensation.\n\nRecommended reading: \"Slavery in the United States: Persons or Property?\" , \"The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850: Symbolic Gesture or Rational Guarantee?\" and \"We Can't Be Free Until We Fully Abolish Slavery\"\n\nThere's little more supremacist than outlawing the \"mixing of races\" to maintain the \"purity\" of one race. Before the United States was founded, Maryland not only banned unions between White and Black people, the colony ordered servitude for any woman engaged in such activity, as well as children born of such unions.\n\nSeveral states enacted anti-miscegenation laws after 1776 and reenacted them after Reconstruction. There were at least three attempts to add a miscegenation ban to the US Constitution, the last introduced by Sen. Coleman Blease in 1928 .\n\nBy the time the Supreme Court's 1967 Loving v. Virginia ruling authorized interracial marriages, most states had nixed the laws. A few (mostly Southern) holdouts remained with no legal backing. South Carolina did not officially repeal the law from its constitution until 1998 . Alabama overturned its interracial marriage ban in 2000, and state lawmakers will meet next year to, possibly, remove racist language on that subject and others from its constitution .\n\nRecommended reading: Pace v. Alabama , a 1986 report on the \"long, cruel history\" of America's \"last taboo\" and scholar Allison Skinner's 2016 report on the \"hidden bias against interracial couples\"\n\nAfter fighting a war for their tenuous freedom, African American men became citizens with the 14th Amendment , but they were routinely turned away from polls, prompting Congress to enact the 15th Amendment , allowing them to vote.\n\nIt had limited effect as states employed literacy tests , \"good character\" vouchers, poll taxes and more odious tactics to keep Black men out of ballot boxes. While women were granted the right to vote with the 19th Amendment in 1920, many Black women didn't see that right realized until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 banned various forms of disenfranchisement.\n\nThe Supreme Court pulled teeth from the act in 2013. Congress has yet to decide whether to enact new federal safeguards for voters. After last year's presidential election saw the highest turnout in history , lawmakers in several states have aimed to restrict voting .\n\nRecommended reading: The fight to vote in one of Georgia's Blackest counties, \"What a Colored Man Should Do to Vote\" and Shelby County v. Holder\n\nVoting rights, citizenship and property ownership for African Americans came during post-war Reconstruction , which later saw Black Southerners ascend to political power - but it didn't last. Twelve years after the Civil War, Jim Crow - an evolution of slave codes and Black codes - took hold, ushering in a series of laws and societal norms that would prove ruinous to the newly freed Americans.\n\nAs clergy, journalists, politicians and scientists reinforced the abhorrent notions of White supremacy , Jim Crow laws provided the backbone of America's racial caste system, which the Supreme Court upheld in 1896. It would remain the law of the land for about seven more decades.\n\nStates enacted segregation laws , separating public services and spaces along racial lines or barring African Americans outright, while the Jim Crow era's etiquette rules governed everything from how Black people showed affection to each other to how they addressed White people. The price for defiance? Usually beatings or lynchings.\n\nRecommended reading: \"Plessy v. Ferguson: Who Was Plessy?\" , \"Jim Crow Guide: The Way It Was\" and \"Daily Life in the Jim Crow South, 1900-1945\"\n\nLaws prohibited the arbitrary or extrajudicial killing of Black people, but more important than what was codified during Jim Crow is what was not codified. When an anti-lynching bill was introduced in Congress in 1918, it took years to pass the House before hitting a Senate roadblock.\n\nSouthern lawmakers baselessly claimed Black men were lynched for raping White women - a phantasm that still haunts Black men - and asserted laws governing lynchings were best left to the states. Researchers have found evidence of thousands of lynchings - and they're sure they're undercounting.\n\nWhile many associate lynchings with hangings, historians say numerous mass killings fit the definition - from the political violence in New Orleans in 1866, Colfax, Louisiana , in 1873, and Wilmington, North Carolina , in 1898, to massacres in Atlanta (1906), Springfield, Illinois , (1908) East St. Louis, Illinois , (1917) Tulsa, Oklahoma , (1921) and Rosewood, Florida (1923), to name a few.\n\nCongress has never passed an anti-lynching law. A bill named for Emmett Till passed the House last year by a 410-4 vote, but was held up in the Senate by a lone lawmaker who called it overly broad.\n\nRecommended reading: United States v. Cruikshank , \"The Charleston Massacre and the Rape Myth of Reconstruction\" and CNN's report on America's long legacy of lynching\n\nWhite supremacy was clearly at the heart of early immigration laws. The 1790 Naturalization Act said only \"a free white person\" need apply. In the mid- to late 1800s, as German, Irish and Chinese immigrants began to arrive on American shores, Asian immigrants were singled out in the Page Act of 1875 and later the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 . Immigration officials were particularly hard on Asian women, who were maligned as disease-ridden and promiscuous and subjected to humiliating interrogations and physical exams .\n\nBeginning in 1929, California and other states deported about 2 million people of Mexican ancestry, more than half of whom had been born in the United States (about 400,000 in California alone were citizens or legal residents). In the 1950s, Operation Wetback (yes, the actual name) resulted in hundreds of thousands of deportations to Mexico, though the exact number is disputed .\n\nWhile immigration policies are fairer today, at least one successful presidential candidate resurrected specters of America's dark past, praising Operation Wetback , attacking Dreamers , using bigoted terms for Covid-19 and allegedly bashing immigrants from \"s**thole countries , including Haiti and some African nations.\n\nRecommended reading: \"History of Angel Island Immigration Station,\" a report on the lost history of Mexican \"repatriation\" and \"The Chinese Must Go!\"\n\nSlavery brought with it anti-literacy laws, which states continued to pass and enforce until the mid-1800s . The aversion to educating African Americans wasn't limited to the South. See the stories of a rejected proposal for a college in New Haven, Connecticut , a mob's destruction of the Noyes Academy in Canaan, New Hampshire, or the attack on a school for \"young ladies of color\" in Canterbury, Connecticut.\n\nPost-slavery, segregation ensured Black children were sent to their own schools, and while the Supreme Court's Plessy v. Ferguson decision demanded \"separate but equal\" facilities, there was nothing equal about the education Black kids received. The high court recognized as much in its landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling.\n\nStill, segregated school systems remain a reality . Rights groups have pointed out inequality throughout the US education system, including in school funding , \"tracking\" practices , redistricting , school discipline (and the \"school-to-prison pipeline\" ), high-stakes testing and how African American boys are perceived , among other phenomena. The uneven treatment can continue in college and after .\n\nRecommended reading: \"The Essence of Innocence: Consequences of Dehumanizing Black Children,\" the US Department of Education's 2014 report on \"troubling racial disparities\" in public schools and the personal narrative of a woman jailed in 1854 in Virginia for teaching Black children to read\n\nSlavery and Jim Crow funneled workers of color into low-wage vocations, such as farm work, housecleaning and driving wagons - and the percent of people of color working in similar occupations today remains skewed.\n\nBlack codes and their subsequent Jim Crow manifestations criminalized elements of African American behavior - whether promoting \"social equality\" in Mississippi or waiting in the wrong room for a train in Kentucky - reopening them to slavery via incarceration, a la the 13th Amendment.\n\nAnti-enticement measures tilted the jobs landscape by forbidding employers from offering Black workers higher wages than they were already receiving. Debt peonage - in which an employer compels someone to work to cover a debt - was outlawed in 1867, but through transportation and living expenses, merchant credits and sharecropping loans, scurrilous White employers could force minorities to work until the system was eradicated in the 1940s .\n\nThe Fair Labor Standards Act and Wagner Act improved working conditions and collective bargaining, respectively, but they also excluded many jobs filled by people of color.\n\nData on 2019 household income showed that while wages have risen since 2000, Asian and White households fare the best , with the median White household bringing in $20,000 a year more than a median Hispanic household and $30,000 more than a Black one. Meanwhile, since 1980, funding and staffing for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has been on the decline.\n\nRecommended reading: \"The Impact of Structural Racism in Employment and Wages on Minority Women's Health,\" economist William Spriggs' 2019 testimony to a House committee and a report on how Black workers face two lethal pre-existing conditions for Covid-19: racism and economic inequality\n\nFollowing the broken promise of \"40 Acres and a Mule,\" Jim Crow stoked the Great Migration of millions of Southern Black people to the North and West - which, in turn, spurred exclusionary zoning. In 1910, Baltimore became the first city to ban African Americans from living in White neighborhoods. The practice spread west to Oklahoma City and north to Colwyn, Pennsylvania , by 1916.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court ruled such discrimination unconstitutional in 1917's Buchanan v. Warley decision , cities devoted significant real estate solely to detached single-family housing - which, without mentioning race, shut out most minorities . Racial covenants in property deeds also precluded non-White buyers.\n\nThe Federal Housing Administration, created in 1934 to boost home ownership, exacerbated matters. Worried that African American homeowners would bring down White property values , the FHA refused to insure Black homes in White neighborhoods, resulting in redlining - whereby African Americans were steered to \"hazardous\" inner cities and Whites to \"desirable\" suburbia. Government underwriters and 1944's GI Bill continued the pattern of prejudice, while the American Housing Act of 1949 and Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 displaced tens of thousands of minorities. Discriminatory lending and racial covenants weren't outlawed until 1968 .\n\nAfter the subprime lending crisis hit in 2007, about 2.5 million Americans lost their homes by 2009, with Black and Latino homeowners' foreclosure rates among recent borrowers more than doubling that of their White counterparts. The return of Whites to cities in the last decade further displaced minorities . In 2019, Black home ownership hit its lowest rate since 1970 , and a recent study shows Hispanics and African Americans must earn more than Whites to live in affluent neighborhoods.\n\nRecommended reading: Report on cities questioning single-family zoning , the Village of Euclid, Ohio v. Ambler Realty Co. and \"The controversial history of Levittown, America's first suburb\"\n\nIn the country's early years, the medical profession believed it was OK to experiment on minorities - often without consent - and deliver subpar, if any, medical treatment , but the behavior continued long after that.\n\nThe father of gynecology experimented on enslaved women without anesthesia in the mid-1800s; loose laws in the early 1900s allowed forced sterilization of countless minorities and others, into the 1970s ; the US government-led Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment , which let 399 Black men go untreated for the disease, ran from 1932 to 1972; Ebb Cade, a Black man, was unknowingly the first subject in the Manhattan Project's human radiation experiments ; and Henrietta Lacks' cells have led to groundbreaking medical breakthroughs , but the 31-year-old Black woman died of cancer in 1951 with no knowledge her tissue had been taken without her consent .\n\nBlack Americans' trust in the medical profession remains battered. Recent studies show bias, while better, remains problematic - with pain management and health care algorithms offering just two examples. African Americans are also disproportionately enrolled in studies that don't require informed consent and are hit much harder when it comes to a range of medical issues, from maternal mortality to Covid-19 .\n\nA dearth of Black doctors , of course, does nothing to rectify the issues.\n\nRecommended reading: \"Health Inequality Actually Is a 'Black and White Issue,' Research Says,\" the debate over former Surgeon General Thomas Parran's legacy and \"A medical hell recounted by its victims\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Critical race theory has become a social and political lightning rod. This is how we got here\n\nFrom chaotic school board meetings to political strife along party lines, critical race theory has ignited a controversy across the country in recent months.\n\nAt least two dozen states have banned critical race theory or introduced legislation to ban it from being taught in the classroom, with many conservatives calling it a divisive concept. Educators, however, argue that critical race theory itself is generally not included in grade school curriculum.\n\nAnd proponents along with critical race theorists insist that the concept is largely misunderstood.\n\nRelated article What critical race theory is -- and isn't\n\nGary Peller, a professor at Georgetown Law and author of \"Critical Race Consciousness: Reconsidering American Ideologies of Racial Justice,\" said critical race theory acknowledges that racism is both systemic and institutional in American society and that White people have historically held racial power. Its origins date back to the late 1970s and early 1980s when legal scholars realized that advances in the civil rights movement did not eradicate racism, Peller said.\n\n\"Critical race theory starts from the realization... that simply taking down Whites only signs was not sufficient to end the effects of centuries of the subordination of African Americans in the United States,\" Peller said. \"And that there were other vestiges of racial power that remained.\"\n\nHere is a look at how critical race theory became a central issue this year and the uproar surrounding it.\n\nPeller and other political observers credit Christopher Rufo, a senior conservative research fellow and filmmaker, with injecting critical race theory back into American consciousness in 2020.\n\nRufo had done some research on diversity trainings for federal employees and said he believed critical race theory had \"pervaded\" every level of government.\n\nIn a Fox News interview in September 2020, Rufo said he called on then-President Donald Trump \"to immediately issue an executive order and stamp out this destructive, divisive, pseudoscientific ideology at its root.\"\n\nTrump would later denounce critical race theory himself and order a ban on teaching critical race theory in federal government trainings.\n\nThe move was widely criticized by federal employee groups who said Trump was promoting a misconception of diversity training meant to make workplaces more welcoming for employees of all races.\n\n\"Critical race theory is being forced into our children's schools, it's being imposed into workplace trainings, and its being deployed to rip apart friends, neighbors, and families,\" Trump said in September.\n\nRelated article The engineered conservative panic over critical race theory, explained\n\nBut Peller said critical race theory is too complex for grade school students to understand and that it's being conflated with conversations about diversity and equality. The concept is usually taught in law school or graduate school, he said.\n\nSome of Rufo's critics have accused him of purposely distorting the true nature of critical race theory.\n\n\"They are calling anything really having to do with race at all critical race theory,\" Peller said. \"And that's just incorrect.\"\n\nKimberlé Crenshaw, a founding critical race theorist and a law professor who teaches at UCLA and Columbia University, said the controversy is not about critical race theory but about America's racial anxiety.\n\n\"This is a classic situation where people have an itch to scratch,\" Crenshaw said. \"The itch is this concern about people of color demanding too much. The concern is about the consequences of the reckoning that happened last year to George Floyd . So this reaction is a backlash to the growing conversation about racial inequality.\"\n\nIn March, Rufo tweeted that he and other critical race theory opponents were \"steadily driving up negative perceptions\" of the concept.\n\n\"We will eventually turn it toxic, as we pull all of the various cultural insanities under that brand category,\" the tweet read.\n\nSince Rufo's comments in March, the critical race theory debate has exploded in school districts, leading to protests, riotous school board meetings, school board recall efforts, and educators being pushed out of their jobs.\n\nIn June, Loudoun County Public Schools in Virginia came under fire after chaos erupted during public comment at a school board meeting over claims that critical race theory was being taught in the classroom.\n\nParents and community members accused the school district of requiring teachers to take a diversity training that discusses the concept and then teaching it to students.\n\nSchool officials, however, said critical race theory was not part of their curriculum and that \"misconceptions and misinformation\" were distorting the equity work being done in the school district.\n\nCollege professor Julia Holcomb was at the school board meeting and said she was disturbed by the anti-critical race theory crowd. She is convinced it's no mistake it got out of hand.\n\n\"We're arguing about this because there are political forces that want us to be arguing about it,\" Holcomb told CNN.\n\nRelated article Critical race theory is a lens. Here are 11 ways looking through it might refine your understanding of history\n\nLoudon is now among several school boards across the country facing recalls from parent and political groups over critical race theory. Other school board recall efforts have been reported in the Mequon-Thiensville School District in Wisconsin and the Litchfield Elementary School District in Arizona.\n\nThe backlash from parents has also forced some educators to resign from their jobs, including a Black superintendent in Connecticut who was accused of pushing critical race theory on students after he helped lead efforts to change the racial climate in the district.\n\nAnd it's not just White conservatives blasting critical race theory.\n\nHarry Jackson was so determined to keep critical race theory out of his children's Virginia school district that he campaigned and became the first Black president-elect of the district's Parent Teacher Association.\n\n\"Advocates for critical race theory are even arguing that merit is racist, they argue that math is even racist,\" Jackson said. \"I am worried about the dumbing down of curriculum. I am worried about this forced equality. I don't think it works in other areas of the world. It certainly won't work in the United States.\"\n\nThe panic over critical race theory teachings has inspired some conservative groups to launch information campaigns and host seminars about the concept.\n\nThe Texas Public Policy Foundation , a non-partisan research institute dedicated to liberty, free enterprise, and personal responsibility, shared a flyer on Twitter in June that listed \"buzzworthy\" language for parents to look out for to determine whether critical race theory is being taught at their child's school. Some of the terms included equity, social justice, White privilege, Black lives matter and anti-racism. The foundation later deleted the tweet.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation released a video titled \"The Truth About Critical Race Theory\" that called it \"blatantly and unapologetically racist.\"\n\nIn Minnesota, Catrin Wigfall, a policy fellow for the Center of the American Experiment , is part of a statewide tour offering anti-critical race theory trainings.\n\nDuring one training, the audience took photographs of slides and diligent notes during Wigfall's presentation. Attendees also received a brochure with talking points to defend their opposition to critical race theory.\n\nActivist and educator Raj Sethuraju attended the meeting and thought the seminar itself was racist.\n\n\"Critical race theory fundamentally asks the question where do our laws come from and how it is informed by our racialized practices,\" Sethuraju said. \"Racist practices. Why are we not questioning that?\"\n\nBut most attendees, including grandparents and retired teachers, felt the seminar was spot on.\n\n\"There are racists in the country who do the wrong things but our country is not racist,\" said Pat Levander, a retired lawyer. \"That's the difference.\"\n\nMarge Lindberg, a retired teacher, agreed.\n\n\"You look under the surface and it really breeds hate more than unity and at a time when our country needs to work on unity,\" she said.\n\nCNN's Kimberly Berryman contributed.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Q&A: What is 'critical race theory,' really? A new book tries to explain\n\nBREAKING: Man arrested in theft of DHS chief Kristi Noem's purse is in the U.S. illegally, official says\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nBy Benjy Sarlin\n\nDiscussing critical race theory is hard. There's critical race theory, an academic movement dating back to the 1970s that pioneered ideas like \"structural racism\" and \"intersectionality.\" And then there's \"critical race theory,\" which has become a popular catch-all term on the right for discussions around race that activists consider offensive. And the distinction between the two is often lost in the national shouting match that's played out everywhere from from the White House to local school boards.\n\nSociologist Victor Ray was on his way to teaching his intro class on critical race theory when he saw the news that then-President Trump was banning CRT from federal workforce training. With the public conversation around it growing increasingly distorted, he decided to provide people hearing about it for the first time with a primer. His new book, On Critical Race Theory: Why It Matters & Why You Should Care lays out the origins of the movement, its most prominent concepts and thinkers, and how he and other academics use its ideas to research and explain racial discrimination.\n\nWe talked to Ray, the F. Wendell Miller Associate Professor at the University of Iowa, about his book. Our conversation is below, edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ: What's your best short definition of critical race theory for someone learning about it for the first time?\n\nRay : It's the official body of legal scholarship that tried to explain the political backlash and legal backlash to the civil rights movement. You had all of these major civil rights victories in the late 1960s and even the 1950s that by the Reagan era were being undermined. And so a group of legal scholars, like Derrick Bell, Kimberlé Crenshaw, and other folks, got together to try and explain why the law was inadequate, or why maybe the legal victories of the 60s weren't a permanent victory. They drew on history and social sciences to critique the way both liberals and conservatives approached it.\n\nCritical race theory also became kind of a broad approach and framework for thinking about race. It criticized things like individual notions of prejudice and discrimination versus structural racism, and replaced biological notions of race with the idea that race is a social construction, and social factors are more important than individual ones.\n\nQ: You mention \"structural racism\" in contrast to individual prejudice. What does structural racism mean?\n\nRay: A more mainstream \"racism\" is individuals not liking someone because of their racial background. It's a cop choosing to choke someone to death with their knee for nine minutes. The idea here is that it is based on some sort of individual disposition of the cop.\n\nBut what structural racism says is, look, individual prejudice is important and we don't necessarily want to discount that, but let's think about what empowered the cop to get his knee on George Floyd's neck in the first place. And if we do that, it's a whole history of laws that allow cops to racially profile in some cases, to stop and frisk. It's a history of cops coming out of union busting and slave patrols in the U.S. South. It's a history of laws that provide police officers with impunity.\n\nThere are individuals within that system that have all different kinds or varying levels of personal animosity, or no personal animosity. If we think about \"stop and frisk,\" I genuinely believe that there are a lot of people of color, police officers, who join the force, who say \"I'm going to make it better,\" and they genuinely try to make it better.\n\nBut if they follow the rules of that system, they're going to disproportionately stop and frisk Black and Latino men . We have the data on that. Being part of a system means that, not always, but sometimes, you might contribute to that system or be complicit in its reproduction.\n\nQ: You write that \"Critical race theorists reject the mythology of racial progress.\" What is that mythology and why is it harmful?\n\nRay: The mythology is that things are always getting better around race. We had slavery, we fought the Civil War, that fixed that. Then Jim Crow happened, civil rights movement fixed the problems of Jim Crow. President Obama got elected, we're post-racial.\n\nFollowing each of those massive important movements for freedom and justice, they were met with intense white backlash. And in some cases, the backlash created new creative means of disenfranchising black folks in particular, and people of color more broadly.\n\nLook at what's happening now around the country with massive voter disenfranchisement. The number of laws passed since 2020, folks taking over local elections, and really trying to disenfranchise people through those mechanisms.\n\nSo critical race theory focuses not just on the bright side, of American racial history, but it points out that there have always been people opposed to racial progress. And oftentimes, those folks are very, very effective.\n\nQ: One related idea you devote a chapter to is the late professor Derrick Bell's theory of \"interest convergence,\" or the idea that progress towards equality happens primarily when it suits white people's material interests, rather than because of some broad moral awakening.\n\nRay: Derrick Bell argues that when we look at the Civil War, or we look at the Civil Rights Movement and Brown v. Board of Education , that those definitely disadvantaged some white Americans, but on the whole, they tended to benefit at least enough non-white folks and white elites that their interests temporarily converged.\n\nBell talks about Brown v. Board of Education as sort of the most important example of this. It's often hailed as the apotheosis of American racial progress.\n\nBut Bell says, look, the morality of this didn't change, folks always knew that segregation was immoral. What actually changed was America's geopolitical position. The Soviet Union was effectively using America's racism in anti-American propaganda in order to get proxy states on their side. And the State Department recognized this, and a number of politicians recognized this, and came out in support of the winning side in Brown .\n\nQ: If the thesis is that a critical mass of white voters inevitably tend to push back against necessary change, is real change possible?\n\nRay: I guess it depends on what you mean by real change. I would never say that the Civil War or the end of Jim Crow didn't make real substantive change. But I think there's also real substantive backlash, there are counter-movements to that change that are also very important.\n\nIbram X. Kendi is very clear that he's not a critical race theorist, but he has this line that I think about quite a bit: Racial progress has happened in U.S. history, and racist progress has happened.\n\nI think a lot of folks when they talk about racial inequality, they want a kind of final policy that's going to end it. Critical race theory is saying, look, folks will continue to fight, and realistically, you're going to have to continue to fight too if you're on the side of racial justice. That might not be hopeful, but I think it's purposeful.\n\nBenjy Sarlin is policy editor for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Mike Hixenbaugh on how a Dallas suburb led a national panic over race and schools\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nFrom his home in Texas at the time, NBC News reporter Mike Hixenbaugh spent years covering a fight over school boards. Southlake, a prosperous and conservative Dallas suburb, confronted high-profile incidents of bullying and racism at its schools with a diversity plan, modeled after what had seemed to work elsewhere. The reaction: A conservative backlash that roped in the state Republican Party, Fox News, and well-funded conservative campaign groups that won control of the school board and rolled everything back. The community became a national face of the post-2020 culture war over âcritical race theoryâ and Hixenbaugh wrote about all of it in âThey Came for the Schools,â which was released this week. This is an edited transcript of our conversation about the book.\n\nAmericana: One premise of this fight over schools in Southlake seems to be that the communityâs harmony was under attack. Was there ever some perfect moment when there was no division in Southlake, and it got ruined by liberals?\n\nMike Hixenbaugh: No, and one of the things I really wanted to do was to put whatâs been happening since 2020 into a longer historical context. Southlake is a proxy for the development of suburbs writ large, and how they were designed for white folks beginning in the 1940s and 50s, during the era of white flight and desegregation. Over the last 20 or 30 years, many of the suburbs have grown more diverse. If youâre a Black kid going to school in Southlake in the 1990s, in the 2000s, it wasnât uncommon to have classmates make really stupid, racist comments.\n\nDid they see themselves as racists? Probably not. âYouâre the smartest Black girl I knowâ â things like that, what you might now call microaggressions. But after Trump got in office in 2017, there was this wave of one-off stories that you could find in pretty much any metro area in the country. There are suburban school districts where kids have been chanting âbuild the wallâ at their Hispanic classmates, or carving the N-word on a bathroom stall along with Make America Great Again, or recording themselves saying the N-word.\n\nAmericana: And how did schools respond?\n\nHixenbaugh: In suburbs, all over the place, schools were reckoning with this kind of culture that kind of had been there, but was now far more apparent. Southlake and other districts formed committees to address this stuff. In the aftermath of George Floydâs murder, and the widespread protests and the backlash that followed, suddenly conservatives were looking at schools, they were looking at the pandemic restrictions, and they asked: What are all these plans about diversity and inclusion?\n\nAmericana: Were the schools in decline when that panic began? In a lot of places, the backlash was powered by falling test scores, or worries about kids falling behind.\n\nHixenbaugh: No. In Southlake, there was a local panic and outrage over the mask policy. Schools were closed for the spring, like every school in the country in the spring during COVID. But the schools were not in decline. And if you look at the test scores, this is a community that is wealthy by design; they donât allow apartments or multifamily housing. The families of color that moved in were fairly affluent. Thereâs not really an achievement gap at Carroll and Southlake.\n\nBut some parents got really animated about the mask mandate, and saw what was happening with the protests for racial justice. There was an infamous Black Lives Matter group that led protests in Southlake Town Square â parents connected that with this diversity plan that the school was trying to implement. It ended up reaching a much bigger audience. Texas Scorecard, this news outlet for Republicans funded by some powerful Texas billionaires, got involved and helped to make Southlake the poster child for fighting BLM.\n\nAmericana: What was actually in the plan that inspired all of this?\n\nHixenbaugh: The cultural competence action plan called for mandatory diversity and inclusion training for teachers and students. It called for a review of the curriculum to make sure that students were getting a full reckoning of racism in Americaâs past. They wanted to increase the diversity of teacher applicants in the school district, and they wanted to hire a director of DEI with a six-figure salary. That wasnât what the BLM activists wanted, but the right basically conflated those things and said the districtâs trying to bow to these Black Lives Matter activists, these woke kids and young adults.\n\n[Conservative commentator] Dana Loesch, who lives in Southlake and is a major figure here, at least addressed the fact that some kids get bullied. Her take is that this is part of life. Itâs natural. Itâs how we set the pecking order, which, if you ask educators, is not a great response to bullying of any kind. But the parents organizing against this started saying: These harassment stories are fake. Itâs not real. Itâs not true. My kids have never been bullied. Iâve never seen this.\n\nAmericana: What exactly are people worried about happening to the schools and their children if they donât take over the school board?\n\nHixenbaugh: Iâll quote Allen West, the former Texas GOP chairman, who was very involved in this. After the CCAP was introduced, he held an event where he warned people: Texas is under assault from people who are moving here from places like New Jersey and California, and want to remake Texas and remake your community. He also said that the school board is the most important elected office in America because theyâre coming for your kids. He said it was just like Hitler: He was trying to remake society by indoctrinating children.\n\nSo, thatâs the fear. If we donât step forward and take control of the schools at the local, state and federal levels, the left is going to push LGBTQ identities on them, theyâre going to convince your kids to change genders, theyâre going to teach white kids that America is terrible, and that they should hate themselves. Theyâre going to teach Black kids that theyâre all victims, and that their skin color is the most important thing about them. Now, there are some cringy DEI programs and cringy lessons that have made it into them, but this Hitler strawman is just not substantiated by reality.\n\nAmericana: What are the federal stakes here? The Biden administration has intervened in some of these districts, on some of these issues; what could a second Trump administration change?\n\nHixenbaugh: Every public school in the country gets some percentage of their funding from the federal government. Itâs only, like, 2% of the budget in Southlake, but the federal government provides it and has held that funding over districtsâ heads via the enforcement of civil rights laws that were passed in the 1960s and 70s. That means guarantees for students of all races and ethnicities, Title IX protections for sex and gender. And thereâs been a handful of these cases, like Southlake, where there have been reports of discrimination and bullying and reports that the district failed to adequately address, where conservatives have taken over and basically banned any kind of DEI programs or explicit protections for LGBTQ students.\n\nThe federal government has opened investigations into several of these. What the Department of Education has typically done in these cases is go and negotiate with the schools and say, hereâs some changes to the student code of conduct or discrimination policy statement to make it acceptable. Thereâs a whole menu; itâs basically all the stuff that was in the CCAP that local voters rejected. So, whatâs at stake in the presidential election is whether the federal governmentâs still going to be in that business. Donald Trump has said heâd abolish the Education Department and return education policy to the states. Project 2025 has a whole long section on banning critical race theory, making sure that thereâs no special protections based on gender or sexual orientation in action, and ending administrative enforcement of civil rights laws by the Education Department. So this thing thatâs happening in Southlake right now? âDonât worry about it, you donât have to do the things that the Biden administration told you to do.â Thatâs whatâs on the line with education.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

Read it now .\n\nUS President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday aimed at closing the education department as part of a broader push to shrink the federal government.\n\nThe shutdown cannot be completed without congressional approval, setting the stage for a political and legal battle over the agencyâs role.\n\nThe Department of Education is responsible for offering federal grants and loans to college students , as well as providing funds to low-income schools and disabled students, but has no role in determining curricula or operating schools, which is primarily left to states and local districts.\n\nThe executive order directs Education Secretary Linda McMahon to shutter the department aside from some critical requirements required by law, as well as continue to provide â the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.â\n\nGetting congressional approval and overcoming legal battles to shutter the education department will be challenging, but Trumpâs rhetoric, along with massive layoffs at the agency, has already â radically transformed â the agency, Chalkbeat wrote. Education advocates fear that even if the departmentâs main functions remain intact, Trumpâs efforts to minimize its role will endanger critical expertise and studentsâ civil rights, and risk the loss of billions in federal funding to state and local education budgets. Despite the administrationâs vow to preserve funding for rural and low-income schools, staff reductions at the department have left the fate of those grants unclear. Thereâs a risk that rural schools â will have to do even more with even less ,â an education expert told NPR.\n\nTrumpâs plan to shut down the education department is rooted in a longstanding conservative movement against publicly funded education, Chris Lehmann of progressive magazine The Nation noted. The administration eventually hopes to replace public education with a privatized model of schooling by invoking â moral panics â over diversity initiatives and critical race theory, Lehmann argued. The conservative New York Postâs editorial board argued, however, that the DOE has been more of a â gift to teachers unions and the left ,â lamenting that it has failed to benefit students or lead to greater academic achievement. According to libertarian think tank Cato Institute, the DOEâs incompetence and high costs are an â albatross around [the] neck] of American education .â\n\nSign up for Semafor flagship\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

      "text": "What happened to âwokeâ? How the rightâs rallying cry faded away\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nAs his presidential campaign sputtered, Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., could sound like a candidate unstuck in time.\n\nIn June, he spent days responding to a dismissive comment from Barack Obama questioning his commitment to racial justice, saying America was a âland of opportunity, not a land of oppression.â In September, he rolled out an âempower parentsâ plan by explaining that children âneed the ABCs, not CRT.â Wherever he campaigned, he invoked his race and biography as the ultimate rebuke to race-obsessed progressives fixated on a âculture of grievanceâ instead of personal achievement: âMy life disproves their lie.â\n\nRepublican primary voters, who liked Scott personally, were unmoved. The conservative backlash to progressive ideas about race and gender â a war on âwokenessâ that powered the rise of Gov. Ron DeSantis and boycotts of some major brands â has faded as an issue in an increasingly uncompetitive primary.\n\nIn three primetime GOP debates, the word âwokeâ was mentioned just twice; once as an aside from Nikki Haley, once when Vivek Ramaswamy plugged his book, âWoke, Inc.â DeSantis, whose early speeches focused on his fight against wokeness â âWe will fight the woke in our legislature, we will fight the woke in education, we will fight the woke in our businessesâ â now mentions it sparingly.\n\nAnd in last weekâs elections, the conservative movement to win control of school boards had more disappointments than victories. Moms for Liberty-backed candidates picked up just 50 seats around the country. In some of their highest-profile races â an Iowa school board whose transgender inclusion policies were opposed by GOP presidential candidates, and another school board in the suburban Virginia county where a 2021 sexual assault powered a political backlash that year â progressives held on to their seats.\n\nâI think that there are other issues that have taken the forefront,â said Tiffany Justice, the co-founder of Moms for Liberty, which hosted Trump, DeSantis and Haley at its summer conference in Philadelphia. âWeâre one incident away from them being at the forefront again.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe decline of âwokenessâ as a catch-all Republican message that spoke to intense fears of progressive ideas taking over institutions had been happening for a while . It faded for three reasons â Trumpâs return to the national spotlight, the middling electoral impact of anti-wokeness messaging, and the legislative victories that local Republicans achieved before the presidential race got underway.\n\nIn Trumpâs case, there were strategic reasons to push âwokeâ out of the conservative conversation early. The less seriously Republican voters took the concept as a threat, the less tempted they might be to consider a candidate like DeSantis running to protect them from it. At the end of May, DeSantis entered the race, and within two weeks Trump was using a speech in suburban Des Moines to demean his rivalâs defining issue.\n\nâI donât like the term woke, because I hear woke, woke, woke,â Trump told conservatives in Urbandale. âItâs like, just a term they use. Half the people canât even define it.â\n\nDeSantis saw that for what it was â Trump attacking an opponentâs perceived strength. The Florida governor had defeated what he called âa woke corporation in Burbank, Californiaâ (Disney), which no other candidate could say. Haley, then polling in single digits, was trying to get to his right on âparental rightsâ legislation, saying that Floridaâs âDonât Say Gayâ bill didnât âgo far enough.â But Trump said that the messaging was weird and irrelevant, and plenty of primary voters took their cues from him.\n\nIn many states, Republicans convinced their voters they had already turned back the tide of creeping wokeness with their support. That was a factor in Iowa, where an education bill mirroring Floridaâs passed this summer. In the governments they controlled, Republicans had passed laws against public schools teaching âdivisiveâ ideas about race and gender identity. By the time Scott was campaigning against âcritical race theoryâ in Iowa, it had been banned in public schools for two years.\n\nProgressives werenât talking as much about it, either. After a June boycott of Bud Light, which had done a single promotion with a transgender influencer, and a June boycott of Target, which had displayed LGBTQ pride clothing near the front of its stores, those companies retreated . In June, the conservative Supreme Court majority ended affirmative action, which also bolstered an effort to end diversity, equity and inclusion policies at businesses. The next month, The Wall Street Journal reported companies had laid off thousands of DEI officers since 2020 as their work became more politically divisive and corporate budgets tightened.\n\nâMy sense is that âwokeâ is receding,â said Sohrab Ahmari, the author of âTyranny, Inc.,â whose 2019 criticism of drag queen story hours presaged years of conservative activism. âAnti-woke only really works in a dialectic where woke is a powerful force.â\n\nPolitically, the âwokeâ conversation produced some anxiety among centrist Democrats, especially after Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkinâs 2021 win, but has had few actual consequences at the ballot box. Democrats overperformed in the midterms and a well-financed attempt to weaponize policy debates around transgender minors and athletes flopped in key states like Michigan.\n\nThen came the off-year elections, where candidates backed by teachersâ unions won most of the races they were competing in. In the most contentious races, candidates squaring up against anti-woke conservatives portrayed themselves as the defenders of good school standards, and their opponents as book-banning ideologues.\n\nIn suburban Philadelphia, where a conservative school board had passed a series of anti-woke policies â restrictions on sexually explicit material in libraries, and rules requiring parents to be notified if their child identifies as transgender â Democrats won in a rout. In Virginiaâs Loudoun County, progressives won a majority while defending the systemâs diversity standards. Conservatives, they said, had misread the electorate.\n\nâI understand their fear, but a lot of it is not realizing what the real challenges in the schools are,â said Anne P. Donohue, a Democrat who won a seat on Loudoun Countyâs school board, in an interview before the election. âWeâre facing learning loss. Weâre facing absenteeism. Weâre facing emotional immaturity from kids whose education was stunted. These are big problems that weâre facing, and everybodyâs screaming about bathrooms?â\n\nMoms for Libertyâs Justice said that this was a misreading â teachersâ unions had far more to spend, they argued, an advantage that couldnât be overcome in a couple of years. âThey love the off-year cycle, because they can get their people out to vote,â Justice said. âMore people are waking up every day. And youâre going to see us win more races in the future and take more power away from the teachersâ unions. Theyâre scared out of their minds.â\n\nAfter last Wednesdayâs debate in Miami, DeSantis spokesman Andrew Romeo pushed back on the idea that the âwokeâ issue has vanished from the campaign.\n\nâThe questions havenât been focused on that,â Romeo said. âYouâve gotta go with the subject matter that they give you, and I think that the governor has done a good job of driving his message, of how to reverse a country thatâs in decline on a number of different fronts.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Ibram X. Kendiâs antiracism center is laying off staff\n\nSign up for Semafor Flagship: The daily global news briefing you can trust. Read it now .\n\nAs many as 15 to 20 staff members are being laid off at the Center for Antiracist Research at Boston University, which is led by prominent activist and scholar Ibram X. Kendi, according to a person familiar with the situation.\n\nThe person said the money that has been used to employ the staff members will be redirected to provide funding to visiting scholars who are already employed. The layoffs take effect later this year.\n\nIn a statement, BU spokesman Colin Riley confirmed the layoffs. He said the center is âevolving to a fellowship modelâ and would offer details on âthis new directionâ soon.\n\nKendi will remain the research centerâs director. Riley said BU and the center are âcommitted to working with and supporting affected employees as they look for their next opportunities.â\n\nBU and Kendi founded the center in 2020 amid widespread protests over police brutality and a national reckoning over issues of race. The center grew to include multiple offices that spanned policy and data research, and an archived version of the centerâs website from July listed 45 employees.\n\nThose staff pages were no longer active Thursday.\n\nBU announced that Kendi was joining the faculty and launching the center in June 2020, just as protests began sweeping the nation following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\n\nThe BU center was pitched as a novel and progressive way for the university to contribute to ongoing conversations around race in America. It has researched antiracist policies, tracked data related to racial disparities in America, and analyzed racial justice advocacy efforts. Its website describes the center as a place where âacademic research meets antiracist action .â\n\nThe center also collaborated with The Boston Globeâs opinion section to launch The Emancipator, a digital racial justice-focused publication, in 2021. The site has published independently of the Globe since the spring. It will continue to publish and was not affected by the layoffs, Riley said.\n\nKendi has been known for years as a leading scholar in the field of antiracism. In his 2019 book How to be an Anti-Racist , Kendi wrote: âThe only way to undo racism is to consistently identify and describe it â and then dismantle it.â\n\nHis books jumped onto bestseller lists in 2020, and he was on Timeâs list of 100 Most Influential People of 2020. Since then, the issue became a central culture war topic, and some parents and officials in multiple states have tried to ban some of his books from school libraries as part of a fight against âcritical race theory.â\n\nKendi previously taught at American University and the University of Florida.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor flagship"

      "text": "What the Trump abortion fight is really about\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nOn Wednesday night, after two days of perplexed questions about his new abortion position , Donald Trump did what came naturally. He declared victory.\n\nâThe states are handling it,â Trump said in a short video, insisting that by opposing a federal law limiting abortion heâd defanged the Democrats. âItâs totally killed that issue.â\n\nAlmost no one in politics acted as if Trump was right; not the Biden campaign, not anti-abortion activists, and not Republican candidates scrambling for a response to new abortion bans in Florida and Arizona. His attempt to answer that question prompted more questions about what else a second Trump White House could do with the rule-making authority that President Joe Biden has used to expand reproductive rights.\n\nThatâs a source of tension between his campaign, which has not been specific about the way Trump would exercise executive power on abortion âÂ and the people planning for his administration, who have.\n\nâWhy scare the hell out of voters over something thatâs not going to happen?â asked Mike Davis, a pro-Trump attorney and legal activist, referring to the Senate supermajority it would take to pass a federal abortion law. âThe rules will happen.â\n\nSince launching his third presidential bid, Trump has offered some specifics on how heâd use executive power to attack his top priorities â expelling illegal immigrants, putting tariffs on foreign goods, cutting funds for schools that teach âcritical race theory.â Heâs been more vague on abortion, even though conservative activists and policy scholars have laid out a litany of actions he could take next year.\n\nPlenty of their ideas were collected in âMandate for Leadership,â the policy book published by the Heritage Foundationâs Project 2025. Some of its contributors, like ex-Trump DOJ Office of Civil Rights head Roger Severino, have talked and written openly about what a restored Trump administration could do.\n\nBut five months ago, Trump campaign co-managers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles put out a statement distancing the campaign from the âlargely unfoundedâ stories about a second term agenda running in unnamed outlets â often The New York Times and Politico. They were, said the Trump team, âneither appropriate nor constructive,â about what a second Trump administration would do.\n\nâAny personnel lists, policy agendas, or government plans published anywhere are merely suggestions,â they wrote. âAll 2024 campaign policy announcements will be made by President Trump or members of his campaign team.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe list of potential anti-abortion measures Trump could enact is long but straightforward. Some items were acted on during his administration and reversed by Joe Biden; some start with the powers that Biden has used to expand abortion access, and use them to restrict it instead.\n\nâTheir creativity knows no bounds when it comes to pushing abortion on the American people,â Severino said on a Family Research Council podcast last year. âWhenever the word âpregnancyâ appears, they mean âabortion,â which of course violates common sense.â\n\nThe Trump campaign has refused to say how a second administration would interpret the Comstock Act, a set of 1873 laws that restrict the mailing of obscene materials. After the Dobbs decision, the Biden administration issued a legal guidance that protected the mailing of the abortion drugs mifepristone and misoprostol, judging that it didnât violate those laws. But in the Project 2025 handbook, Severino argued that a new conservative administration should âannounce its intent to enforce federal law against providers and distributors of such pills.â\n\nIn the Heritage Foundationâs assessment â Project 2025 is a joint effort with dozens of conservative groups, but Heritage condensed the basics â every action Biden took to go around state abortion limits can be reversed.\n\nâThe Biden self-proclaimed whole of government approach to promoting and mandating abortion would be replaced by a whole of government commitment to life-affirming support for pregnant women and parents,â said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, who was critical of Trump for coming out against any kind of federal abortion limit. âTrump would roll back Bidenâs funding for abortionists like Planned Parenthood at home and abroad. He would put an end to use of military and veteransâ resources for abortion and address the damage done when Biden rolled back safety standards for abortion drugs.â\n\nTrump, according to Project 2025âs report, could âeliminate the HHS Reproductive Healthcare Access Task Force,â which Biden created on Roeâ s 49th anniversary, âand install a pro-life task force to ensure that all of the departmentâs divisions seek to use their authority to promote the life and health of women and their unborn children.â\n\nHe could end Bidenâs Gender Policy Council, created on the day he took the reins from Trump, and thereby âeliminate central promotion of abortion (âhealth servicesâ); comprehensive sexuality education (âeducationâ); and the new woke gender ideology.â The expansion of abortion rights in veteransâ and military health programs, which Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville tried and failed to end by blocking military nominees, could be ended by the executive branch.\n\nThen thereâs the question of judges: Trump and other Republicans have distanced themselves from the Alabama court that effectively halted IVF treatment and the Arizona court that revived an 1864 territorial law criminalizing abortion, but the decisions came from GOP appointees from the same conservative movement that informed Trumpâs first term judicial overhaul. In 2016, he promised to appoint judges who would overturn Roe ; heâs yet to say what legal theories heâd keep in mind when making future picks. Would nominees whoâve backed âpersonhoodâ arguments like the one that roiled Alabama get through, for example?\n\nâTheyâve seen the backlash to extreme anti-abortion policies,â said Katie OâConnor, the director of federal abortion policy at the National Womenâs Law Center. âEven Trump is seeing the writing on the wall. Heâs not going to tip his hand on what he would implement. We know that heâd do what Severino asked him to.â\n\nThe clarity of these ideas, and Trumpâs evasiveness on specific abortion questions, has created a two-track campaign. In one of them, the Republican nominee is careful about taking potentially unpopular positions, and does most of his interviews with conservative media outlets that donât ask about them. In the other, policy advocates have explained exactly how Trump could act, sometimes admitting outright that it would be a mistake for the candidate to talk about it.\n\nâI hope he doesnât know about the existence of Comstock, because I just donât want him to shoot off his mouth,â Texas attorney Jonathan Mitchell told The New York Times, who has guided a legal strategy to ban the mailing of abortion medication. âI think the pro-life groups should keep their mouths shut as much as possible until the election.â\n\nOkay, set aside the irony of that quote. Trump did get through the Republican primary without answering any of these questions. Biden hasnât really faced questions, either; his actions to expand abortion access have been covered through the broader prism of abortion polling, which found most Americans unhappy with the Dobbs decision.\n\nâWe cannot allow an out-of-control Supreme Court, working in conjunction with the extremist elements of the Republican Party, to take away freedoms and our personal autonomy,â Biden said after Dobbs was handed down. Biden says all of this in public, and Trump doesnât respond.\n\nThe larger conservative movement may be getting more careful, too. The âfourth pillarâ of Project 2025 â pillars one through three cover policy and staffing â is an effort to write executive orders that Trump could implement immediately, robust enough that they couldnât be undermined by lawsuits or delay tactics. Unlike the rest of the project, itâs not been published, and may not be before the election.\n\nAny time the Biden-Harris ticket can talk about abortion, it does. The vice president will be in Arizona today, where sheâs expected to speak in more detail about what the administrationâs done on abortion rights and what Trump could undo.\n\nâDonald Trump unleashed this chaos on women in America, heâs proud of it, and his allies are planning more,â said campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika. âHis campaign isnât answering these questions about his plans to rip away access to reproductive health care nationwide because all of the answers are desperately unpopular with the American people.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Schools keep talking about critical race theory and DEI. What do those terms really mean?\n\n\"Social-emotional learning.\"\n\n\"Trauma-informed care.\"\n\n\"Culturally relevant teaching.\"\n\nLike most fields, K-12 education is filled with jargon. \"Critical race theory\" is often not on the vernacular list.\n\nBut as discord over how race is addressed in schools continues across the country, edu-speak phrases are increasingly being labeled as euphemisms for \"critical race theory.\"\n\nHere's a glossary of some of the most popular misnomers falsely believed to be critical race theory, plus what the terms actually mean.\n\nLet's get one definition out of the way first: Critical race theory is an academic framework that examines if, and how, systems and policies perpetuate racism.\n\nAnti-racism: Anti-racism is the practice of actively countering racism. It moves past passive practices - when someone says they are not racist but do not take action in the face of racist actions - and often requires conscious efforts.\n\n\"It's very binary,\" John Marshall, the chief equity officer for Jefferson County Public Schools, said. \"If you're not anti-racist, what are you?\"\n\nCulturally responsive teaching: This may also be called culturally relevant teaching.\n\nThis teaching approach, as described by scholar Geneva Gay, uses \"the cultural knowledge, prior experiences, frames of reference, and performance styles of ethnically diverse students to make learning encounters more relevant to and effective for them.\"\n\nDEI: This is an acronym for diversity, equity and inclusion. It is often used to lump all diversity, equity and inclusion programs a district or school may be implementing together.\n\nDiversity: Diversity is the practice of having a range of people represented in a group, including those from different races, ethnicities, socioeconomic classes, genders or sexual orientations.\n\nEquality: Equality is the concept that all people - or, in education's case, students - get the same opportunities and resources, regardless of need.\n\nEquity: Equity is when people - again, in this case, students - receive the supports and resources they need in order to be successful, even if that means people receive different levels of resources.\n\nIn cases of gender and racial equity , Eastern Kentucky University professor Roger Cleveland said, \"measures must often be put in place to compensate for the historical and social disadvantages\" that kept the playing field from being initially level.\n\nImplicit bias: Implicit bias, Cleveland said, \"refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner.\"\n\nThis is different than explicit bias, which is when a person is knowingly aware that they are discriminating against a set of people.\n\nInclusion: Inclusion takes diversity a step further, ensuring that a range of people are first represented and then feel valued in a group.\n\nIn education, this often includes understanding different students' needs and accommodating for those needs to allow a student to fully participate in school.\n\nIntersectionality: Intersectionality is the theory that a person's identities - including race, gender and class - don't act independently but are interconnected, creating a web of varying experiences with privilege and oppression.\n\nRestorative justice: This may also be called restorative practices .\n\nRestorative practices center on rebuilding relationships after harm has been done, with the belief that students are more likely to change their behavior once they understand its impact.\n\nThese practices can used as an alternative to discipline for smaller behavior issues in schools. They can also be used proactively to help students understand their emotions before a behavior issue happens.\n\nSocial-emotional learning: This is the process of how kids \"develop healthy identities, manage emotions and achieve personal and collective goals, feel and show empathy for others, establish and maintain supportive relationships, and make responsible and caring decisions,\" according to the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning.\n\nSystemic racism: Sometimes called institutional racism, this is when institutions like governments or school systems perpetuate racism and racial inequities through policies.\n\nTrauma-informed care: Trauma-informed care in education seeks to recognize signs of childhood trauma or adverse experiences in students to better help them.\n\nThis approach tries to move from asking \"What is wrong with this person?\" to \"What has happened to this person?\"\n\nWhite privilege: White privilege is the idea that Caucasian people inherently benefit from the color of their skin in some societies. Francis Kendall described white privilege as \"having greater access to power and resources than people of color do.\"\n\nWhite privilege does not mean everything a white person has accomplished was unearned, nor does it mean white people do not struggle.\n\nFollow Olivia Krauth on Twitter at @oliviakrauth ."

      "text": "Critical race theory: What is it, really?\n\nVarying definitions of critical race theory, or CRT, have circulated in online groups, public school board meetings and dinner conversations for the last several months.\n\nSome parents who oppose the theory say it shames white students into thinking they are \"racist\" or \"bad.\" Some proponents of the theory in schools say it helps with diversity and inclusion initiatives.\n\nBut do those arguments have anything to do with CRT, really?\n\nCRT, an academic field of study like philosophy, sociology or economics, has lived among us for years before the recent social media rants and heated debates. It hasn't lived in K-12 classrooms, experts say, but in academia.\n\nCRT scholars define the theory slightly differently, but at its core are three main components, said Rodney Coates, professor of global and intercultural studies at Miami University. Coates has been teaching sociology and social justice at Miami for 32 years, including courses on critical race.\n\nMore: What is critical race theory and why do Ohioans want to ban it?\n\nCoates' components:\n\nCoates said many people want to reduce racism to individuals.\n\n\"That's problematic,\" he said. And it's not CRT.\n\nCRT does not look at the behavior of individuals, Coates said. It does not analyze bias in specific people or events, but in processes.\n\nGary Peller, professor of law at Georgetown University, defines CRT as a lens or approach to understanding the role of race in American society. The theory was born after the Civil Rights Movement and began in legal studies in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n\"We began, in the 1980s, questioning the assertion of standards and the ideas of merit to see whether they really were race neutral or they were themselves tainted by a racial history, which is really what we concluded,\" Peller said.\n\nLegal scholars used the theory to start challenging claims that the legal system was neutral to race. Scholars in education and sociology caught wind of the theory and adopted it soon thereafter, Peller said.\n\nBut the way CRT is being discussed now in common dialogue is problematic, Coates said. We now have \"non experts\" on both sides trying to lead discussions without having studied CRT or having an understanding of its background and use.\n\nCRT can't be trademarked, Peller said. It will likely continue to be misused.\n\n\"Critical race theory has been made a kind of villain by Christopher Rufo, a kind of one-man campaign to exploit white anxiety about race,\" Peller said. \"And he's kind of pinned everything on critical race theory.\"\n\nRufo is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and director of its critical race theory initiative. He's written in a USA TODAY opinion column that CRT is a form of \"race-based Marxism\" and is, in K-12 schools, a \"form of state-sanctioned racism.\"\n\nFollowing last summer's protests in response to the killing of George Floyd, Peller said, many institutions have given more attention to race, including perhaps in K-12 curriculum. But efforts to include the viewpoints of different races in history lessons are not necessarily CRT - that's just telling American history, Peller said.\n\nNo, according to Coates and Peller.\n\nDiversity and inclusion initiatives and trainings focus on the behaviors of individuals.\n\nCRT focuses on systems, structures and policies. CRT does not blame people for acts of racism, but looks to systems for change.\n\nCoates said current individuals cannot be held responsible for their entire race, their history or their family - which is why diversity and inclusion trainings focused on individual change \"don't work\" and are not in line with CRT.\n\nNo. Both Coates and Peller said CRT is too complex to be taught in K-12 classrooms.\n\n\"These are college-level conversations,\" Coates said.\n\nHe said some of his top students at Miami still struggle with the ideas of CRT.\n\n\"The idea that it would be easily taught in K-12 is kind of ... it doesn't really make any sense to me,\" Peller said. \"It's hard stuff. It's asking you to critically examine assumptions that we all make. And so if it were being taught in K-12 I would think it would be a cause for wild celebration that teachers (were) doing such a fantastic job.\"\n\nNonetheless, bills aimed at banning CRT from K-12 schools have been introduced in many states, including Kentucky and Ohio . The bills have similar language. Both bills, if approved, would prohibit school districts and teachers from discussing, promoting or otherwise using materials on a dozen topics, including:\n\nIn late June, Gallatin County School District became one of the first districts in Kentucky to ban CRT . District superintendent Larry Hammond wrote that the board's decision reflected its desire to not create \"greater divisions\" among students and staff.\n\n\"The Board also believes no individual is 'inherently racist, sexist or oppressive' due to their race or sex, 'whether consciously or unconsciously,'\" Hammond's statement to The Enquirer reads.\n\nMore: Why did Gallatin County Schools ban critical race theory? No one 'is inherently racist.'\n\nIn Ohio, anti-CRT protests erupted in Anderson Township outside of Forest Hills School board meetings in May and June, though district Superintendent Scot Prebles said CRT is a doctoral-level theory and promised it would not be intentionally taught to district students or staff.\n\n\"Notice I said not intentionally,\" Prebles said."

      "text": "Trump's orders take aim at critical race theory and antisemitism on college campuses\n\nManage your account\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump is ordering U.S. schools to stop teaching what he views as \"critical race theory\" and other material dealing with race and sexuality or risk losing their federal money.\n\nA separate plan announced Wednesday calls for aggressive action to fight antisemitism on college campuses , promising to prosecute offenders and revoke visas for international students found to be \"Hamas sympathizers.\"\n\nBoth plans were outlined in executive orders signed by Trump on Wednesday. The measures seek to fulfill some of the Republican president's core campaign promises around education, though it's unclear how much power he has to enact the proposals.\n\nHis order on K-12 schools declares that federal money cannot be used on the \"indoctrination\" of children, including \"radical gender ideology and critical race theory.\" It says civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex and race would be used to enforce the order, calling critical race theory an \"inherently racist policy.\"\n\nExamples cited by the White House include a policy at Harrisonburg City Public Schools in Virginia requiring teachers to use students' preferred names and pronouns. Another policy at Madison Metropolitan School District in Wisconsin says schools should \"disrupt the gender binary\" by teaching students to embrace different gender identities, according to the order.\n\nMichael Richards, superintendent of Harrisonburg schools, said the district has no policy that indoctrinates children or violates anyone's rights.\n\n\"What we do have is a culture of respect - one that honors the dignity and diversity of all students, families, and educators,\" Richards said in a statement. \"I will not be intimidated. I stand firm in my commitment to ensuring that HCPS remains a safe, welcoming place for all.\"\n\nThe Education Department's Office for Civil Rights investigates allegations of civil rights violations and can impose sanctions up to a total loss of federal money, though that penalty has almost never been used and must be approved by a judge.\n\nThe order unfairly tarnishes teachers and makes it harder for them to do their jobs, said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers.\n\n\"Today is a sad day because the Trump administration is doing exactly what it accuses others of: creating division and fear in classrooms across America,\" she said.\n\nTrump also directs the education secretary to craft a strategy within 90 days to \"end indoctrination in K-12 education.\" Trump has appointed billionaire professional wrestling mogul Linda McMahon as his education chief, but her Senate confirmation hearing has not been scheduled.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump said he would sign an order \"on day one\" to cut federal money for schools that push critical race theory or other \"inappropriate\" content. The federal government provides billions of dollars to schools every year, though the vast majority of their money comes from state and local sources.\n\nThe measure taps into a wave of conservative anger that has taken aim at classroom lessons that some see as too liberal. A growing number of Republican states have adopted laws or rules barring the teaching of critical race theory or \"divisive concepts\" in public schools and universities.\n\nOpponents say the rules impose vague restrictions on teachers and create a chilling effect on discussions about history and other subjects.\n\nThe term \"critical race theory\" is used by conservatives as a catchall for subjects they don't want to be taught in the classroom, though, in reality, it refers to a complex academic and legal framework centered on the idea that racism is embedded in the nation's systems.\n\nTrey Walk, a researcher and advocate with Human Rights Watch, said students have a right to learn about how discrimination can be entrenched in law and society. \"If the US denies young people this knowledge, it has little hope of eradicating racism,\" he said.\n\nTrump's plan to fight antisemitism would \"marshal all federal resources\" and bring immediate action from the Justice Department to investigate and punish offenders on U.S. campuses. It calls for the deportation of nonresident aliens who \"violate our laws,\" citing previous threats by Trump to revoke student visas for international students who attended pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nTrump's action promises to \"protect law and order, quell pro-Hamas vandalism and intimidation, and investigate and punish anti-Jewish racism in leftist, anti-American colleges and universities.\"\n\nIt drew swift backlash from civil rights groups who said campus protests have mostly been peaceful and are protected by constitutional free speech rights.\n\nEdward Ahmed Mitchell, national deputy director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the action is discriminatory and wrongly characterizes protesters as \"pro-jihadist\" or \"pro-Hamas.\"\n\n\"These college students were Jewish, Muslim, Black, Palestinian and various other races who were simply protesting what they viewed as a genocide in Gaza,\" Mitchell said. \"They are no different than the students who protested Vietnam or segregation or apartheid in South Africa.\"\n\nTensions over the Israel-Hamas war led to emotional demonstrations on U.S. campuses, including a wave of pro-Palestinian tent encampments that led to some 3,200 arrests .\n\nThe Biden administration opened more than 100 investigations into alleged antisemitism and Islamophobia at schools and universities after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel. A flurry of schools reached deals to settle the cases before Trump took office amid fears that he would issue heavier sanctions.\n\nThe White House on Wednesday also reinstated an order from Trump's first term establishing the 1776 Commission to promote \"patriotic education\" in U.S. schools.\n\nBiden revoked the order and the commission's guide for teaching history. The guide played down America's role in slavery and argued that the civil rights movement ran afoul of the \"lofty ideals\" espoused by the Founding Fathers. It was widely panned by historians, who said it was outdated and ignored decades of research.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Jocelyn Gecker in San Francisco contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

      "text": "How critical race theory bans are fueling debates on education and identity\n\nManage your account\n\n\"The 360\" shows you diverse perspectives on the day's top stories and debates.\n\nThe origin of racism in American history is part of an ongoing national debate as lawmakers, experts and educators advocate for and against the teaching of critical race theory (CRT) in schools across the country.\n\n\"It's a framework of analysis in which we utilize race as a sociological concept in order to understand the dynamics of a society,\" Dr. Vida Robertson, director of the Center for Critical Race Studies at the University of Houston-Downtown, told Yahoo News.\n\nBut lately the theory is often used to define any teaching that incorporates race. \"Critical race theory is being utilized as a catch-all for all socially conscious or racially critical examinations of society,\" Robertson said.\n\nThe theory sparked controversy following the murder of George Floyd and the 1619 project , a docseries featured on Hulu and a series of essays published in the New York Times Magazine that analyze the impact of slavery on American life.\n\nAdditionally, \" Trump signed an executive order [in September 2020] , that was a cascading effect of lots of people using very similar language to introduce bills all around the country,\" Jane Bolgatz, professor of social studies education at the Fordham University Graduate School of Education and author of \"Talking Race in the Classroom,\" told Yahoo News.\n\nMost recently, on June 8, Arizona school superintendent Tom Horne , who created a hotline for people to notify leadership of improper teachings, says he was alerted to teachers' professional development courses teaching about critical race theory, claiming there is \"enough CRT in our schools to constitute a problem.\"\n\nEfforts to ban critical race theory are widespread, as dozens of states have passed legislation and more than 40 have introduced it. \"It's a concerted effort. The laws that are being proposed in all these states have very similar wording,\" Bolgatz said.\n\nExperts say racism is a part of our society that cannot be ignored.\n\n\"Many that are condemning critical race theory haven't read it or studied it intensely. This is largely predicated on fear: the fear of losing power and influence and privilege,\" Jonathan Chism, assistant professor of history at the University of Houston-Downtown, told NBC News . \"The larger issue that this is all stemming from is a desire to deny the truth about America, about racism.\"\n\nAccording to some experts, critical race theory is indeed an attack on America - a necessary one. \"It is very un-American. It goes against every fiber of who we imagined we are, and everything that we ever hoped that we would be,\" Robertson said.\n\nCritics argue that teaching critical race theory instills the notion that one race is better than another. \"We should not teach that one race is inferior to another,\" Texas Republican state House Rep. Steve Toth said in an interview with ABC News.\n\nBut experts say the theory does not teach that any one race is superior - instead it highlights centuries of systematic racism. \"Critical race theory itself is just saying racism exists, you can't be colorblind,\" Bolgatz said. \"We live in a society where your color does make a difference as to what you get, and what you earn and the wealth that you have, because of the ways that race and racism have existed for hundreds of years and continue to exist.\"\n\nSome argue that lessons on racism and oppression in the U.S is a part of history that can not be forgotten or overlooked.\n\nAndrew Hartman, a history professor at Illinois State University, describes the ongoing debate as a culture war. \"I think it's been a useful sort of political tool. Especially for some right-wing legislators like [New York Rep. George] Santos, [Florida Gov. Ron] DeSantis, and other conservative states. There have been a number of Republican-controlled state boards of education that have outlawed critical race theory,\" Hartman told Yahoo News.\n\nFor states that have already passed legislation to ban critical race theory, some experts say those students are being taught a less holistic picture of history. \"It's harmful,\" Hartman said.\n\n\"The polarization that we're currently experiencing is likely to just increase,\" he added. \"I think having American students learning a completely different curriculum, depending on where they grow up, is not great.\"\n\n'Unravels the American myth'\n\n\"Critical race theory was simply an analytical tool, but to some white people, the fact that white supremacy was overtly used to infect America's systems of power with both racial oppressions and racial privileges is too much to handle. It is discomforting. It unravels the American myth. But critical race theory doesn't diagnose the country as evil, even though it is beyond dispute that some evil people designed the architecture of racial oppression in this country and that there are still some who help maintain it.\" - Charles Blow, opinion columnist for the New York Times.\n\nYouth should be aware of America's 'mistakes'\n\n\"It is important for young people to know that America is a nation that has made mistakes, particularly in oppressing various groups, but also that America has made changes to correct wrongs and will always need to correct wrongs.\" the Rev. Robert Montgomery, who holds a PhD in the social scientific studies of religion, told the Asheville Citizen Times.\n\nAffirmative action and critical race theory\n\n\"Affirmative action has helped fuel the notion that Americans cannot rise above the kind of racism that existed decades and centuries past. It is perhaps the most pessimistic of policies promulgated by what used to be an optimistic country. Democrats need affirmative action, DEI, critical race theory and intersectionality to be a crutch for liberal policies that have failed to support economic and social mobility for minorities. They're fine with perpetuating the placing of race above the personal circumstances of each individual,\" Tom Basile, host of \"American Right Now,\" told the Washington Times.\n\nRacism is in Americans' DNA\n\n\"Thankfully the practitioners of Critical Race Theory - who view neither the Founding Fathers nor the revolution as \"sacred\" - are confronting and debunking all such myths and misrepresentations of America's beginnings in quick succession. And they are not attempting to be apolitical or objective while doing so.

      "text": "President Trump signs executive order banning critical race theory in K-12 schools\n\nManage your account\n\nWASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) - President Donald Trump has signed an executive order banning the teaching of critical race theory (CRT) in K-12 schools, a move his administration says is aimed at refocusing American education on fundamental subjects such as math and reading. Schools that continue CRT-related lessons risk losing federal aid.\n\n\"The president believes American education should focus on cultivating patriotic citizens who are ready for the workforce,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\n\nThe executive order follows the release of the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress, which showed reading scores declining and math scores stagnating nationwide in 2024. The White House argues that classroom time should be dedicated to core subjects rather than discussions on race and systemic inequality.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) praised the executive action, arguing that lessons portraying the U.S. as founded on slavery are inaccurate.\n\n\"I don't want that propaganda taught to my kids or any kid in Missouri,\" Hawley said.\n\nThe administration's move has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats and educators. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) dismissed the order as a political maneuver, stating, \"I don't know a single school in Michigan that teaches critical race theory.\" She emphasized that addressing learning loss from the pandemic should be a higher priority.\n\nFederal data indicates that student performance has suffered in the wake of COVID-19, with test scores dropping despite the U.S. spending $190 billion to keep public schools running during the pandemic.\n\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, echoed Slotkin's concerns, calling for increased support for educators.\n\n\"Let's actually give the teachers the support they need to do the job to help lift up all of America's children,\" Weingarten said.\n\nRepublicans in Congress, meanwhile, continue efforts to scale back the Department of Education, arguing for a reduced federal role in local school curricula.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

      "text": "Why is critical race theory so threatening to white people?\n\nManage your account\n\nOPINION: Kimberlé Crenshaw, one of the founders of critical race theory talks about what it means for it to become so controversial\n\nEditor's note: The following article is an op-ed, and the views expressed are the author's own. Read more opinions on theGrio.\n\nCritical race theory, also known as CRT, has gone from a way of explaining the impact that racism has had on American life to some kind of monster that represents any discussion of race whatsoever.\n\nThe right has demonized and weaponized CRT and created laws banning the teaching of America's racial history. This is a very serious issue for Black people and for our children. Where do we go from here? I called my friend Kimberlé Crenshaw to talk about this topic. As a professor at UCLA and Columbia Law and one of the founding members of the field, Crenshaw is a leading scholar of critical race theory and is largely considered one of the smartest people in America.\n\nTouré: So, you've been central in advancing and explaining and articulating the notion of critical race theory, but in the years since you first articulated it, CRT has become this political football. A lot of times when the right is talking about critical race theory, they're not talking about the concept that you defined. They're talking about some entirely separate thing. Where is CRT now that this phantom definition has gotten baked into what it means?\n\nKimberlé Crenshaw: Well, the right isn't really having a debate about critical race theory. This is about the right weaponizing critical race theory to attack any anti-discrimination practices and more broadly to attack multiracial democracy itself. So we have to understand it in those terms.\n\nBut I think the first thing is to set the context out of which the campaign to attack critical race Theory originated; that tells us a lot about why the distortions have been a central part of the right-wing strategies. That campaign came about in the aftermath of the most significant mobilization against racial Injustice in our lifetime. In 2020, after the murder of George Floyd, millions of people hit the streets all across the country. Whenever there's a significant advance toward a true multiracial democracy, whenever there's an appearance that momentum is growing to actually shift in our direction, there's a backlash. Sometimes that backlash is more powerful and lasts longer than the momentum that produced it. In the backlash, racial aggression is framed as self-defense against the forward, momentum wave.\n\nT: Are those of us who care about race, and racial history, and critical race theory and those sorts of things-are we not losing this battle in the wake of laws being passed around the country that ban teaching CRT and ban teaching racial history? In limiting what teachers can say about race and racism, are we not losing something vital? There are now classrooms where the truth about American history cannot be discussed.\n\nKC: We are absolutely losing. If you can't understand or name what the battle is that you're in, then it's hard to show up to do battle. But for parents of color, Black parents in particular, they practice critical race theory all the time. You sit your kids down for 'the talk,' you're talking about critical race theory. It means you're aware of the legacies of racism. We continue to shape our lives based on it and you'd be crazy to act as though we don't. If you didn't, you'd be totally ill-prepared to navigate life in this country as a Black or brown person. So our objective is to allow people to see that critical race theory isn't some alien abstraction; it's the sum total of our experiences.\n\nCritical race theory came out of us coming into these institutions and saying the problem isn't just racist people. The problem is in the law and the problem is in sociology and education. It's all of these institutions that were created when we were not part of them and they justified us not being a part of them. So now, we're going after the structures of justification.\n\nT: As a teacher, does it break your heart to see lawmakers saying 'You teachers can't talk about racism?'\n\nKC: Yes, my heart is broken for Black and brown children whose interests are being completely thrown under the bus. For example, we're all excited about the fact that we finally have a Black woman on the Supreme Court-but under these laws, many teachers are not allowed to explain to children why she's the first African-American woman on the Supreme Court. They're not able to talk about racism in the past or the way it plays out. They're not able to explain how discrimination and stereotypes and a variety of other implicit biases made it unlikely until this moment for a Black woman to be appointed to the Supreme Court.\n\nNow, if you don't know anything about the exclusion of Black people and exclusion of women and how that comes together to exclude Black women when the first Black woman gets appointed like thirty years after the first white woman does, if you don't have an explanation for why that is, what are you going to infer? You're going to infer that there's something wrong with us, you're going to infer that you don't work as hard as us, right? So there is damage from the ignorance.\n\nT: One last thing. What do we do now that critical race theory is this bogeyman that's been redefined by the right and there's these laws that we have to fight against? How do we adjust at this stage of the battle?\n\nKC: They are after our ability to name our experience. If you can't name your experience, you can't fix it, you can't address it. You can't legitimately talk about it. So, number one is just recognizing the fact that they're trying to take away our ability to testify and that has been part of the history of racism for as long as we've been here. The second thing is we have to be aware of what is not being taught in our schools. What is being taught is the idea that this country was born perfect and it kept improving. That's not true. There are millions of dollars that are being put to erasing our ability to tell our stories and to teach our children. We have to do what we've always done - we've got to find a way to make a way.\n\nTouré is a host and Creative Director at theGrio.

      "text": "Wrenching struggle to define critical race theory divides an Orange County school district\n\nManage your account\n\nInside a wood-clad meeting room in Orange County, five school board members sat before a sign-waving, opinionated crowd. For more than three hours, the trustees listened, debated and asked questions as they tried to decide whether to ban classroom teaching on a hard-to-define topic not taught in their schools: critical race theory.\n\nThe board members of the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District had even turned to the trusted pages of the Encyclopedia Britannica , copying the entry for critical race theory into a public resolution that could become the legal policy of the district.\n\n\"I don't think that this definition is really good,\" trustee Marilyn Anderson said after reading the dense entry. \"I think it needs to be really specific. It needs to spell out the specific theories that we do not want taught in our district - like that the United States is fundamentally or systemically racist.\"\n\nAt the end of a long night, the board postponed the vote. But what emerged during their session revealed far more than angst over a \"yes\" or \"no\" vote on whether to ban critical race theory. Their meeting offered an up-close look at how an advanced academic concept has been transformed into a politicized slogan framing uncomfortable discussions about how to teach race, racism and equity in schools - and how the quest to define it inside a suburban school board meeting can be a minefield.\n\nCritical race theory is a university-level academic lens for examining how racial inequality and racism are historically embedded in legal systems, policies and institutions in America and is not generally taught in K-12 schools. Yet Republicans have seized on it as a wedge issue painting white people as racist oppressors and people of color as the oppressed. Democrats largely see the conservative drive against critical race theory as racist dog-whistle politics that polarizes broader discussions about reckoning with America's past.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, school board members and parents in suburban Placentia-Yorba Linda are trying to figure it all out for their kids.\n\nAlthough ultimately designed to ban critical race theory, the district's 14-point resolution was touted as a way to foster a \"safe and respectful environment for students.\" It said the district \"stands by the commitment to teach a complete and accurate account of history while also supporting the cultural integrity of students.\"\n\nAmong the issues considered during the discussion were whether the district should promote \"equity\" or \"equality\"; whether to include the word \"multiculturalism\"; and whether it was appropriate to strive to \"free students from the historical transgressions of the past.\"\n\nThe public comments at the meeting were nearly evenly split between those in favor and those opposed to what they believed critical race theory stands for. The vast majority of students who spoke, including students of color, opposed the ban and supported their ethnic studies class, currently an elective course in high school.\n\n\"I have learned that people like me can make history - something I never thought I would be able to learn within the American education system,\" one student told the board.\n\nCritical race theory often becomes mixed up with ethnic studies , a different academic discipline that seeks to guide students in both K-12 and college courses through the histories, struggles and contributions of Black, Latino, Asian and Indigenous Americans. Earlier this year, California became the first state in the nation to make ethnic studies a course requirement for high school graduation in 2030 - and educators in each district can design their course with guidance from a state-approved framework.\n\nIn September, Placentia-Yorba Linda made headlines when a Yorba Linda High School student held a handmade poster reading \" Ur dad is my gardener \" before a football game against a high school with a more sizable Latino student population. About 44% of Placentia-Yorba Linda's 23,000 students are Hispanic or Latino and 31% white, the two largest populations. Some in the community pointed to the incident as an urgent call for more education around diversity and anti-racism.\n\nThe school board narrowly approved the development of its current ethnic studies elective earlier this year. It also approved a resolution condemning racism in 2020.\n\nIt's unclear what the board will decide to do about critical race theory. Some trustees, including Anderson, Leandra Blades and Shawn Youngblood, have been vocal about their opposition to it. Blades has also been criticized for attending the Jan. 6 Trump rally in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe tenor of the meeting was at times sharp, but civil. Some attendees applauded for those who agreed with them and murmured disapproval for those who did not. Board members volleyed over several terms, including a point in the resolution that promoted \"honoring the experiences of all students by encouraging instruction that appropriately explores multiculturalism.\"\n\nAnderson asked if the word \"multiculturalism\" could be replaced with the phrase, \"the history, philosophy and structures which comprise the American experience.\"\n\nBoard President Karin Freeman said multiculturalism was a logical term because it will be included in the title of the ethnic studies elective, but tentatively agreed to the substitution.\n\n\"Equity\" and \"equality\" were also on the table as the board discussed whether to use one or both terms. Some argued that achieving equity was possible, but that true equality was harder to obtain.\n\nThe board ultimately decided to insert both words and wait for their attorneys to weigh in.\n\nBut defining critical race theory remained a centerpiece of conversation. The lengthy encyclopedia entry used in the draft describes it as \"an intellectual and social movement and loosely organized framework of legal analysis based on the premise that race is not a natural, biologically grounded feature of physically distinct subgroups of human beings but a socially constructed (culturally invented) category that is used to oppress and exploit people of color.\"\n\nYoungblood, too, said they should spell out the specific components they oppose - including any curriculum material promoting or endorsing ideas such as \"white supremacy,\" \"privilege,\" \"microaggressions,\" or \"anything that's going to disparage one particular race.\"\n\nBlades agreed, and said that in lieu of the encyclopedia definition they should instead add bullet points about what won't be taught, and how they \"won't be pitting the races against each other.\"\n\nIn one respectful exchange, they discussed hypothetical situations that could careen into the classroom.\n\nBoard Vice President Carrie Buck worried that the proposed limitations could hinder discussions and foster confusion. She gave an example of a guest speaker who talked to students about her experiences as a woman of color. Buck wondered whether that conversation would be off-limits in the future because it touches on intersectionality, or the overlapping of social identities.\n\n\"I wouldn't think we would be eliminating that,\" Youngblood said. \"I would think if it was a woman, a person of color, that came in and is talking about her success ... \"\n\nBuck interjected: \"But what if she talks about the downfalls before she gets to success? Is that OK?\"\n\n\"That's absolutely OK,\" Youngblood responded, \"but I think where it gets to be problematic is to say, 'I had to do this and all the whites were keeping me down, and there was no way in which I could do it because the whole system is racist.' That would be wrong.\"\n\nRaquel Fleischman, a mother of three students in the district, said she was concerned by the ambiguity of the proposed ban. She worried that the resolution was so vague that any mention of - or questions surrounding - race could potentially fall under its umbrella of exclusion.\n\n\"There's so much left up in the air about what it even is,\" Fleischman said before the meeting. \"If we can't even come to an agreement about what it is, then how can we ban it? In general, there aren't many resolutions to ban anything in teaching.\"\n\nOne father, Miguel Lopez, emphasized that critical race theory is not being taught in the district at any level, but has instead become \"this catchall that is all-encompassing when we talk about issues of race in this country.\"\n\n\"It has this chilling effect - not just here in this district, but across the country - where things that we're trying to discuss, that we need to discuss, regarding race and racism, are just not being taught,\" he said.\n\nBut others were strongly opposed to critical race theory, and urged the board to approve the resolution on the table. Some threatened to pull their kids from the district lest they become \"indoctrinated.\"\n\n\"By separating children by race - and insinuating that some are holding others back by perpetuating some sort of systemic racism - doesn't this create division and hatred?\" asked Jan Templin. \"I don't think it creates friends.\"\n\nAnother, who gave her name as Amy S., said critical race theory \"perpetuates the victim mindset,\" and worried that the teachings implied that white children should be discriminated against in order to make up for mistakes of the past.\n\nThe resolution is back on the drafting table and likely to return in December or January, officials said.\n\nTheresa Montaño, a professor of Chicana and Chicano Studies at Cal State Northridge who helped craft an early draft of the state's ethnic studies curriculum, was not surprised to hear that officials couldn't settle on a definition of critical race theory. School boards looking to ban the concept are often \"responding to a body politic that's attacking critical race theory, but they have no knowledge of what it is,\" she said. \"Bans have become a means to \"attack some of the civil rights gains like ethnic studies, like anti-racist education .\"\n\n\"You have to look at the underlying messaging and underlying concepts that [these boards] are really trying to negotiate,\" Montaño said.\n\nBoard members in Placentia-Yorba Linda did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDuring the meeting, retired teacher and district administrator Nancy Watkins told the board that critical race theory has been \"emptied of meaning,\" and is being used as a placeholder for many issues relating to equity, social justice and even politics.\n\n\"This resolution attempts to take a complex issue that few people understand, define it with an Encyclopedia Britannica definition, and create two polar bad options: We either ban CRT or we teach CRT,\" she said. \"The truth is not reflected in either of those extreme choices.\"\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times ."

It targets what the politicians say are concepts found in critical race theory, a decades-old idea that considers the ways race and racism influence American politics, culture, and law.\n\n\"One of the things this legislation and others around the country is causing is keeping the silence [about racism] ... and that's harmful for all of us but most particularly students of color,\" she says.\n\nA tug of war over the teaching of American history and race is playing out in state legislatures. Given the chasm between views on either side, what is the best path forward?\n\nMs. Steenman, who lives in Franklin, Tennessee, and runs a local chapter of the national group Moms for Liberty, has a different view. She sees critical race theory as an effort to sow strife among Americans and overturn racial progress.\n\n\"It seeks to divide along racial lines,\" she says. \"When you start bringing up critical race theory and bringing up skin color, you ... go back to neo-racism and neo-segregation and it's a tragedy.\"\n\nA culture war is heating up just as students and teachers are starting to break for summer. Stoking the divisiveness is a push by conservative politicians to focus on critical race theory and whether its tenets are adversely affecting school climate and should be prohibited. Arguments for and against the approach do not always track precisely along political, racial, or ideological lines. In general, those in favor of the new laws want more restrictions as classroom discussions and hastily implemented anti-racist lesson plans have taken hold in the past year. Those opposed say statehouse rules could have a chilling effect on conversation about racism and race in schools just when it is needed most.\n\nA key step toward finding middle ground will be if opponents can agree to \"let kids in on the secret that we disagree,\" and allow teachers to present both sides of the debate in class, says Jonathan Zimmerman, a professor of the history of education at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\"The debate isn't about whether there's been racism; it's about what racism has meant and what it's done to America. Is it something that's been progressively overcome as we move toward fulfilling our national ideals, or is it something that's been a constant force in society, making society itself irredeemably racist?\" says Professor Zimmerman, author of \"Whose America?: Culture Wars in the Public Schools.\" \"What we need is for each side to have the courage to let that debate happen in our classrooms.\"\n\nNationally, the discussion of race shows no sign of abating. This week the United States is remembering the 100th anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre - one of the worst incidents of race-related violence in the country's history. It's an event that Americans by and large learned little about in school, as actor Tom Hanks wrote in an opinion piece Friday. Former Vice President Mike Pence also weighed in on the subject in a speech on Thursday calling systemic racism a \"left-wing myth.\"\n\nTo date, conservative politicians in 16 states have introduced legislation aimed at prohibiting concepts they cite as divisive and often attribute to critical race theory. So far, bills have passed into law in Arkansas, Idaho, Oklahoma, and Tennessee. A Texas bill is awaiting the governor's signature. Many school board meetings and elections are seeing robust parent turnout, spurred by disputes, in part, over critical race theory and anti-racist curricula.\n\nOf the bills introduced or passed so far, three out of the 16 include the words \"critical race theory.\" Most of the bills do not seek to ban teaching it as an academic subject, but instead often prohibit teaching that individuals are \"inherently\" racist based on their sex or race, for example. The Dallas Independent School District is considering legal action in response to the legislation in Texas, which it opposed .\n\nThe change is partly in response to efforts initiated by school districts in the past year after the murder of George Floyd in police custody, such as diversity, inclusion, and equity initiatives; anti-bias training; and anti-racist curricula. Schools are poorly implementing well-intentioned efforts to address racism, some critics say. They point to instances such as third grade students reportedly ranking themselves on their power and privilege, or training materials that suggest focusing on the \"right answer\" in math is a sign of white supremacy culture.\n\n\"The vast majority of parents think kids should do homework, get grades, show their work ... because these are healthy, structurally responsible, sensible things to do,\" says Frederick Hess, director of education policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C.\n\nConservative groups seek to associate critical race theory with Marxism and The New York Times' 1619 Project, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalistic effort to rethink slavery's role in America's founding.\n\nWith no national standardized history or social studies curricula, and no national data collection, it's not clear how many teachers across the country's 13,000 school districts are teaching critical race theory as an academic concept, or how many districts are implementing anti-racist practices. A nationally representative survey by EdWeek Research Center in August 2020 found that 81% of educators identify themselves as \"anti-racist/abolitionist\" educators and 84% are very or somewhat willing to teach or support the implementation of anti-racist curricula.\n\n\"There's a fear among classroom teachers,\" says Marvin Lynn, dean of the college of education at Portland State University and co-founder of the Critical Race Studies in Education Association. He says teachers now wonder, \"Can I talk about race, gender, difficult parts of American history, or do I need to ignore that?\"\n\nMs. Steenman, in Tennessee, says that \"there are lots of lessons to learn in history,\" including slavery and Jim Crow. But she worries about where the emphasis falls. \"There's mistakes that we've made, but there are also redemptive elements. When you only teach the mistakes and not redemption, [students] will be ashamed of their country,\" she says.\n\nCritical race theory and anti-racist education policies are being misrepresented, say those who oppose the laws, noting that beliefs such as the idea that the theory teaches that individuals should be adversely treated on the basis of their sex, race, or ethnicity are not part of instruction.\n\nComplicating the situation is that people are following different definitions, says Richard Delgado, one of the founders of critical race theory, an academic framework developed by legal scholars in the U.S. in the 1970s in response to what some saw as a stalling of civil rights gains.\n\n\"I'm concerned that it's becoming a conservative talking point that's not based on any sort of a deep knowledge or interest in critical race theory as a scholarly movement,\" says Professor Delgado, who teaches at the University of Alabama School of Law and co-wrote \"Critical Race Theory: An Introduction.\"\n\nBasic tenets of critical race theory include the premises that racism is \"ordinary, not aberrational,\" that it \"is difficult to address or cure because it is not acknowledged,\" and that \"race and races are products of social thought and relations,\" according to Professor Delgado's book, co-written by Jean Stefancic. Critical race theorists are frustrated with principles such as colorblindness and believe \"only aggressive, color-conscious efforts to change the way things are will do much to ameliorate misery.\"\n\nOpponents of the legislation like Dr. Lynn say it's already creating confusion for teachers and students - and stifling discussion.\n\nOklahoma City Community College has canceled a summer course on race and ethnicity pending review of the state's new legislation, they note, with the news of the cancellation coming a few days before the centennial of the Tulsa race massacre. They also point overall to evidence suggesting that educators can struggle with bias, including recent news reports of a teacher allegedly penning white supremacist articles, and point to ongoing inequities in education such as higher discipline rates for students of color.\n\nWhile divisions over the issue remain significant, some people argue for continuing discussion.\n\nYvonne Shen, a 14-year-old student in Boise, Idaho, recently attended the debate over Idaho House Bill 377 with several friends. Together, they started the Idaho AAPI (Asian American Pacific Islanders) Youth Alliance in March after an increase in anti-Asian attacks. Yvonne was intrigued by the legislative debate, but disappointed by the bill's passage.\n\n\"I feel like talking about racism and getting the conversation started is something that everyone should agree on,\" says Yvonne.\n\nShe points to an example when a classmate at the start of the pandemic urged peers not to go near her because she's from China. \"I was kind of shocked,\" she says. \"In order to face [racism] we need to talk about it ourselves so we can be actively fighting it.\" She suggests using a more inclusive history curriculum that better represents Asian Americans and other underrepresented groups.\n\nDiscussing specific books and elements of curricula can help embattled school communities move forward, says Dr. Hess. \"Everything gets more divisive when it's abstract,\" but there's more clarity if people come together for a concrete conversation about materials and incorporating multiple perspectives, he says.\n\nHe has found agreement with others on areas such as teaching a \"full, unflinching\" history of America, examining disparate rates of school discipline and policing by racial groups, expanding the narrative of whose voices are included in historical accounts, and expanding access to advanced-level classes.\n\nFor Professor Delgado, activities that bring people together across racial lines are an important way to foster common humanity and make progress, even though he also believes racism is found at a systemic level in institutions and not solely among individuals.\n\n\"I think it happens through everyday events,\" such as youth sports, he says. \"With exposure, people become comfortable with diversity and stop attributing evil motives to each other.\"\n\nAshley Lipscomb, a former middle school teacher who co-founded the New Jersey-based Institute for Anti-Racist Education last summer, says she's \"struggling\" to find common ground in the heated critical race theory debate, but hopes she and others can practice listening and loving.\n\n\"I wonder if the common ground, when we think about it in schools, is wanting the best for students, for every student, not just some,\" says Ms. Lipscomb, who also serves as a youth minister in her church. \"We can go beyond whatever fears about what's being taught and listen to those who say, 'I need you to hear me; I've been hurt for years.' The common ground may be active listening.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in\n\nMonitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in.

In his latest offering, \"Entertaining Race: Performing Blackness in America,\" the Vanderbilt University professor discusses not only the rich history of a marginalized group but also the societal expectations placed on Black people. From being brought to America on slave ships against their will to having their culture usurped on a national stage, Black people have been fighting for their livelihoods for centuries. Dr. Dyson spoke with Monitor correspondent Candace McDuffie about his latest project and why everyone should be invested in having conversations about these subjects.\n\nQ: At this point in your career - 24 books in - you've written about everything from why you love Black women to the legacy of Jay-Z. Is it easy for you to find different ways to explore Blackness in your works?\n\nBlackness itself is endlessly fascinating. It has multitudes of dimensions - the magnitude of which can never be exhausted by a singular approach. I'm always astonished by new and valuable lessons that one can learn from studying Blackness, so I've always held out the possibility that something fresh will crease the horizon and capture your attention. I'm curious about the evolution of Blackness, the anatomy of Blackness, the structures and the spirit of Blackness, and how it continues to goad us on to think more sharply and critically about the different ways in which it manifests itself in our culture.\n\nConversations around race have many entry points. With his latest book, scholar and commentator Michael Eric Dyson aims to remove some of the obstacles that prevent people from joining the discussion.\n\nQ: Why do you think America has this undying obsession with Blackness and, as the title of your book states, performing it? It's like Americans want to punish it but at the same time they want to emulate it.\n\nThat's a great point. You know, there's both a revulsion and a repulsion to Blackness and an attraction to the appeal of Blackness because it has been central to the definition of what America means. From the very beginning of our sojourn on this soil, we have constantly helped to redefine what it means to be an American. Not just what it means to be Black, but what it means to be human, what it means to be a citizen of this nation. From Crispus Attucks to Louis Armstrong, from Toni Morrison to Beyoncé, the wide range and circumference of American identity expands along the borders of a questing African American identity, a questing Black identity. So for good reason, Americans are obsessed with Blackness: obsessed with containing it, controlling it, defining it, absorbing it, emulating it, and trying to put it in a box.\n\nQ: One of the things you touch on in the book is the complex nature of colorism. How has it affected you personally and shaped the Black experience overall?\n\nColorism is a deep plague in our community - a profound plague in America itself - but certainly in our own communities. My father was blue Black and from Albany, Georgia. I saw the way he was mistreated. I saw the way people looked at him as a simian - as an animal - and that was from Black people, not just the larger white society, because we've internalized some of these vicious misrepresentations of Blackness in our own community.\n\nAnd as a result of that, we have had to learn to appreciate and to embrace the beauty of our Blackness. To remind ourselves that Black is beautiful. The reason that slogan became necessary and popular is because we were living in a culture that discouraged us from embracing our inherent beauty. To contradict the assertion that Blackness, no matter how uplifting, no matter how positive, still has these elements that might potentially undercut us and undermine us.\n\nWhen it comes to colorism, I think it's important for us to constantly remind ourselves that we too have to be open-minded about the definition of Blackness.\n\nQ: When race is discussed in America, a big concept to grasp that's vital to the conversation is critical race theory. You spelled out the meaning of it in \"Entertaining Race,\" but can you talk about it in simpler terms for those who misunderstand it?\n\nLook, when you think about critical race theory, think institution, not individual. Think system and structure not sentiment and passion. Racism involves all that other stuff, but the lesson of critical race theory is that there are systemic and social barriers that prevent the flourishing of Black people in this country. The right wing ingeniously turned critical race theory against its owners and the people that they all sensibly claim to represent.\n\nBut critical race theory has done an exceptional job of having the identities of those who do such heinous things exposed and for us to think seriously about grappling with issues of inequity and going beyond what a person thinks or believes is allyship: \"I didn't say the N-word. I didn't say anything horrible.\" There are many more factors involved in being a progressive ally of Black people and understanding the tremendous tragedies and traumas we have endured.\n\nQ: Something that struck me about this book is how you discuss the way Black comedians, like Richard Pryor, Martin Lawrence, and Mo'Nique, use their comedy to make sense of the world. As an advocate for the LGBTQ community, how do you contextualize Dave Chappelle's latest performance in \"The Closer\" and the backlash he got for being perceived as transphobic?\n\nI spoke out against homophobia before it was a thing. I've been challenging the Black church on transphobia and homophobia from the very beginning, so I have deep appreciation for and sensitivity about queer identities and especially trans identities. Trans identities challenge those of us who want to remain snookered by binaries in this country.\n\nHowever, I also think it's extremely important not to censor or cancel people. If you listened to Dave Chappelle's entire comedy routine, it's far different than what people portrayed it as. He is in this comedic space yet he's raising profound questions.\n\nWhen I went to see Dave Chappelle in Nashville nearly a couple of weeks ago, he asked: \"What do you call a trans person who's Black? The N-word,\" is what he said. It echoed what Malcolm [X] said: \"What do you call a Black man with a Ph.D.? The N-word.\" Dave Chappelle, also on that special, suggested that white trans people could identify more readily with their whiteness as opposed to their trans identity. I think we have to take that into consideration.\n\nEven if we disagree, we've got to provide a space for people to engage - not punching down, not beating up - but to at least engage in an edifying and illuminating manner that allows real dialogue to take place.\n\nQ: This is one of the quotes about the complexity of art that sticks with me from \"Entertaining Race\": \"Emotional Black performance frees Black folk from a culture that harshly judges Black feeling and perception.\" Do you think that Black people will ever be free from the stereotypes that have haunted them since the inception of slavery?\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

So on one hand, we have to create the means of our own freedom, the liberation that we seek, the emancipation we desire. However, the total quality of our freedom, the ability to move without encumbrance or a hindrance is a far piece off still. So far as being totally free from them, no, but in terms of having progressive freedom and the realization of our freedom within some of these brutal barriers, I think, yes. This book is attempting to break barriers ... break down boundaries and borders and obstacles and impediments that prevent us from raising tough questions about sensitive subjects that have real consequences in the world. That's what I try to pursue in most of my work.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Specifically, she wanted to bring different people together to discuss racial reconciliation in their small town of Nolensville, Tennessee, where, like many communities across the country, tensions lurk beneath the surface and sometimes above.\n\nIt was the summer of 2020, soon after the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, and Ms. Cooke was struck by a quote circulating on social media about how staying silent on the issue of racism wasn't enough. She remembered hearing about Be the Bridge, a national Christian nonprofit that brings people together for healing conversations on race, a few years earlier. She searched for a local chapter and found none. So she asked herself: Do I have the confidence to find a co-leader and start a group?\n\nIn a town roiled by teaching about race in public schools, some people are quietly fostering reconciliation through a simple idea: sitting down and getting to know each other.\n\n\"I was honestly not wanting to be a leader; I just wanted to join,\" recalls Ms. Cooke. \"But I realized this is it; I've got to do it.\" She'd always hit it off with Ms. McAdams at school events and their daughters were friends, so she pulled up her contact list and sent a text message asking to talk.\n\nMs. McAdams, chatting between work meetings, greeted the idea with enthusiasm. \"I was like, 'Oh my gosh, wow,' this is a way to continue the conversation with people I don't know,\" says Ms. McAdams. \"I wanted to make sure it wasn't just going to be a social thing, but something I could get behind and be passionate about and would make an impact.\"\n\nMs. Cooke and Ms. McAdams still lead weekly gatherings of a group of women in Nolensville who are Black, white, and Hispanic and who want to learn about how race affects their lives and how to best treat others. They are one of a number of groups in Williamson County, Tennessee, that are trying to bridge divides between people of different backgrounds at a time of deepening rancor over race and history - particularly how the two are taught in public schools.\n\nWilliamson County, one of Tennessee's wealthiest and fastest-growing areas, has emerged, like Loudoun County, Virginia; and Southlake, Texas, as a particularly fraught site for conflict. A video showing attendees threatening speakers with chants of \"we know who you are\" and \"we will find you\" after a school board meeting last summer addressing critical race theory - and masks - garnered widespread headlines.\n\nWhile divisions within Williamson County still run deep, with nasty social media exchanges and heated education meetings, efforts persist underneath to insert a degree of respect and civility into the community's racial reckoning.\n\n\"I really believe that the way forward is together, and healing comes from loving across differences,\" says Jennifer Cortez, a mother of four who in February 2020 co-founded the group One WillCo to advocate for more racial equity and inclusion work in Williamson County Schools.\n\nBut questions linger. Are the voices of people in these groups being heard? Is their work making a difference?\n\nWilliamson County is an increasingly affluent area just south of Nashville that is suspended between the past and the future. It is dotted with Civil War sites and antebellum homes that pay homage to its rich history as part of the Old South. But it is also laced with spacious suburban homes, trendy boutiques and restaurants, and top-ranked schools that herald its emergence as a platinum appendage of encroaching Nashville.\n\nTo get here, you drive south out of the capital city on Highway 65 alongside knobs of rolling hills. The county includes six main cities and towns, of which Franklin, named after Founding Father Benjamin Franklin, is the county seat.\n\nAs you approach the county's main hub, signs designate points of interest, including a former plantation and the site of one of the bloodiest conflicts of the Civil War, the Battle of Franklin. Once in the city of 83,000, cars wind through a picturesque downtown of antique shops, galleries, and red-brick Victorian buildings.\n\nThe area is growing rapidly but is also diversifying. Though Williamson County is about 88% white, the share of \"students of color in the average white student's school\" has risen by about 10 percentage points since 1994, according to an NBC News analysis. The median household income in the county is $113,000.\n\nRace has become an increasingly discussed and debated topic here. At a roundabout in the center of Franklin, a 37-foot-high monument honoring Confederate soldiers has stood for more than 100 years. In October 2021, a statue of a U.S. Colored Troops soldier was added to the square across from the Confederate memorial. The new statue is part of a \"Fuller Story\" project started by local pastors and a historian in 2017 after the Unite the Right rally that drew hundreds of white nationalists and their supporters to Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\n\"What can we do to be proactive?\" Kevin Riggs, senior pastor at Franklin Community Church and one of the organizers  involved in the project, recalls asking. \"When something like that happens, we're always turning to pastors for healing. What can we do to be proactive so Charlottesville doesn't happen here?\"\n\nThe group raised private funds to build the statue, which it believes is the country's only U.S. Colored Troops monument in a downtown public square, and added five historical markers describing topics such as local race riots and the slave market that used to stand on the site.\n\nMr. Riggs, who is white and grew up in Nashville, doesn't recall learning much about slavery in school other than that \"it was bad and the Civil War erupted in the context of states' rights.\" He says the Fuller Story project is an effort to change the narrative so the \"Lost Cause\" myth of the Civil War - which attempts to recast the Confederate defeat in heroic terms and downplay the role of slavery - isn't prolonged and slavery isn't glossed over.\n\nLocal schools are now teaching a more accurate history of the Civil War and racism, says Mr. Riggs, who believes this development has caused a \"whitelash.\" He says it has spurred some residents to get on school boards, ban books they deem offensive, and oppose the teaching of critical race theory (CRT), when, he says, it's not actually being taught in schools. He hopes efforts such as the Fuller Story bring some unity to Franklin, with people stopping to read and take pictures of the new memorial in the heavily trafficked area.\n\nYet clashes continue to reverberate over what's being taught in public schools.\n\nIn March 2021, Robin Steenman, a former bomber pilot for the U.S. Air Force in Afghanistan and now full-time mother of three, was driving to pick up her son from preschool. She was tuned into a station that mentioned Moms for Liberty, a national advocacy group.\n\nMs. Steenman was intrigued by the organization, which was founded in January 2021 by Florida mothers wanting to champion \"liberty and parental rights\" in education. She tucked the idea away.\n\nA month later she started a Williamson County chapter, concerned that critical race theory was sneaking into local schools through curriculum changes and diversity efforts. She gathered 19 neighbors for her first meeting and quickly organized public events. In May 2021, nearly 500 people attended a \"CRT 101\" event that the chapter sponsored.\n\nMs. Steenman is upset over a public school curriculum that she says is centered \"more on feelings than on historical facts or objective truth\" and teaches students to focus too much on each other's skin color. She worries public schools are creating a society where children like hers will be a \"persecuted class,\" even though she's enrolled her own kids in private schools.\n\nWith her military training, Ms. Steenman says she is mission focused and doesn't get bogged down in dramas. To critics, her group is running a destructive campaign that's sowing division in the county.\n\nHer group filed a challenge against Williamson County Schools' new English language arts curriculum, Wit and Wisdom, and school administrators reviewed 31 texts as a result. Moms for Liberty contended the books were not age-appropriate and taught young children divisions based on race. The books included \"The Story of Ruby Bridges,\" the girl who desegregated schools in Louisiana, and \"Martin Luther King, Jr. and the March on Washington,\" which were challenged based on too many pictures of angry white people, and the way the story is told, without enough focus on progress or redemption.\n\nIn late January, Williamson County Schools released a report recommending that the district continue to use all but one of the challenged texts in the Wit and Wisdom curriculum. The report also suggested, however, that teachers adjust how they present material in seven of the books, such as skipping certain pages.\n\nSchool administrators here insist CRT is not taught in local classrooms. They point out that diversity work is necessary for the district to welcome all students, including students of color who raise instances of racism in their schools and worry that if they report them they will be ignored.\n\n\"I've got to be blunt. We're not teaching critical race theory,\" said Superintendent Jason Golden at his 2021 State of the Schools address. \"Critical race theory, as it's defined by those who are asking, is designed to make someone feel guilty, in essence as a result of their race; we're not. But what we are doing is finding ways to help all our students feel safer in their school.\"\n\nUntil last year, CRT was largely unknown in the United States. Its academic origins are traced to the 1970s when law scholars hashed out the theory, which considers the ways race and racism influence American law.\n\nThe term exploded in political and media usage in 2021 due largely to the efforts of conservative activist Christopher Rufo, who saw references to CRT scholars in anti-bias training materials and drew links in their work to Marxist scholars. He took his case against CRT to Tucker Carlson's show on Fox News, where it was viewed by then-President Donald Trump, who subsequently issued an \"anti-CRT\" executive order regarding racial bias training. Conservative news hosts increased their mention of CRT from 132 times on air in 2020 to nearly 2,000 times in the first half of 2021, according to The Washington Post.\n\nNine state legislatures, including Tennessee's, passed laws in the spring of 2021 banning schools from teaching concepts they say are found in CRT, such as that people can be inherently racist based on their race. At least 14 other states introduced or debated such laws.\n\nWhile K-12 educators across the country deny CRT is part of their lesson plans, critics charge that diversity and equity initiatives, or teaching about white privilege, exemplify CRT in action.\n\n\"We're at a moment where school leaders are trying to find ways to create a more inclusive learning environment, an environment that reflects all people and ideas, and you have a faction of our society who for better or worse tend to be loudest and most coordinated where they just label such efforts as CRT,\" says Jamel Donnor, an associate professor of education at the College of William and Mary in Virginia.\n\nFor the mothers involved in Be the Bridge, the idea wasn't to focus on CRT. But it did, inevitably, seep into their conversations.\n\nThe women, who are all working mothers ranging from their late 20s to early 50s, began to gradually gain trust in each other through their regular Zoom meetings. Starting the meetings with prayer and extending \"love and grace\" to each other helped ease difficult conversations.\n\nMs. Cooke recalls one of their early sessions when a Black group member shared how her husband was stopped by a police officer while walking their dog in town. The officer asked what he was doing there. \"I had no idea [this type of action] was happening this close to home,\" Ms. Cooke says.\n\nWhen CRT started dominating local school board meetings, members of Be the Bridge spoke at the forums in support of the district's equity work and donated multicultural books to their school library.\n\nThe group has become so tightknit that they offer each other jobs and fashion advice and text each other almost daily. Most of their families are supportive, but a few friends and family members have questioned the need for the group and suggested that talking about race will just kick up more controversy.\n\nMs. Cooke and Ms. McAdams don't give much heed to those views. Instead, they're finding themselves talking more honestly about racial issues, and not just with people in Be the Bridge.\n\n\"The conversations in this group are so meaningful, but it also makes you more comfortable having conversations with other people outside of the group,\" says Ms. McAdams, who points to a constructive conversation she had with a neighbor who is a part of Moms for Liberty about whether and how to talk to children about race in schools. Both parties walked away still friendly and understood each other better.\n\n\"In the past, I would have thought, 'I'm not going to talk about this; let's keep things easy,' but tough conversations need to be had,\" she says.\n\nOther community groups are also trying to bring people together around what they see as often overlooked acts of discrimination. Revida Rahman, an executive from Brentwood, Tennessee, and mother of two sons enrolled in Williamson County Schools, contacted the district about five years ago with her husband and other Black families. They were concerned that field trips to a plantation didn't fully address slavery. They said their children were also called racial slurs by classmates. The district formed a Cultural Competency Council, ran anti-bias training for staff, and hired a diversity consultant.\n\nIn late 2019, Ms. Cortez, who is white, contacted Ms. Rahman to see if they could work together to foster more understanding about why diversity efforts are needed. They wanted their group, One WillCo, to encourage a more civil tone in discussions between school leaders and parents in particular.\n\n\"We're trying to have a different approach, a sense of calm, civility, respect, to communicate with others who disagree with us and have some productivity instead of yelling or being upset with those who disagree,\" says Ms. Rahman.\n\nHarmony Kennedy, a 10th grade student at Nolensville High School, who is Black, spoke in a One WillCo social media video about incidents she's faced in school, such as when a classmate called her his slave after asking her to pick up his trash.\n\n\"I think they need to educate the teachers and the students as well on the remarks they make, and teach teachers how to handle the situations that happen,\" says Harmony in an interview.\n\nMs. Cortez and Ms. Rahman are disappointed with division in the community around CRT, which they think has become politicized. Ms. Cortez planned to meet with Ms. Steenman of Moms for Liberty, but it fell through over COVID-19 concerns.\n\nOther community members have formed relationships with Ms. Steenman even when they disagree with her. Lamont Turner grew up in Franklin, the only Black male student in his class at a private high school and a football star. Looking back, he sees how steeped in Southern Civil War culture he was, celebrating sports championships at the Confederate monument and whistling \"Dixie.\"\n\nIt wasn't until more recently when his wife asked if he wanted to take a family photo in front of the monument that he started asking deeper questions about what it stands for. Mr. Turner started a blog and was invited by civic groups to talk about the need to understand how historical wrongs still bear on the present.\n\n\"That's the only way we can truly heal. From any angle that you try to look at this, the truth is the actual healing nutrient that will help us go to where we want to go,\" he says.\n\nMr. Turner and Ms. Steenman became acquainted after they participated in a community forum run by the diversity consultant hired by Williamson County Schools. Ms. Steenman asked to meet up.\n\nMr. Turner agreed to talk, and they started exchanging pictures of their families. Deep down, each person hopes the other will start to change their point of view, but they also enjoy building a friendship.\n\n\"I enjoy those meetings because I don't need an echo chamber,\" says Ms. Steenman. \"The best possible outcome is you convince him to come over to your way of thinking, but if we're somewhere in the middle, that's still a great thing.\"\n\n\"I have to meet Robin and my community where they are at,\" says Mr. Turner. \"That's my intent when I engage with all sides. I try to lead with education, and in an educational spirit, I can't go into a conversation thinking I know it all.\"\n\nThe civility of some of these one-on-one encounters may be severely tested in the future. In what's expected to add fuel to the CRT debate, Tennessee lawmakers recently passed a bill allowing partisan school board elections for the first time.\n\nBoth the Democratic and Republican parties in Williamson County announced they will field candidates for August 2022 elections - and no doubt the volume on issues surrounding race will rise.\n\n\"I think we'll see more instances of this deep contention around CRT as we head into 2022 and the midterm election year,\" says Ebony Duncan-Shippy, an assistant professor of education at Washington University in St. Louis. \"The only way we can move beyond that is if all of the groups, all folks at the table see it in their best interest to do so.\"\n\nMs. Cooke and Ms. McAdams have already added a shock-absorber depth to their relationship. Running Be the Bridge has moved them from being mothers who had a connection through their children at day care to becoming close friends. They're open and honest with each other. They're hoping to start other Be the Bridge chapters in the area. \"I wish everyone could be a part of a group like this because it's life-changing,\" says Ms. Cooke while sipping coffee at Itty Bitty Donuts & Specialty Coffee in Nolensville.\n\nBefore getting up to head back to work, Ms. McAdams smiles and agrees. \"We're learning from each other. She's learning from me; I'm learning from her. Our experiences may be different, but the more we talk the more I get that, I can see where you're coming from,\" says Ms. McAdams.\n\n* This story has been updated to include the Williamson County Schools' recommendations about the books used in the district's new English language arts curriculum.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

That's become a contentious question for communities as more schools have incorporated into curriculum the idea that residual racism continues to shape modern America. In many states, the debate has shifted from schools to legislatures, as education writer Chelsea Sheasley explored earlier this month .\n\nBoth sides bring distinct worldviews to the discussion, and even defining terms such as \"systemic racism\" has become a stumbling block.\n\nFor Andrew Gutmann, a New York parent, \"Systemic racism, properly understood, is segregated schools and separate lunch counters,\" he wrote in a letter to parents at the elite Brearley School that was later published online by former New York Times columnist Bari Weiss. \"We have not had systemic racism against Blacks in this country since the civil rights reforms of the 1960s,\" he added.\n\nTherein lies the rub for Americans on both sides of the debate. While white conservatives acknowledge the historical examples Mr. Gutmann listed, they prefer to focus on the progress made and chafe at the notion that systemic or institutional racism undergirds American institutions today. To them, the words systemic and institutional imply an overt and intentional effort to enact policies that discriminate based on race.\n\nBut to Boston-area teacher Jo Persad, systemic racism is \"this ever-present force, kind of like gravity. You can't see it but you can experience its effects,\" she told \"Today.\" \"It 'holds' the world together.\"\n\nFrom this vantage point, racism remains systemic, despite the abolition of overtly racist policies. Redlining practices relegating people of color to less desirable neighborhoods, for instance, have largely been repealed. But a 2018 study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition found that 74% of redlined communities of the 1930s remain low-to-moderate income today. \"It's as if some of these places have been trapped in the past, locking neighborhoods into concentrated poverty,\" Jason Richardson of NCRC told The Washington Post.\n\nIronically, most everyone would agree that opportunity is a right, regardless of race. For many conservatives, however, erasing discriminatory laws leveled the playing field enough that progress becomes a matter of individual agency. The other camp cares deeply about agency, too. But for them, the ongoing impact of those laws has stymied advancement uniformly enough that the lack of progress must be addressed as a systemic problem, not individuals' failure.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

In the style of the classic teenage pastime \"never have I ever,\" she posed statements to her class for discussion. One prompt, \"never have I ever been scared of the cops,\" resulted in students sharing times when they had felt afraid of the police.\n\n\"That opened the door to talk about it, to talk about Daunte Wright, about protests and riots and the National Guard being on their streets,\" says Ms. Muhammad, an English teacher at Patrick Henry High School in Minneapolis. \"I try to open the window and crack the door and make space for whoever needs to talk about it.\"\n\nIncorporating current events into her classroom - and digging deeper to address topics like power, bias, and racism - is something Ms. Muhammad believes is essential in order to connect with her students and help them succeed.\n\nThe murder of George Floyd jolted many educators to prioritize teaching about structural racism and social justice - and resulted in pushback over student \"indoctrination.\" What can be learned from Minneapolis, a microcosm of the national debate on addressing race in schools?\n\n\"It recognizes their humanity, it builds community, it builds healing, it allows students to feel seen and allows teachers to learn about what's going on in their lives,\" says Ms. Muhammad , who teaches in a red brick high school surrounded by homes peppered recently with lawn signs reading \"Justice for George Floyd\" and \"Guns Down, Love Up.\"\n\nFor Ms. Muhammad , who describes herself as a social justice-minded teacher, covering these topics comes naturally, and she's encouraging her colleagues to move toward a more inclusive curriculum. Some other teachers are uncomfortable or don't see the purpose. As educators across the country wrestle with addressing the nation's racial reckoning in their classrooms, what's happening in Minneapolis offers a microcosm of the struggles and lessons learned since the death of Mr. Floyd here nearly a year ago. It has played out in the district in the form of teacher training, more space in some cases for in-class discussion, and, in the Twin Cities region overall, an increase in courses focused on the study of race.\n\n\"These kind of courses have been asked for and rolled out in various forms over the last 15 to 20 years, but you see a higher prioritization, you see more school board members talking about it, you see principals being more open in terms of expressing their desire and creating courses that didn't exist last year,\" says Brian Lozenski, an associate professor of urban and multicultural education at Macalester College in St. Paul.\n\nThis echoes a larger debate in the United States about what should be taught in classes - Historic examples of racism? How identity relates to racism? Basic ethnic studies? - and how to create safe environments for such discussions. Addressing journalists this week, Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said he doesn't believe the Department of Education should tell local districts what to teach, but he added, \"[W]hen students are seen in the curriculum, when they are felt, like their stories are listened to or heard, they are more likely to engage and want to be there.\"\n\nMoves to create more inclusive schools for students of color, both in Minneapolis and nationally, have garnered support but also stirred up concerns. Critical race theory, an academic framework that considers how policies and laws perpetuate racism, has emerged as an especially contentious flash point, particularly in conservative circles.\n\nIn Idaho, the governor signed a bill on April 28 which states that ideas often found in critical race theory \"undermine\" the goals of dignity and nondiscrimination in public education. Since April 27, legislators in Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana have also passed or debated measures related to limiting critical race theory in schools or state agencies. Elsewhere, a school board election in Southlake, Texas, drew an unusually large turnout on May 2, with voters defeating candidates who supported a district plan to make curriculum and disciplinary changes to promote racial and cultural tolerance.\n\nIn Minneapolis, there's momentum from education leaders to build teachers' skills at addressing racial justice in their classes, both by providing space for informal discussion and with guidance on what should be taught. Minneapolis Public Schools is updating its \"climate framework\" to create a more welcoming and inclusive culture, is revising its literacy curriculum, and will require an ethnic studies class for graduation starting with the class of 2025. The district did not return requests for comment on how effective these measures have been.\n\nMore broadly, in the past year, a handful of school districts in the Twin Cities region have created courses focused on the study of race, says Professor Lozenski. At the state level, the Minnesota Department of Education is reviewing social studies standards, the first draft of which places greater emphasis on the history and culture of historically marginalized groups.\n\nThese ideas have been met with some pushback. Katherine Kersten, a senior policy fellow at Center of the American Experiment, a think tank based in Golden Valley, Minnesota, recently criticized the state's social studies curriculum review, charging that if the draft is approved, \"the next generation of Minnesota citizens will not only be uninformed - but scandalously misinformed - about our state's and nation's history and democratic institutions. They will, however, be programmed to become the next generation of 'woke' social activists.\"\n\nBy contrast, Professor Lozenski says that creating a more diverse curriculum benefits all students. \"Even now, African Americans are often looked at as just being victims of incredible racism, and that's all people can say about [them],\" he says. \"It completely ignores the intellectual histories, the artistic exchanges, the mathematics, and the science that [have] been engaged with in these communities.\"\n\nSonia Svedahl, a senior at Washburn High School in Minneapolis, advocated for an ethnic studies graduation requirement after realizing that she hadn't learned about her heritage in school. Her mother and grandparents are from India. She says her teachers address current events, but mostly on big news days, and she wishes there was more time for in-depth conversations, through both student-led forums and the course curriculum.\n\n\"I don't blame my teachers because I think everyone doesn't know what their role in the process is. It's confusing, you don't want to do the wrong thing,\" she says. She and her friends have led voluntary student discussions at lunch and after school on race-based topics, but they find it hard to draw big groups due to remote learning and the recent transition to in-person classes.\n\nMinneapolis Public Schools started the school year with an all-staff, virtual professional development session about anti-racist education by Dr. Bettina Love, a professor at the University of Georgia and co-founder of the Abolitionist Teaching Network. Nearby districts also offer equity training, but professional development can only go so far, says Lee-Ann Stephens, a former Minnesota teacher of the year who works in the St. Louis Park school district, a suburb adjacent to Minneapolis.\n\n\"We offer training quite a bit, especially about creating conversations about race protocols ... but I think it also has to be something that gets internalized and is important. Particularly with race, it's not normed, it gets uncomfortable because no one wants to offend or say the wrong thing, but students just want us to open a space for them,\" says Dr. Stephens.\n\nStatewide, only 4% of teachers in Minnesota identify as teachers of color or American Indian, while 34% of the student population does, according to the Minnesota Department of Education.\n\nSamantha Pree-Stinson, a Minneapolis resident and mom of three sons, says Black students in her neighborhood are \"ill equipped to talk about what they're experiencing\" in their personal lives while at school, \"and teachers are ill equipped to talk about it.\" She advocates for a more diverse workforce and better teacher training, because she believes most teachers \"want to be culturally competent.\"\n\nBack at Patrick Henry High School, where Ms. Muhammad teaches, a few students linger after school recently, chatting or walking to the baseball fields for practice. One tenth grade student, standing outside with a friend, says she doesn't like to talk about current events in her classes. \"It's sad to talk about. It's sad that it keeps happening,\" she says, referring to police shootings of Black men.\n\nMs. Muhammad recognizes that not all of her students want to discuss topics like police shootings or protests in school, and she knows her students need a space to feel joyful. She seeks to provide joy through her classroom environment and with lessons that show the strengths and successes of various racial and ethnic groups. She follows her students' lead on whether or how much they want to discuss social injustices in the news.\n\n\"I believe joy is healing. In our classrooms, especially in north Minneapolis, our kids deserve to be in that healing process,\" she says. \"Whether covert or overt, I think joy is healing to the students and it creates resiliency in them so they can keep pushing even amid all this craziness.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "The Conversation About Critical Race Theory In Schools Is Over.\n\nBy Peter Greene\n\nBy Peter Greene ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nWhat are you saying?\n\nGranted, the term is still being bandied around, but at this point it is meaningless, a placeholder for various grievances. As is too often in the case of education, we are not really talking about what we're really talking about.\n\nFolks on the left who insist that Critical Race Theory is not taught in K-12 schools, or who keep posting accurate definitions of CRT are missing the point (either deliberately or innocently). It's true that the vast majority of people throwing the term around don't know what it means. Parents are upset about something; telling them they're using the wrong name for it doesn't really further the conversation.\n\nNor is it useful to argue that the anti-whatever-it-is movement is fake. Like the Tea Party movement before it, it is fueled by plenty of political expertise and opaque funding, but as the failed \"Joe Biden is a dangerous raving socialist\" showed, if your political New Coke doesn't resonate, it will just flop quietly. Leading anti-wii groups like Moms for Liberty and Parents Defending Education are operated by professional communications folks and seasoned political operatives, but that doesn't mean they haven't activated and harnessed actual anger and upset among people on the ground.\n\nWhile the movement is not exactly fake, it's not exactly real, either. Conservatives who argue that this is just a grass roots groundswell are ignoring the deliberate moves made to ramp up this controversy, most notably by Christopher Rufo who stumbled upon CRT and created a movement that came, in his own words, \"from nothing,\" and then months later proudly declared, in an oft-quoted tweet :\n\nWe have successfully frozen their brand - 'critical race theory' - into the public conversation and are steadily driving up negative perceptions. We will eventually turn it toxic, as we put all of the various cultural insanities under that brand category.\n\nNot so much astro-turf as astro-gasoline. Rufo and friends could not have pulled off this trick if there had not been some real sparks of dissatisfaction among some parents. The \"CRT isn't taught in K-12\" folks are skipping over the ways that CRT has informed programs and materials and teacher training. But at the same time the Anti crowd has broadened their concerns to range far beyond anything related to Critical Race Theory. LGBTQ+ issues, opposition to social and emotional learning, and calls for removing books for a broad range of reasons have become part of the landscape, along with an assortment of state and local rules that are so broad and misdirected that in some cases they would arguably ban lots of things- but not critical race theory . When you read about an Ohio district forbidding rainbows in classrooms (we're in a \"politically charged era\") or a Florida administrator telling teachers they must have classroom books that show the \"other side\" of the Holocaust , you're seeing districts trying to avoid crossing lines that have been vaguely, broadly, and badly drawn. Turns out if you don't really what CRT is other than \"all the bad things,\" you can find it anywhere.\n\nThis sort of wide-ranging educational backlash is not new. A century ago, some states outlawed the teaching of evolution. Education historians trace outbreaks of outrage throughout the 20th century, including revolts against \"unpatriotic\" texts. Values clarification and outcome based education were more recent versions of the same outrage. Alabama's anti-CRT law is actually an amendment to their earlier rules forbidding teachers to use yoga, meditation or hypnosis in the classroom. Anti-wii rules are being followed in many states by demands for greater transparency from schools; post every lesson, every text, every piece of instructional material where parents may see (and object) to it.\n\nWe're not talking about Critical Race Theory any more. The conversation appears to be, mostly about parents and values and distrust of the school. This is, as noted above, not new. It's a scary thing to entrust your child to the care of someone who may or may not share your own values. It cannot help that today's parents have grown up in an era of bipartisan insistence that public schools are fading. And while such protests are not new, one must wonder if they are greater now than when 1950s parents feared Red-ucators in the classroom , or if amplification by social media and the Fox news megaphone is making it seem greater.\n\nHaving a conversation about parental values and control is a lot harder than bashing back and forth over CRT. Parents are, after all, not the only stakeholders in public education (to argue that they are is to argue that only parents should pay school taxes). And some of the values being argued for are not necessarily worth embracing in school or society. When the head of Tennessee's chapter of Mom's for Liberty argued against Ruby Bridges' account of her experience as one of the first Black children to integrate a New Orleans school, her complaint was that\n\nthe mention of a \"large crowd of angry white people who didn't want Black children in a white school\" too harshly delineated between Black and white people, and that the book didn't offer \"redemption\" at its end.\n\nThe same leader has also made the argument that children should not see the photo of Black children being fire hosed at the March on Washington, because it might affect how children feel about policemen. \"I don't want them to see racism yet,\" she explained, speaking of second graders, despite the fact that a Black second grader probably already knows about racism.\n\nIt's hard to view that as anything other than a plea to preserve white fragility over historical accuracy. The new Johnston County (NC) policy that teachers must present the founding fathers as \"reformists, innovators and heroes\" is certainly about something other than CRT. The continued battles in Southlake , an affluent community near Dallas, seem much more related to a battle over whether or not to address racism in the district. That's not unusual; an NBC analysis found that many \"CRT\" battles are located in school districts where the white population is losing its majority status. Some \"CRT\" debates carry echoes of white nationalist replacement theory ; the term \"Critical Race Theory\" is being used by some as way to avoid saying \"I don't like all this Black stuff the school is doing.\"\n\nMeanwhile, there is a missing conversation centered around legitimate concerns about the structure and management of local district diversity initiatives. I've received complaints of requirements for \"catechism-like\" recitations from students, and of districts simply implementing programs-in-a-box. Programs dealing with students' beliefs and values must be implemented with care and communication, and some districts are far more skilled at that than others; but in the current climate, as one parent put it, \"any sane parent taking issue with some of this stuff is labeled a right-wing nut job.\"\n\nAnd it does not help that everyone involved in all of these conversations is working from anecdotes, not actual collected state or national level data.\n\nThe debate is going to continue, if for no other reason that some GOP candidates will see the Virginia governor's race as a sign that beating this particular drum wins elections. But it's not a debate about Critical Race Theory. It's a debate about parents' roles in school, about trusting teachers and schools, about school's role in society, about how to deal with race and racism (or how not to deal), about how schools can best support all their students (or not), about which books to put in libraries, about how to bring children up to be their best selves, and, unfortunately, about how to use fear and anger to drive clicks, views, and votes. It would be helpful for all of these important discussions if we talked about what we're actually talking about instead of continuing to throw around a term that has been, for the general public, emptied of all real meaning."

      "text": "A Straightforward Primer On Critical Race Theory (and Why It Matters)\n\nBy Ilana Redstone\n\nBy Ilana Redstone ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nRacism - social issues and concepts word cloud illustration. Word collage concept.\n\nDebates over how to talk and think about race, racism, and identity are happening in schools, in the workplace, and in our broader discourse. Much of the current discussion is linked to ideas around critical race theory (CRT), a once obscure social science perspective that burst through to the mainstream in ways that have been surprising to many. In recent weeks, both The Washington Post and The New York Times have devoted considerable space to the topic (see here and here for examples). However, most of what's been written in these outlets has failed to paint a full picture.\n\nCRT's critics are often portrayed as wanting to \"whitewash\" history and deny the reality of slavery. If the problem were that simple, the criticisms would indeed be worthy of the dismissal they often receive. Yet, there are serious concerns about CRT that are rarely aired and that have nothing to do with these points. As a result, confusion and misinformation abound and tension continues to mount.\n\nBefore making a few clarifying points, it's worth noting that the vast majority of teachers and DEI trainers are not sitting down with students or groups announcing a lesson on CRT. More often than not, the name \"CRT\" never comes up at all. However, a CRT-based perspective is quietly shaping the conversation anyway. Its impact can be seen in conversations about race, power, identity, intent, privilege, and in an insistence on seeing the world through its lens.\n\nSo what is it?\n\nCRT is a theoretical perspective that asserts that race is always about inequality and domination. CRT has a few main tenets, some of which can be (over)simplified as follows:\n\n1. Colorblind racism-Deemphasizing the role of race and racism, including to focus on concepts of merit, is itself a manifestation of racism.\n\n2. Interest convergence-Members of the dominant group will only support equality when it's in their best interest to do so.\n\n3. Race and racism are always tied together. Race is a construct meant to preserve white dominance over people of color, while making it seem like life is about meritocracy.\n\n4. Inattention to systemic racism-An unwillingness to recognize the full force of systemic racism as determining disparities between groups is a denial of the reality of racism today (and evidence of ignorance at best and racism at worst).\n\nThese tenets have far-reaching implications. For instance, through this lens, questioning the extent of the role of systemic racism in shaping disparities between groups is itself considered evidence of racism, either overt or internalized. The suggestion that such a question might not be tied to racial animus of any kind is dismissed as either the result of ignorance or of more internalized racism. So, while rightly shining a light on racism as a problem, CRT leaves no space for non-racist reasons to see the world-or, in this case, the causes of inequality-differently.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in engaging on these topics is that-returning to our example for the moment-when it comes to questioning the extent of the role of systemic racism in generating inequality, racism *is* often one possible explanation. The question then becomes: What do we do when we can't know for sure what someone's motivation is? The answer to that key question is determined by yet another one: What kind of society do we want to build? Welcoming a diversity of perspectives, fostering open communication, broadening discourse, and even democracy itself, are all incompatible with having a default assumption of racism or ignorance when it comes to some of our most difficult social problems.\n\nSo what's the path forward? Here are a few suggestions:\n\nTo conservatives : Stop trying to enact legislative bans on CRT. Such bans are censorious, probably unconstitutional, and, simply put, will do nothing to solve the underlying problem.\n\nTo progressives : Stop talking about CRT and, more importantly, its related ideas as though objections to it and concerns about it are all driven by a denial of systemic racism or an unwillingness to acknowledge the reality of slavery. As I've pointed out here, this is to grossly miss the point. The importance of this point stands even if the loudest critics are not raising the concerns I've outlined here.\n\nTo the mainstream media : See advice for progressives, above.\n\nTo schools and workplaces : Critical Race Theory is a social science theory-a tool to understand the world around us. As a theory, its related ideas about race, identity, power, and fairness constitute one possible way to see the world. As with any social science theory, but particularly one this controversial, its ideas should be placed in context. Placing the ideas in context requires presenting contrasting viewpoints-for instance, perspectives that do not automatically assert that racialized explanations and solutions should be the primary lens for viewing the world. Importantly, these contrasting viewpoints are to be presented on moral footing that's equal to CRT's.\n\nThe upshot is this: The problem is that CRT and its related ideas form a closed system. It's a perspective that leaves no space for anyone, no matter how well-intentioned, to see the world differently. When presented as the singular valid worldview, it isn't a productive way to engage with students, groups, or with one another.\n\nHere's the good news: There's a better way. There are ways to integrate multiple ideological perspectives into classrooms and the workplace. But they will require a willingness to relax the assumptions that underpin CRT.\n\nNote: The tenets as described above are paraphrased from sociology faculty who favor this particular way of seeing the world."

      "text": "Your Company's DEI Training Isn't Critical Race Theory, No Need To Ban It\n\nBy Shaun Harper\n\nBy Shaun Harper ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nSpeaker talking in seminar with many of audiences for business meeting for key of success\n\nCritical Race Theory (CRT) has been popularized and destructively misunderstood over the past two years. But first, what is it?\n\nCRT is an academically credible set of analytic tools legal scholars created more than four decades ago to help judges, attorneys, expert witnesses, law students, and others in the Courts understand the role of race in the determination of judicial outcomes.\n\nScholars and legal practitioners who use CRT acknowledge the persistence and pervasiveness of racism in America; challenge claims of objectivity, colorblindness, and universal meritocracy; insist on full, accurate teachings of historical facts pertaining to race; and situate people of color as experts on our own experiences with racial injustice.\n\nKimberlé Williams Crenshaw, an acclaimed law professor at both UCLA and Columbia University, made a significant contribution to CRT in the late 1980s by introducing \"intersectionality\" as a prism through which to understand how the convergence of racism, sexism, poverty, religious discrimination, homophobia, transphobia, and other social forces place Black women at particular vulnerability for the miscarriage of justice in the law. I will explain later why I specifically called out intersectionality from among the many tenets, propositions, and theses that comprise CRT.\n\nThe major takeaway is that CRT was created by legal scholars - mostly academicians of color - for the legal profession. It has since been imported into the social sciences and other academic fields. Noteworthy is that few of our nation's law schools offer CRT courses. In fact, most students will complete three years of law school without reading anything about CRT.\n\nI have taught a graduate-level CRT course at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Southern California annually over the past 13 years. My students, like most who are introduced to CRT at higher education institutions, are master's and doctoral degree seekers, not undergraduates - and certainly not third graders.\n\nCRT became a political grenade in the 2021 Virginia Governor's race , as Republican Glenn Youngkin ran fear-mongering television commercials warning voters that Governor Terry McAuliffe, the Democrat incumbent, wanted to teach their children CRT in schools. Despite being untrue, it worked. Many uninformed voters said it was the most important issue in the race, yet few of those opponents could articulate a definition of CRT . The ridiculousness didn't end in the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n\nEducation Week reports that 42 states have pending or fully-enacted bans on the teaching of CRT in K-12 schools. The biggest problem with this is that there's practically no evidence that CRT is being taught to our nation's schoolchildren. I have publicly and repeatedly called for someone, anyone to produce a confirmable list of 50 educators who are teaching CRT in elementary, middle, or high schools across America. No one has furnished any such list. Why? Because there aren't 50.\n\nSo, why then is a thing that's not happening been banned in such a rapid, widespread fashion? There are so many absurd explanations. I'll offer just three here.\n\nThe murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery and the corresponding social unrest that ensued in summer 2020 forced a long overdue national conversation about structural and systemic racism. That racial reckoning not only occurred on the streets of America and in workplaces, but also in schools. There was a call to finally teach the full truth about our nation's racial past and present. A lot of miseducated people who had only been taught a one-sided, sanitized version of U.S. history had a violent reaction to this that they took out on CRT.\n\nThat opponents outlawed something they hadn't read is a second explanation for the CRT bans. \"Tell me specifically which CRT writers you have read, and which articles of theirs informed your oppositional stance,\" is a pair of questions I have posed to critics. They almost always fumble and ultimately fail to name specific scholars and pieces they've read. Or they name papers that have little to no CRT in them. Policymakers banning something they haven't read is indisputably reckless.\n\nA third explanation is the one that extends from education into business. CRT opponents typically conflate anything and everything pertaining to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) with CRT. They're not the same.\n\nBans on the teaching of something not being taught in schools followed a September 2020 memo from the Trump Administration that instructed every federal agency \"to identify all contracts or other agency spending related to any training on critical race theory, white privilege or any other training or propaganda effort that teaches or suggests either (1) that the United States is an inherently racist or evil country or (2) that any race or ethnicity is inherently racist or evil.\"\n\nThe White House memo noted that \"according to press reports\" these ideals were being taught to government employees - neither specific media sources nor any other evidence that this was happening in any widespread fashion were furnished. Notwithstanding, federal agencies as well as public schools and universities across the country swiftly halted trainings on race specifically, and in some instances, DEI more broadly.\n\nIncreasingly, businesses are either creating or expanding DEI education for employees. Much of it is broadly focused on topics like implicit bias, ableism, gender discrimination, and heterosexism, to name a few topics. Occasionally, workshops focus specifically on race, racism, and racial equity. Their emphasis on race don't automatically make those trainings CRT.\n\nIn many companies, teaching about intersectionality is on trend to help employees better understand how queer women of color or employees of color with disabilities, for example, uniquely experience their workplace settings because of the convergence of their multiple marginalized identities. While developed by a CRT expert, the manner in which intersectionality is taught in corporate trainings is a far departure from the complexity and criticality that Professor Crenshaw intended. Most intersectionality sessions are 'CRT light' at best, but really not even.\n\nChief diversity officers, HR professionals, consultants, and others who design and deliver DEI learning experiences to business professionals aren't teaching complex academic concepts that legal scholars developed in the 1970s. Surely, employees would find such trainings too inaccessibly academic and insufficiently focused on solving practical business problems. It isn't happening.\n\nLeaders really need not worry at all about CRT making its way into their companies, government agencies, and other workplace settings. As is the case in K-12 schools, there won't be anywhere near 50 people teaching CRT to American workers. DEI or racial equity trainings based explicitly on Critical Race Theory are too rare to warrant senseless corporate bans."

Ron DeSantis has successfully pushed for a new rule banning Critical Race Theory from ... More the classroom.  (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nIn 2021, Republican legislators in nearly half of all states have introduced bills to regulate how schools teach about race. Florida recently joined the ranks of states that explicitly ban teaching Critical Race Theory (\"CRT\") in the classroom. The new rule ban s \"theories that distort historical events and are inconsistent with State Board approved standards including the denial or minimization of the Holocaust, and the teaching of Critical Race Theory . . .\". The rule also bans use of the New York Times ' 1619 Project, which argues that America's real founding date was the day the first slave ship arrived.\n\nWill these laws improve children's education? That depends on a lot of questions. What exactly is CRT? What specifically are states like Florida trying to prevent? Are these laws well-drafted or are they vague and too broad?\n\nThere are many different laws and bills out there and they vary widely in content. Since Florida is a large swing state and its governor, Ron DeSantis, is an early frontrunner for the Republican nomination for President, this post will focus on Florida's CRT ban. CRT means different things to different people, but Florida has defined it as \"the theory that racism is not merely the product of prejudice, but that racism is embedded in American society and its legal systems in order to uphold the supremacy of white persons.\"\n\nThis is closely tied the idea of \"structural racism.\" At its most modest and straightforward, it is the idea that minorities, especially Black people, suffer from racism even when they aren't being currently victimized by racially prejudiced people. For example, if Black renters couldn't get a home loan in 1940, that means that today fewer Black people own homes and that when they do own homes they are worth less on the market. Structural racism also means that seemingly neutral laws, such as single family zoning, keep Black people out of white neighborhoods because such zoning laws make it too expensive for them to move into an area.\n\nSo far, so good. It's educational for students to learn how some seemingly neutral laws have racist origins and continue to perpetuate racial inequality today. When CRT is criticized, its defenders often defend this version of CRT. But CRT advocates often go well beyond this. For example, some school districts encourage the formation of racially-segregated affinity groups in which \"white people can discover together their group identity. They can cultivate racial solidarity and compassion and support each other in sitting with the discomfort, confusion, and numbness that often accompany white racial awakening.\"\n\nThere are good reasons for states to push back against programs that encourage white \"racial solidarity\" or that encourage a sense of collective racial guilt. Because structural racism holds that all white people benefit from current racist laws and structures, it is somethings used to argue that all white people are individually racist. Parents are understandably upset when their children come home from school feeling negatively about the color of their skin .\n\nThe new Florida rule focuses on another excess of Critical Race Theory: the idea that America was founded on the principle of racism and is a fundamentally racist country. As the distinguished law professor Daniel Farber has put it (in the context of refuting it): \"racism is part of the DNA of the American legal system, a sort of genetic flaw. I think that really is a fair statement of the heart of critical race theory.\"\n\nIt is perfectly appropriate for states to push back against this sort of excess. It is the job of state and local government to determine what values the public education system strives to instill in its students. Just as it would be appropriate for the state to forbid public schools from teaching that slavery was a positive institution, it can forbid schools from teaching that slavery was the defining characteristic of America's founding.\n\nAnother question is whether these laws are the best ways to achieve that goal. A lot of the anti-CRT laws are badly drafted. A number of them, for example, forbid teachers from making students feel \"discomfort, guilt, anguish or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race or sex.\" Pegging the law to a student's subjective feelings is asking for trouble. Of course learning about the horrors of slavery might make some white students feel discomfort or guilt. This is what leads some defenders of CRT to claim that these laws will make it difficult to teach students about important, historical facts regarding race in America. It would be far better for states to mandate, as North Carolina does, that students should not be taught that \"An individual, solely by virtue of his or her race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex.\"\n\nWhat about Florida's rule, which bans teaching that America's laws, including the Constitution, are inherently racist and forbids using the 1619 Project as educational material? The law is certainly within the constitutional power of the state. Courts have held that government has the constitutional power to control curricular issues and decide on teaching materials without violating the First Amendment.\n\nIdeally, rather than forbidding any teaching of CRT, the law would require that a diversity of viewpoints on race be taught. Students could learn a lot from a truly rigorous conversation about whether the police use disproportionate force against minorities or whether the economic status of minorities is improving. CRT is an important critique of America regardless of whether one agrees with it. Surely there are ways for the states to reign in the excesses of CRT without banning the teaching of it altogether."

More 1961. (Photo by William Lovelace/Daily/Express/Hulton Archive/Getty Images)\n\nPoliticians, talk show hosts, news commentators, and scholars are all talking about Critical Race Theory (CRT). In 16 states , legislation has been introduced or passed that bans the use of CRT in classrooms at the K-12 and college levels, and in diversity trainings, within the public sphere. Why all the commotion and is it merited?\n\nThe average person had no idea what CRT is, and until recently, when a few conservative thinkers and former president Donald Trump uttered the phrase, most politicians didn't know what it was either.\n\nMany opponents of CRT gather information on colleges and universities that employ its tenets in their classrooms and trainings by visiting a website called CriticalRace.org . The site is owned by the Legal Insurrection Foundation , a conservative nonprofit established by Cornell law school professor William A. Jacobson in 2008. CriticalRace.org refers to CRT as a \"radical ideology that focuses on race as the key to understanding society.\" It also says: \"critical race theorists challenge the very foundations of the liberal order, such as rationalism, constitutional law, and legal reasoning.\" In addition, the site has information on K-12 schools.\n\nThe site's information on higher education includes institutions in every state and it purports to document a range of functions where those institutions use CRT. Among them: the appointment of senior level administrators focused on equity, presidential statements on racism, classes on CRT, anti-racist trainings, the establishment of programs and centers related to race, and the hiring of faculty who use CRT and anti-racist theories in their research.\n\nCritical race theorists don't dispute the idea that understanding the impact of race is essential for understanding society. They see recognizing and understanding the impact of racism as essential for understanding the history and current context of America. According to a June 9 tweet by New York Times correspondent and creator of \"The 1619 Project\" Nikole Hannah-Jones, \"CRT is not radical if you actually know what it is. The [idea] that race is embedded in the law and our nation's institutions is simply historical fact.\" In the words of longtime CRT legal scholars and authors of the book Critical Race Theory: An Introduction , Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic: \" Unlike traditional approaches to civil rights, which stress incrementalism and step-by-step progress, critical race theory questions the very foundations of the liberal order, including equality theory, legal reasoning, Enlightenment rationalism, and neutral principles of constitutional law .\" The critics of CRT agree with Delgado and Stefancic's definition; they just don't think it's a good idea to question the foundations of our nation.\n\nThe issue, and thus the commotion, is not the definition of CRT. Instead, the issue at hand is whether and how CRT is taught (or used in trainings) in public institutions. Within colleges and universities, free speech and academic freedom are considered essential to learning and are the foundation for new ideas and exploration. When taught in college classrooms, according to Delgado, CRT helps learners understand more about their social world and be better citizens. He says that \"they will emerge with a better understanding of the social currents that swirl around them and feel more at ease with people of different races and ethnicities.\"\n\nLikewise, Kimberlé Crenshaw, Columbia University law professor and one of the founders of CRT, describes CRT as saying to people, including students, \"Let's pay attention to what has happened in this country, and how what is happening in this country is continuing to create differential outcomes so we can become that country that we say we are.\" She also considers the theory and corresponding movement \"patriotic\" because CRT scholars \"believe in the promises of equality.\"\n\nProtesters against police violence and racism continue to rally at the Richmond, VA monument to ... More Confederate General Robert E. Lee on June 18, 2020. They're using the monument as a screen to feature the names and faces of those killed by police and historically important black leaders. (Photo by Zach D Roberts/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nIn effect, those who use, teach, and support CRT consider it essential to question our foundations as a nation and to grapple with the treatment of our citizens. From Indiana University law professor Kevin Brown's perspective, we are \"trying to understand\" why \"Americans seem to ignore the massive socio-economic differences that exist among racial groups, even though all Americans [know] or should [know] that these [are] legacies of our history of racial oppression.\" Those who oppose CRT see the questioning of our foundations as anti-American and caution students to be leery of this kind of education in the classroom."

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nAs we head toward this weekend's 245th anniversary of American independence, critical race theory has emerged as the dominant subject gripping and dividing the nation. The threshold question, itself the subject of rancorous and oftentimes disingenuous debate, is what the term \"critical race theory\" (CRT) even refers to. When this semantic debate surfaces, proponents usually attempt two things at once.\n\nFirst, they accuse their CRT-skeptical interlocutors of being bigots, white supremacists or apologists who want to deliberately muddle and whitewash America's complex-and at times tragic-history of race relations. This first step involves CRT proponents grilling CRT critics as to why they are so \"scared\" to \"discuss racism\" or \"discuss slavery,\" as if that applied to anyone other than a truly infinitesimal and politically powerless fringe subset.\n\nSecond, while publicly seizing the moral high ground, CRT proponents simultaneously work behind the scenes to advance what it is that they actually believe. Consider this forthright (and harrowing) admission from Critical Race Theory: An Introduction , a 2001 book from Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic: \"Unlike traditional civil rights, which embraces incrementalism and step-by-step progress, critical race theory questions the very foundations of the liberal order, including equality theory, legal reasoning, Enlightenment rationalism and neutral principles of constitutional law.\"\n\nCRT proponents, in line with the \"anti-racism\" movement and vogue notions of \"equity,\" candidly advocate for discrimination-as long as it is anti-white, anti-Asian, anti-Christian or anti-Jewish. As leading CRT \"anti-racist\" intellectual Ibram X. Kendi wrote in 2019's How to Be an Antiracist : \"The only remedy to racist discrimination is anti-racist discrimination. The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.\"\n\nIn practice, as courageous investigative journalists such as the Manhattan Institute's Chris Rufo have laid bare for all to see , CRT takes the form of crass racial indoctrination that ascribes collective and historical guilt to white Americans, urging white parents of schoolchildren to seek \"white abolition\" and accusing schools of wantonly \"spirit murdering\" black children. The two-step CRT apologia described is thus willfully dishonest. It is a bad-faith argument, pure and simple. In formal logic, we would recognize it as a prototypical motte-and-bailey fallacy .\n\nIt is, furthermore, a logical fallacy committed to advancing profoundly un-American notions of collectivized and racially hierarchical guilt and innocence. This weekend, as we recall the most famous exhortation in the Declaration of Independence, \"that all men are created equal,\" we should consider just how antithetical CRT is to that most foundational American principle. That principle of real, genuine human equality, subsequently woven into our legal and social fabric via the 14th Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, sits in an irreconcilable state of tension with the crass and overt anti-white bigotry embodied by CRT.\n\nCRT in most forms is already illegal under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, but many Republican-governed states have gone further, crafting and passing new legislation to specifically ban CRT pedagogy from corrupting their impressionable youth. While every piece of legislation or regulatory rule is distinct and must be legally assessed on its own merits, these states are absolutely correct to ban CRT indoctrination against the protestations of both left-liberal and right-liberal critics.\n\nMany arguing against the states' CRT bans resort to trite First Amendment appeals. \"You're infringing on teachers' speech!\" they risibly claim. Nonsense. A public school classroom is not a utopian \"marketplace of ideas\" derived from an Enlightenment-era political pamphlet. On the contrary, states in our constitutional order retain near-plenary power to craft their educational curricula. If the First Amendment-appealing crowd were intellectually consistent, they would similarly object to a state education bureaucracy banning the teaching of Holocaust denial. And if the secular leftists among this cohort were consistent, they would presumably object to a state's ban on teaching the Book of Genesis' creation story. They won't.\n\nMore generally, any society that takes the bare minimum amount of pride required to wish to sustain itself for its progeny must understand that instilling racially divisive poison in the minds of impressionable students is a recipe for disaster. No nation will long endure if its youngest generation is full of disdain, disgust and self-hatred. The traditional goal of education, as the Founders conceived it, was to help inculcate the sound republican habits of mind and civic virtues necessary for a flourishing polity. Suffice it to say we have deviated far from that, but surely we can at least ban pedagogies that are often outright deceitful -such as The New York Times ' much-criticized \"1619 Project\"-and are always dedicated to collective self-immolation.\n\nBanning CRT is neither coercive nor liberty-infringing. Rather, it is a prudent and necessary first step to salvaging a fractious nation teetering on the brink of collapse.\n\nJosh Hammer is Newsweek opinion editor, a syndicated columnist and a research fellow with the Edmund Burke Foundation.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nAs the debate over critical race theory rages on, a conservative group has said teachers in states where it is banned are getting around the rules behind closed doors.\n\nAccuracy in Media (AIM) said it found through undercover interviews in Idaho and Tennessee that school administrators had admitted to racial-oriented and other curriculum components being taught under different names. Both are Republican states where laws have been passed to prevent CRT from being a part of the curriculum .\n\nThe teaching of critical race theory, which holds that racism is embedded in America's legal system and institutions, has become a political battleground between liberals and conservatives.\n\n\"What was abundantly clear from many administrators is that they are quite clever with coming up with ways to get CRT into the curriculum even when it's illegal,\" said AIM President Adam Guillette.\n\n\"It's diabolical the ways they come up with to rebrand the law,\" he told Newsweek.\n\nVideo recordings from Idaho and Tennessee show school officials describing how teachers are still able to address the same subjects with students despite a ban, Guillette said.\n\n\"It's the fox guarding the hen house because these administrators are all for these concepts being taught in classrooms,\" said Guillette.\n\n\"Parents should be alarmed and terrified because one overarching theme from administrators that we found around the country again and again is that at the end of the day, teachers can close the door and do whatever they want.\n\n\"If this is what happens in states where it's illegal, what's happening in other states?\" he asked.\n\nConservatives say that teaching children about critical race theory is divisive while liberals say it is important for a better understanding of society and for countering racism.\n\nThe battle over critical race theory has brought accusations from some parents that its concepts are being brought into other parts of the curriculum, such as social-emotional learning classes.\n\nIn Caldwell, Idaho, Melissa Langan, the chief academic officer of the Caldwell School District told Guillette in the video that she recently attended a superintendents' meeting at which it was recommended to refer to social-emotional learning as \"Behavior Adaptations.\"\n\n\"Changed the label, same stuff. And I thought, it's kind of a bummer they have to do that, but at the same time it was kind of brilliant,\" she said in the taped video. \"Because they don't care about this, even though it's the same as this. But it's the label. So I thought it was brilliant on their part.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Langan for comment.\n\nIn Idaho's Nampa School District, Cindy Dion, a district instructional coach also told Guillette that the phrase \"social emotional learning\" is now frowned upon.\n\n\"Social-emotional learning, we can't say that anymore ... so you know it's just our mental health curriculum-who's against mental health curriculum? Not me,\" said Dion, noting that staff there are trying to make that transition. \"... So you know we're not doing social-emotional learning - it's all mental health. It's just the different words you have to use and of course we don't do CRT. We don't. So, yeah...\"\n\n\"We're just learning how to worm around all of those weird things that are out there,\" added Dion.\n\nLater in the video, she also acknowledged that while the 1619 Project- The New York Times initiative that aims to reframe U.S. history by incorporating the consequences of slavery and the contributions of Black Americans as central to the country's narrative- was off-limits, the district staff has access to other resources from companies such as Newsela.\n\nNewsela is an ed-tech startup company brands its platform as \"taking real and new content from trusted providers and turning it into learning materials.\" Its standards-aligned informational content is said to serve 37 million K-12 students and 2.5 million teachers. It is also a direct partner of the 1619 Project.\n\n\"...When you ban something called critical race theory, they rebrand it as social and emotional learning. When you ban social and emotional learning, they call it mental health. When you ban the 1619 Project, they sign up for a service called Newsela, which pushes the exact same ideas,\" said Guillette, in the video's narration. \"It's clear that the only solution to this is school choice.\"\n\nIn a statement to Newsweek , the Nampa School District noted that AIM 's video was unauthorized and described Dion as not authorized to speak officially on behalf of the district.\n\n\"The Nampa School District does not now, nor has it ever, ascribed to a position of teaching content that is objectionable to our community. Our top priority is providing a safe and enriching environment where children can learn and prepare for the next stage of life,\" the statement read.\n\nIt also noted that the clip shows the employee's responses in a way that misinterprets their meaning.\n\n\"The district has not changed the name of SEL; rather, adding the words \"mental health\" seeks to help clarify what is being taught. Similarly, important social studies topics such as civil rights history continue to be taught, although as the employee pointed out, some less experienced teachers might shy away from deeper discussions due to the current political climate,\" it also read.\n\nGuillette said the tenets of critical race theory are often taught under the \"equity\" guise as he noted to Mark Jones, administrator of student programs for the Boise School District.\n\n\"Yes, and well, we have ... we started ... part of our strategic plan deals with equity,\" responded Jones in the video. \"And we have ... One of our supervisors is \"World Studies, Social Studies and Equity.\"\n\nGuillette acknowledged the belief of many school officials that teaching CRT is what's best for students.\n\n\"Administrators aren't evil one-dimensional villains-they think they're doing what's right for the children. But what they think is right for your child might not be what a parent thinks is right for their child,\" Guillette told Newsweek .\n\nHis non-profit group also made an undercover video showing school officials in Tennessee describing how teachers are able to teach CRT components despite a ban by the state legislature. In all, seven states have banned the teaching of CRT in schools.\n\n\"It's not actively being taught, but it's not actively not being taught,\" said Kimberly Shurett, director of early grades academic support in the state's Marion County Schools.\n\n\"This law was really well-crafted and accomplishes nothing,\" added Todd Wigginton, director of social studies for the Metro Nashville Public Schools.\n\nFor his part, Guillette reiterated the group's investigation confirmed time and again that ultimately teachers that want to teach CRT in their classroom often find a way to do so.\n\n\"I think it's morally outrageous that administrators and educators are ignoring state laws to push racist Marxist ideas,\" said Guillette. \"It speaks to the ineffectiveness of the CRT bans that might placate voters but don't accomplish anything.\"\n\nUpdated on 03/29/2022 at 06.22 a.m. ET with additional material.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nA growing number of parents of K-12 and high school students throughout the country have rebelled against the teaching of critical race theory (CRT) and \"anti-racism\" in public and private schools. The reasons for their alarm vary, and the rhetorical battles can be confusing, but it is not hard to get to the heart of parents' objections.\n\nThey reject the presentation of our country, its history, its founding, its institutions and its present laws and practices as pervasively, uniformly, profoundly and irredeemably racist. Nor do they accept the corollary that all white Americans automatically enjoy illegitimate \"white privilege\"-and that they are to blame for every problem that people of color, especially blacks, experience today.\n\nWe think that these tenets are dubious at best. But in our opinion the most pernicious aspect of CRT instruction, from an educational perspective, is not its content, but the one-sided, dogmatic intolerance of any alternative point of view.\n\nCRT banishes any classroom mention, let alone thoughtful discussion, of the full range of ideas about race currently articulated across the political spectrum. (The same thing is true in corporate America and at universities, where employees know better than to openly object to CRT's rigid dogmas.) The CRT-approved story, in a nutshell, is that white racism is pervasive and accounts for all racial deficits and disparities. What is not being taught-what students are not exposed to, and not even allowed to hear-is the contrary position that persistent racial inequalities are oftentimes rooted in cultural differences and behavioral tendencies that are not all traceable to slavery or Jim Crow, and cannot all be solved by purging the vague category of \"structural racism.\"\n\nOne of the central elements of the \"anti-racism\" creed, which conveniently allows CRT to be presented as unvarnished, unquestionable truth, is that any critique, challenge or argument against it, however grounded in evidence, history or logic, is by definition a racist expression of an oppressive system of \"whiteness.\" According to CRT proponents, that system must be wholly discredited, dismantled and expunged, both to achieve \"racial justice\" and to spare non-whites from trauma, exclusion and an \"unsafe\" environment.\n\nThese rhetorical maneuvers render it disingenuous and a classic straw man to suggest that the goal of parents' anti-CRT efforts is to suppress teaching and learning \"about the role of racism in the history of the United States.\" Virtually no one opposes that. CRT goes much further in advancing unbalanced and unbending ideas on how race figures in our history and at present, and in seeking to suppress, tarnish and banish any alternative approach to those thorny questions.\n\nThe effort to present one ideology on race and to discredit other perspectives as racist, bigoted and baseless is a form of partisan propaganda that is contrary to sound educational practice. But it is also antithetical to principles on which our nation was founded-and represents a dangerous attack on the essence of the American way of life.\n\nParents and teachers must unite in unequivocally rejecting the illiberal and pernicious notion that the repudiation of CRT is itself a form of impermissible racism. Insisting on viewpoint diversity and the airing of different ways of thinking about race in America is essential to reclaiming our education system from the noxious grip of CRT advocates and acolytes. It is also vital to defending traditions of critical thinking, reasoned discourse, academic freedom and First Amendment protections that are strengths of our system.\n\nThere are currently political efforts underway to ban the teaching of certain ideas-including the one-sided, negative views of America peddled by CRT proponents-from academic curricula at public institutions. More effective might be legislative mandates for viewpoint diversity and evidence-based learning, if only as a reminder that taxpayers expect First Amendment values to be honored by the institutions they financially support.\n\nA positive outcome of such efforts, supported by the grassroots activism of parents committed to our traditional practices and values, would be to ensure that students are routinely exposed to a range of ideas on questions of race in America. While our preference would be for schools to stick to basics rather than to grant precious instructional time to current events and political debates, any discussion of the complex subject of race in America-whether historical or contemporaneous-should be balanced by a presentation, or at the least an acknowledgement, of differing perspectives and the facts and analysis behind them.\n\nWe are in the midst of a lively national debate about the role of slavery, discrimination and racism in our country and its design, as well as the origins and solutions to current racial inequalities. Students need exposure not merely to left-leaning ideas on these questions but also to centrist and right-leaning positions, including those advanced by distinguished minority thinkers like Jason Riley, Thomas Sowell, Shelby Steele, Wilfred Reilly, Glenn Loury, Bob Woodson, John McWhorter, Coleman Hughes, Candace Owens and many others. Students need to consider the possibility that high rates of some destructive behaviors, such as crime and family breakdown, are more important than white racism in holding blacks back. They need to hear why some critics think that cultural reform and self-help, and not the endless and indignant pursuit of white racism, might be the best long-term answer.\n\nCRT ideology seeks to suppress, hide and delegitimate these ideas by keeping them out of the schools and banishing them from educational curricula. Many students and parents have never even been exposed to these perspectives and have not taken them as seriously as they deserve. It's time for that to change. That's called an education.\n\nAmy L.

However, Republican lawmakers appear to have given the term a broader meaning, applying it to any education that involves teaching about race and intersectionality. Dozens of bills are in motion or have passed that prohibit the theory from being taught in schools and Republicans have also cracked down on texts they deem as too controversial to be taught or read.\n\nA disproportionate number of authors who appear to have been impacted by these moves are writers of color and authors from LGBTQ+ backgrounds.\n\nIn October 2021, Republican Texas state Rep. Matt Krause released a list of about 850 books that he claimed \"make students feel discomfort\" due to their content about race and sexuality. Krause urged school libraries to report whether they had any of the books.\n\nHe did not explain what the next steps might be, but his request mentioned several pushes to remove books from libraries and classrooms if they center on issues from transgender identity to critical race theory.\n\nAmong the books, was Mikki Kendall's non-fiction book Hood Feminism, and Kalynn Bayron's 2020 novel Cinderella Is Dead. Ovidia Molina, the president of the Texas State Teachers Association, decried Krause's move, calling it \"disturbing and political overreach into the classroom\" and potentially illegal, at the time, according to a statement.\n\nSpeaking to Newsweek about Krause's clampdown on books about race and sexuality , Kendall said: \" I spent exactly enough time figuring out that the people calling for these book bans have largely never read the books and ceased to take them seriously as critics. Like Krause, many of the people pushing for these bans are running for local office and have nothing of substance to say so they've chosen to attack books in hopes no one will notice they're hacks running a political con job in hopes of winning an office.\"\n\nHood Feminism argues that mainstream feminists rarely talk about meeting basic needs as a feminist issue and that white feminists can sometimes be blind to how race, class and sexuality interact with feminism.\n\nKendall said that many of the people who accuse her of writing about CRT don't understand the theory or know where it's taught-primarily in college and law school.\n\n\"Children who can think for themselves and analyze information are the biggest danger to bigots who are trying desperately to cling to an imaginary past,\" Kendall said. \"As for the idea that I can be accused of teaching critical race theory, it's not a crime to have information or to share it.\"\n\nShe said that America has always struggled with the idea of free speech for marginalized people, but it's just more visible now in the age of social media.\n\n\"This is an old fight, and I certainly don't intend to lose it. More importantly I certainly don't intend to only rely on school libraries. Kids use the internet so I'll talk about these concepts on Twitter , TikTok , in talks at schools and bookstores.\"\n\nAsked whether she plans to appeal her books being removed, Kendall said: \"I'll join a lawsuit with the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] or other such body if it becomes necessary but I'm not asking for kids to be given access to education. I'm demanding it.\n\n\"Whether it is my books or anyone else's that actual experts who have read the books and whose job it is to set curriculums have chosen to include in a school library, I don't think one whiny parent or political hack should ever have the right to curtail access to information for all the kids in a district.\"\n\nBayron found out that Cinderella is Dead was on the list on social media late in 2021.\n\n\"I read through the list of 800+ books that Krause was targeting and realized that this wasn't specifically about critical race theory, but about racism, homophobia, and misogyny. Stories began to trickle in of my work being removed from libraries across Texas and in some other states as well,\" Bayron told Newsweek.\n\nAddressing critics, she said would challenge them to define to her the ways in which CRT is applied to her work.\n\n\"I would ask them if they know who Kimberlé Crenshaw [CRT pioneer] is and if they can cite her. Many people supporting these bans do not have a solid understanding of what critical race theory actually is and how it is applied. They use the term as a dog whistle,\" Bayron said.\n\nShe added that the removal of the books set a \"terrible precedent,\" but that she did not fear \"willful ignorance.\"\n\n\"It directly harms young readers by narrowing their world view. Not everyone in this world is white, straight, cis [cisgender] and heterosexual. You can cultivate empathy and compassion by fostering a learning environment that is rich in inclusion. Isn't that what we want? To allow our children to be compassionate and helpful and genuinely interested in the well-being of others?\n\n\"The fear and ignorance driving these efforts is based solely in white supremacy and patriarchal ideologies that have dominated our social and political landscape for generations. It's hurting me as a creator, yes, but it's also hurting young readers and that, in my mind, is absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\nShe is working with her publisher to address the removal of her books.\n\n\"I am concerned that people will give in to the pressure being applied but I'm much more concerned for my young readers who are looking for depictions of themselves in the books they read. I understand what it's like to search for yourself in the pages of some epic adventure and find nothing. It's an incredibly isolating and disheartening experience.\n\n\"If I had my way, I would never allow another single young reader to feel the pain that deliberate exclusion based on race, gender, or sexual identity brings. I will continue to advocate loudly for my readers and the librarians and educators who support them.\"\n\nTiffany D. Jackson, who wrote the 2018 novel Monday's Not Coming, faces a similar predicament. At a school board meeting in May 2021 in Loudoun County, Virginia, parents demanded that the author's book be banned for \"sexual content,\" according to the Loudoun-Times Mirror.\n\nThe book touches on friendship, dyslexia, healing and mentions sex, though it is not acted upon, she said.\n\nJackson told Newsweek that her book had been \"on the hit list for a while now,\" but in May 2021 she chose not to speak about the school board reaction because she was grieving the death of her aunt.\n\nShe said that many people who accuse her of teaching CRT do not even know what the theory is, and \"that seems to be the biggest problem.\"\n\nJackson said that her accusers likely haven't read her book, which she says is about shining a light on missing Black children.\n\n\"It barely fits the qualifications of actual CRT. So one would assume the only reason it's being banned is because it features Black children living in our current society. And that makes these parents' silent racism incredibly loud.\"\n\nShe has no plans to appeal the school board's decision.\n\n\"My next book The Weight of Blood talks about microaggressions, racism and segregation. It'll probably be banned as well. I have a long hard road ahead of me as a Black author.\"\n\nJack Dutton is a Newsweek Reporter based in Cape Town, South Africa.

      "text": "Critical Race Theory Has No Idea What To Do With Asian Americans | Opinion\n\nAdvocates for ideas and draws conclusions based on the interpretation of facts and data.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nOne of today's most vexing federal lawsuits is Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard , which has brought anti-Asian discrimination to the forefront of our discourse. Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) contends that Harvard's \"race-conscious\" admissions process violates the Constitution by disadvantaging Asian American applicants based solely upon their race, while Harvard argues that campus diversity goals justify its race-conscious process.\n\nMuch of the reasoning behind Harvard's admissions process comes from critical race theory (CRT), a theory of race that actually originated at Harvard University. CRT teaches that America is divided into privileged and oppressed racial groups. All negative aspects of modern society flow from that overly simplistic dichotomy.\n\nUnder the CRT framework, \"white supremacy\" covers many different phenomena. Everything from blatant discrimination to the existence of English grammar to choosing not to riot are sometimes included under the term. And in the words of \"anti-racist\" activist and author Ibram X. Kendi, \"The only remedy to racist discrimination is anti-racist discrimination. The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.\" In order to combat white supremacy-however broadly defined-critical race theorists view \"anti-racist\" discrimination as the only legitimate response.\n\nHowever, with the emergence of several racial groups that have come to be just as successful as whites, critical race theorists have come up with the term, \"white adjacency.\" Robin DiAngelo, author of the now-infamous book White Fragility , defines it this way: \"The closer you are to whiteness-the term often used is white-adjacent-you're still going to experience racism, but there are going to be some benefits due to your perceived proximity to whiteness. The further away you are, the more intense the oppression's going to be.\" According to CRT advocates, Asian Americans are the most \"white-adjacent\" minority.\n\nWhat does this mean, in practice? In my new book, An Inconvenient Minority , I tell the story of the many Asian Americans who are harmed by an ideology that penalizes their success. Progressives, I argue, \"call out Asians for either trying to be like white people or benefiting from systems that prop up white dominance.\" Under the logic of CRT, it also means Asians are complicit in upholding white supremacy. To be \"white-adjacent\" is to benefit from the systems of oppression upon which America was allegedly founded.\n\nApplying the words of Kendi, then, means that Asians are a privileged group against whom discrimination is justified in order to make room for the \"truly\" oppressed.\n\nBut is the concept of \"white adjacency\" actually valid? In reality, \"white adjacency\" is simply a rhetorical tool to discriminate against Asian Americans. It is an implicitly racist concept itself.\n\nThe idea of \"white adjacency\" hinges on the overwhelming success of Asian Americans in this country. It emerges from the fact that Asian Americans have the highest per-capita income , lowest per-capita crime rates and highest rates of college education . In fact, Asian Americans score better on average than whites on all of these metrics.\n\nThe problem is that CRT implicitly defines every good societal outcome as \"white.\" Based on the data, this necessarily puts Asian Americans in a \"white adjacent\" box that completely ignores their unique cultures and historical struggles. Furthermore, if being rich and successful are necessarily \"white\" characteristics, the implication is that other races are not, or cannot be, successful, talented or educated. Despite pretending to care about diversity and inclusion, CRT is actually racist in the way it implicitly categorizes groups of people.\n\nAsians are harmed in multiple ways by the \"white adjacency\" myth. Asian Americans have struggled in this country, as well-let us not forget the Chinese Exclusion Act or World War II-era Japanese internment. Yet, the concept is frequently used to silence Asian Americans when they attempt to explain their own struggles. It also gives universities such as Harvard the required justification to discriminate against Asian American applicants. Asians are an inconvenient minority because their idiosyncratic high performance is a threat to prevailing woke narratives about diversity and the myth of a largely-white hegemony in the Ivy League. As the coastal elite continues to double down on CRT, Asian Americans will continue to be a thorn in their side.\n\nAsian Americans are not \"white-adjacent.\" They are unique individuals from many distinct cultures. Their individual successes are theirs alone, and belittling those successes as \"white-adjacent\" is racist in myriad ways. It has to stop.\n\nKenny Xu is the author of An Inconvenient Minority , which exposes racial discrimination against Asian Americans at elite universities like Harvard and Yale. He is the president of Color Us United , which advocates for a race-blind America.\n\nThe view expressed in this article are the writer's own.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

      "text": "Is Opposition to Critical Race Theory Correlated with Ignorance of Critical Race Theory?\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nDavid Bernstein | 4.2.2024 9:08 AM\n\nA new academic study by Brianna Richmond, et al., purports to show that opposition to Critical Race Theory is correlated with ignorance of CRT. The quiz the authors use, however, to determine the level of knowledge of CRT is quite problematic. CRT, being a body of academic work, does not have a singular position on various issues, making any such \"quiz\" difficult. But with that said, the quiz is structured so that the answers reflect how many CRT advocates would like CRT to be seen for PR purposes, rather than a reasonable interpretation of what CRT often stands for. Let's go through the questions:\n\n1. Which of the following is suggested by Critical Race Theory? White Americans are naturally racist [lure] Racism is an individual problem People should be judged by their skin color Certain laws in America have played a role in perpetuating racial inequality [correct]\n\nIn their paper, the authors describe the lure as white people are born racist, but that's not necessarily what \"naturally\" means. It could mean, for example, whites grow up in a racist society, so, *naturally*, i.e., the natural/expected consequences is, that they are racist, which is in fact what CRT often teaches. As for the third choice, do some Critical Race Theorists argue that in some circumstances different standards should apply to whites than to BIPOC or People of Color? Yes. So that answer is correct as well. As for the official correct answer, belief that laws in America have played a role in perpetuating racial inequality is not at all specific to CRT, to say the least.\n\n2. What group is credited with creating Critical Race Theory (CRT)? Academic scholars [correct] Political radicals [lure] The media (i.e. newspapers) Elementary school teachers\n\nI can't think of any of the founders of Critical Race Theory who wouldn't qualify as political radicals. Indeed, CRT is a self-consciously radical movement, not that there is anything inherently wrong with that. So both the lure and the official correct answer are correct.\n\n3. Where is Critical Race Theory generally implemented? Elementary schools [lure] Law schools [correct] Congress West coast schools\n\nCRT is much more prevalent and much more overt in law schools than in elementary schools, but there are only 190 law schools and tens of thousands of elementary schools, so the lure is again as good an answer as the putatively correct one, depending on whether one interprets \"generally\" as meaning prevalence or total presence.\n\n4. A survey of African American adolescents found that 50% of them reported having experienced what at their school during the last 3 months? Receiving a lower grade than deserved Being wrongly disciplined or given detention by a teacher Being called racial slurs by other kids at school [correct] Feeling proud of their racial heritage because of learning CRT [lure]\n\nFirst, let me say that this correct answer suggests an appalling reality. That said, I don't see what this question has to do with CRT, as such. It asks about an empirical finding, and Critical Race Theory doesn't have any monopoly on empirical research, and indeed some strands of CRT are hostile to empirics.\n\n5. What implications does Critical Race Theory have for American history? CRT rewrites American history to make Whites look bad and to advantage minorities [lure] CRT explores the lasting effects of slavery/racism in institutions and systems [correct] CRT teaches that Americans should be ashamed about their history CRT ignores what makes America exceptional and makes it seem like any other country\n\nI wouldn't say the lure is correct, because I don't think CRT historical scholarship is trying to make whites look bad and advantage minorities, and some historical scholarship by people affiliated with CRT is quite good. On the other hand, there is CRT-adjacent writing that does rewrite history in rather blatant ways. See, eg, Kendi & Reynolds Stamped: A Remix--though the authors begin the book by claiming that there history book isn't a history book. The official correct answer is indeed correct. But I think the next two choices are at least not incorrect. Surely, CRT teaches that Americans should be ashamed about some or even much of their history (and in some cases, most obviously slavery, they are correct!). And CRT-affiliated scholars are highly unlikely to buy into \"American exceptionalism.\"\n\n6. White students in a summer camp who were exposed to history lessons about racism reported: Being bored and uninterested Valuing racial fairness more [correct] Feeling more negative attitudes toward White people [lure] Less interest in math and science\n\nOK, but what do knowing about the reactions of students \"exposed to history lessons about racism\" have to do with one's knowledge of Critical Race Theory?\n\n7. Critical Race Theory was developed in conjunction with: Marxism Black Lives Matter [lure] The 1619 Project Intersectionality [correct]\n\nMarxism is probably the best answer here. Early work on Critical Race Theory, most prominently by Derrick Bell, predated \"intersectionality,\" but was clearly influenced by Marxism in general, and Critical Legal Studies, itself a Marxist offshoot, in particular. The correct answer is also correct.\n\n8. How does Critical Race Theory interpret the Constitution? CRT rejects the Constitution as an invalid document CRT denounces the Constitution as conservative propaganda [lure] CRT views the Constitution as sacred, holy, and inviolable CRT explores how the text of the original Constitution and its amendments affected racial relations in America [correct]\n\n\"Rejects the Constitution as an invalid document\" is perfectly fine answer, though of course this will vary depending on who one is talking to, and what one means by \"invalid.\" As for the correct answer, many non-CRT scholars, including me, have done the same thing, it's not at all specific to CRT.\n\n9. What does Critical Race Theory say about White people? Critical Race Theory teaches White people they should feel guilty and ashamed. [lure] Critical Race Theory suggests that racism between White and Black people is inevitable. Critical Race Theory argues that achieving racial justice and equality between racial groups requires discriminating against White people. Critical Race Theory indicates that White people have benefited from decades of laws designed to benefit White people but not other groups. [correct]\n\nAll of these answers are correct. The three answers coded as incorrect are more closely associated with CRT than the correct answer. With regard to \"guilty and ashamed,\" there is a whole line of CRT scholarship, especially in psychology and anthropology, arguing that whites must develop \"white racial consciousness\" to recognize their privilege, and then become woke based on that recognition. Seems to me one can reasonably interpret this as saying white people should first feel guilty about their privilege, and then ashamed if they aren't using that privilege in anti-racist activism. I suppose saying that CRT suggests that racism is inevitable is a bit of an exaggeration, but it certainly suggests that it is an intractable problem in the US, and some like Derrick Bell have argued that any seeming amelioration of racism since the 1950s is an illusion. Finally, CRT scholars may bristle at affirmative action preferences being described as \"discriminating against white people\" it's hardly a \"wrong\" answer if a respondent feels otherwise.\n\nNow, it would hardly surprise me if most Americans who have an opinion on CRT don't know much about it. As co-blogger Ilya Somin has often noted, the most Americans are remarkably ignorant about most political issues, even the most well-publicized ones. But I don't think this study is helpful in showing that ignorance of CRT is correlated with hostility to it.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Suzanna Sherry on DEI/Critical Race Theory and Antisemitism\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nDavid Bernstein | 4.2.2024 6:34 PM\n\nProfessor Sherry is an emerita professor at Vanderbilt Law School. Back in 1997, she and Professor Daniel Farber wrote a book, Beyond All Reason , critiquing Critical Race Theory. Perhaps their most controversial argument was that Critical Race Theory, in denying that there was such a thing as objective merit, and attributing all group differences to racism, was implicitly antisemitic in its inability to explain American Jewish success without resorting to antisemitic conspiracy theory.\n\nProfessor Sherry (who, by the way, is a political liberal), has written a short followup, DEI and Antisemitism: Bred in the Bone . Here is the abstract:\n\nLast October, progressive Jews were shocked by the raw antisemitism displayed by their erstwhile allies on the political left. After Hamas terrorists tortured, raped, or murdered more than 1200 Israeli civilians and took some 200 civilians hostage, some progressives - especially on college campuses - celebrated. They chanted the Palestinian mantra \"from the river to the sea,\" seeking to erase Israel (and Jews) from the face of the earth. The number of antisemitic incidents on campus soared, coming from both students and faculty. A Stanford lecturer forced Jewish students to the back of the classroom and labeled them \"colonizers.\" Jewish students had to barricade themselves inside a library at Cooper Union, and Jewish students at MIT were told by faculty to avoid the university's main lobby for their own safety. Many university presidents who had previously sent out campus-wide emails condemning the murder of George Floyd, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the overruling of Roe v. Wade, and countless other world events suddenly discovered the Kalven Principles and claimed it would be inappropriate for them to take sides, or issued weak statements about how the situation in the Middle East was complicated. This double standard continued as some universities responded to student calls for genocide of Jews by invoking principles of free speech, principles that had been notably ignored when the speech in question was directed at other groups. Most campus DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) offices, especially at the most elite universities, had nothing to say about the surging antisemitism.\n\nThis essay explains why no one should have been shocked, or even mildly surprised, by the progressive response to the massacre. Progressive or \"woke\" culture -as exemplified by critical race theory, anti-racism of the Ibram X. Kendi variety, and, especially on college campuses, the DEI juggernaut - is necessarily and inevitably antisemitic at its core. That these related movements have now exposed their antisemitism publicly is no surprise: antisemitism is bred in their bones.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Critical Race Theory Can't Be Banned. It Can Be Exposed, Mocked, and Avoided.\n\nCritical Race Theory\n\nRobby Soave | 6.29.2021 4:39 PM\n\nAlarm about critical race theory-a previously obscure field of study pioneered by far-left legal scholars and sociologists-has suddenly gripped the political right. This development has forced the right's adversaries on Team Blue to defend a theory that very few people on either side of this increasingly silly debate could accurately define if challenged to do so.\n\nAt least Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley was honest. Last week, under intense grilling by House Republicans, he conceded that he would \"have to get much smarter on whatever the theory is.\" Nevertheless, he thought there was certainly a place for it in university classrooms; after all, students of history study communism and fascism, not because those were good ideas, but because it's important to learn why they failed.\n\n\"The United States Military Academy is a university,\" said Milley. \"It is important that we train and we understand. I want to understand white rage, and I'm white. And I want to understand it.\"\n\nIn response, the conservative writer J.D. Vance quipped that U.S. generals should read less about \"white rage\" and more about \"not losing wars.\"\n\nIt's a troll-ish response that captures so much of what is wrong with the current public meltdown about critical race theory (CRT): Practically no one agrees on-or even appears to understand-what CRT is and how far it has spread.\n\nSo let's just get this out of the way: Critical race theory is the idea that structural racism is embedded in many U.S. institutions. Slavery was the reality when the country was founded, and segregation endured for a century following the Civil War. It would thus be naive to assume that supposedly race-neutral policies are actually race-neutral-there's nothing neutral about America and race. Working from this assumption, adherents of critical race theory tend toward a kind of progressive activism that views post-Enlightenment classical liberalism and its notions of equal opportunity, the prioritization of individual rights over group rights, and colorblindness with hostility.\n\nSince very few people involved in the CRT debate have had much experience with the above definition, nearly everybody who has waded into this controversy is right about some things and wrong about many other things.\n\nSavvier liberals are correct, for instance, that CRT, as defined by the people who actually coined the term , mostly exists in academia, not K-12 classrooms. This means that Republican legislative efforts to protect kids from CRT are actually targeting a wide swath of only semi-related progressive concepts. These bills are almost uniformly heavy-handed, and in some cases represent active threats to freedom of expression in the classroom.\n\nPennsylvania's anti-CRT bill , for instance, would prohibit university professors from teaching any \"racist or sexist concept\" or bringing an outside speaker to campus who does the same. Remember when conservatives were outraged about the disinvitation campaigns waged against campus speakers like Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos? Well, this bill would make disinvitation the law of the land. University bureaucrats would have to scroll through prospective speakers' Twitter feeds, on the hunt for statements that could be read as racist or sexist. (This would obviously not benefit socially conservative speakers, many of whom do, after all, believe that there are differences between men and women and different roles for them in society.)\n\nAt the same time, anti-CRT folks on the right are correct that there are a whole host of progressive writers, teachers, and activists who were clearly inspired by critical race theory-a field that does in fact include fairly radical ideas, some of which run contrary to the colorblind liberalism of previous racial equality advocacy. Whether or not these people would admit to being adherents of CRT is almost beside the point.\n\nIncluded in this mix are two of the least persuasive anti-racism writers: White Fragility author Robin DiAngelo and How to Be Antiracist author Ibram X. Kendi, who are routinely paid thousands of dollars to give short presentations to corporate employees, school administrators, and teachers. Both take wildly flawed approaches; DiAngelo treats racism as a kind of incurable infection, or original sin-John McWhorter accurately accused her of promoting the cultish notion that \"you will never succeed in the 'work' she demands of you...it is lifelong, and you will die a racist just as you will die a sinner.\"\n\nKendi's big idea is to create a U.S. Department of Antiracism. \"The DOA would be responsible for preclearing all local, state and federal public policies to ensure they won't yield racial inequity, monitor those policies, investigate private racist policies when racial inequity surfaces, and monitor public officials for expressions of racist ideas,\" he wrote . This proposal would necessitate the creation of a vast surveillance state and render the First Amendment moot.\n\nNow that critical race theory is under attack, Kendi has denied being an adherent of it, saying in a statement, \"I don't identify as a critical race theorist.\" MSNBC host Joy Reid used this as a gotcha moment during a segment with Christopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and the foremost anti-CRT activist. But this is semantics: Kendi also told Slate that CRT was \"foundational\" to his work:\n\nI've certainly been inspired by my critical race theory and critical race theorists, the way in which I've formulated definitions of racism and racist and anti-racism and Antiracist have not only been based on historical sort of evidence, but also Kimberle Crenshaw intersectional theory, which is she's one of the founding and pioneering critical race theorists who in the late 1980s and early 1990s said, you know what, black women aren't just facing racism. They're not just facing sexism. They're facing the intersection of racism and sexism. And it's important for us to understand that. And that's foundational to my work.\n\nThe Department of Antiracism is not an idea that comes to us explicitly from CRT literature, but the man who proposed it views CRT as inexorably tied with his antiracism work. It is thus not entirely unfair for conservatives to use CRT as shorthand for the sorts of things to which they object.\n\nThe person most responsible for this framing-CRT as the avatar of all dubious race and diversity stuff-is undoubtedly Rufo, whose unmatched zeal for exposing it occasionally makes him sound like the sort of activist he is otherwise criticizing. He tweeted , for instance, \"The goal is to have the public read something crazy in the newspaper and immediately think 'critical race theory.' We have decodified the term and will recodify it to annex the entire range of cultural constructions that are unpopular with Americans.\" That's a fairly straightforward admission that he's not really against CRT; his project is raising the salience of CRT so that people will identify the concept with every other thing they don't like.\n\nThis is a project that makes hypocrites out of everyone. Conservatives often take umbrage when progressives redefine words, and progressives counter that language has no fixed meaning. But as Oliver Traldi points out in Arc Digital , the CRT debate has scrambled these usual sides. It is now the right saying that a highly specific word can serve as a stand-in for all sorts of broader ideas, and it is the left saying, no, the right can't do that, only some kind of Critical Race Theory priesthood is qualified to give opinions on what is and isn't CRT. Traldi is quite right that this disagreement is mostly an unhelpful side show. While it's important to be precise-and CRT is not the most precise way to refer to the things that Rufo and Republican legislatures are trying to ban-it's also important to be practical: Words do change, and Rufo has basically succeeded in that project. We could have called this thing intersectionality ( my preferred term ), or progressive antiracism , or even cultural Marxism ( remember that whole debate?), but instead, we're calling it critical race theory. Oh well.\n\nInstead of arguing over what the things they're calling critical race theory ought to be called, people should argue about whether the things they are calling critical race theory are good or bad. On this front, many of the critics of these things make sound arguments. It is true, for instance, that the \"aspects of white supremacy\" charts concocted by progressive antiracism writers Judith Katz and Tema Okun -which posit that punctuality, individualism, and belief in objectivity are traits associated with whiteness-are junk. Punctuality and whiteness have nothing to do with each other. People who strongly cling to the idea that there is such a thing as whiteness, and that it has to do with punctuality, objectivity, and hard-work, are actually promoting harmful and inaccurate racial stereotypes.\n\nYet this thinking clearly undergirds the modern antiracist approach to diversity and inclusion training. Here's an example of a Columbia University professor and diversity instructor informing K-12 educators that black students struggle with \"dissecting and analyzing things\" because Afro-centric epistemology is more context-driven than white epistemology. \"This is why education is not working for so many students of color,\" says the expert.\n\nRecall as well the psychiatrist who delivered a lecture at Yale University's Child Study Center titled \"The Psychopathic Problem of the White Mind.\" The journalist Katie Herzog interviewed the psychiatrist , Aruna Khilanani, for Bari Weiss's newsletter, and it was revelatory. Khilanani is possessed of one of the oddest notions I have ever encountered in my 10 years of critiquing progressive activist tactics and beliefs: She thinks white people refuse to eat bread (?) because they are guilty about their racism and want to starve themselves (??).\n\nSuffice it to say that these are some very weird and unsupported ideas. Are they mandated by critical race theory? No. Do they exist within an increasingly popular strain of diversity and antiracism advocacy and training-training that takes place in schools of education, corporate HR departments, and will increasingly trickle down into the K-12 school system? Yes. If that's what parents are pushing back against when they show up to school board meetings and demand that CRT be banned from the classroom, it's hard to blame them.\n\nNone of that means the legislative remedy is the correct one. Jeffrey Sachs notes that many of the anti-CRT bills are clumsily worded, subject to interpretation, and would likely lead to much self-censorship among teachers and students. And again, the problem is not really that CRT is being taught in K-12 classrooms; the problem is that semi-related concepts (a la DiAngelo, Kendi, Okun, and Katz) have made their way into the kind of instruction that K-12 educators are themselves receiving, either in education schools or during diversity seminars. This is a hard issue for the legislature to overcome.\n\nThe best solution is twofold. First, foes of critical race theory should spend their time more productively by working to ban racial discrimination in schools. Tinkering with the curriculum is usually a local issue, but states can prohibit race-based hiring and admissions systems. Bar elite public high schools from requiring white and Asian students to score higher on entrance exams, and from segregating students by race. David French is also correct that civil rights law already provides a potential avenue for students to sue school districts that have fostered a racially hostile and discriminatory climate. If the thinking behind \"aspects of white supremacy culture\" is put into practice in schools, those schools can be sued.\n\nSecond, Reason 's J.D. Tuccille is completely correct that \"the critical race theory debate wouldn't matter if we had more school choice.\" Families deserve more control over their children's education, and the best way to give it to them is to let students attend whatever school best fits their needs. If parents are concerned that a district is regularly training its teachers to espouse a DiAngelo-esque worldview, the easiest solution is to empower the kids to go elsewhere.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "The Right Way to Reject Critical Race Theory\n\nConservatives have the chance to defend shared values that resonate with many who have not historically found themselves on the right.\n\nThe debate around critical race theory (CRT) can feel exceptionally stupid, reflexive, and marked by bad faith, even by the low standards of our era. Prominent Democrats have excused an assault on the liberal order and the embrace of racial reductionism, while too many Trumpy Republicans have responded to charges of racism and intolerance by seemingly doing their best to prove them true. The performative back and forth, aggravated by uncertainty as to just what CRT entails, can fuel a sense of \"a plague on both your houses.\" But that response, while understandable, is neither principled nor politic. In fact, this clash, seen rightly, is a huge opportunity for a serious conservatism.\n\nCritical race theory, for all the quarrels about precisely what it is and whether it's literally present in schools, really is an avowedly revolutionary and race-obsessed doctrine. As Education Week 's Stephen Sawchuk has observed , \"Critical race theory emerged out of postmodernist thought, which tends to be skeptical of the idea of universal values, objective knowledge, individual merit, Enlightenment rationalism, and liberalism.\" Proponents readily acknowledge such ambitions. As Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic unflinchingly explained in their book Critical Race Theory: An Introduction, \"Critical race theory questions the very foundations of the liberal order, including equality theory, legal reasoning, Enlightenment rationalism, and neutral principles of constitutional law.\"\n\nIn short, the CRT debate has never been about whether schools should \"teach kids about slavery.\" Rather, CRT is a toxic doctrine that encompasses an array of troubling practices, including race-based affinity groups (in which schools separate students or staff by race for instructional purposes); exercises like \"privilege walks\" (in which students or staff are told to catalog identities and circumstances-like race, appearance, sexual preference, or number of books in the home-for hints of  unearned privilege and \"white supremacy culture\"); or the insistence that schools reject \"colorblind\" norms (which the Biden administration supported by recommending resources explaining that such a mindset creates an \"unsafe environment\" for students).\n\nWhen pushed to address these troubling practices, Democratic officials have opted for obfuscation. In the heat of Virginia's gubernatorial campaign, Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe insisted , \"[CRT] is not taught in Virginia, it's never been taught in Virginia. And as I've said this a lot: It's a dogwhistle. It's racial, it's division, and it's used by Glenn Youngkin ... to divide people.\" American Federation of Teachers chief Randi Weingarten thundered , \"Let's be clear: Critical race theory is not taught in elementary schools or high schools. It's a method of examination taught in law school and college that helps analyze whether systemic racism exists.\"\n\nSuch responses are emphatic. They're also untrue. Indeed, internal documents show that, during McAuliffe's previous tenure as governor, a Virginia Department of Education training program encouraged state public schools to \"embrace critical race theory\" and \"engage in race-conscious teaching and learning\" in order to advance \"Culturally-Responsive Teaching and Learning Principles.\"\n\nEven this summer, in Virginia's Loudoun County, a freedom of information request found that Loudoun's schools \"anti-racist\" trainings taught teachers to reject \"color blindness,\" address their \"Whiteness (e.g., white privilege),\" and recognize that \"independence and individual achievement\" are racist hallmarks of \"white individualism\" (as is a commitment to \"self-expression, individual thinking, personal choice\").\n\nIt is neither racist nor unreasonable to reject such teachings as wholly at odds with widely shared American values. These dogmas display an educational vision that's one-part crude racial caricature and one-part half-baked campus Marxism. When confronted with the true face of CRT, rather than the sanitized \"we just want to discuss Jim Crow\" version favored by NPR and the New York Times , it's one that most Americans-of every race-would emphatically reject.\n\nRasmussen reported in July that 74 percent of black voters say it's important to teach the \"traditional values of Western civilization,\" not too far off from the 78 percent of white voters who say the same. While the question is more than a little vague, such responses sure don't suggest much enthusiasm for CRT's frontal assault on the liberal order. Indeed, black and white Americans sound an awful lot alike when asked about values that have been deemed \"white supremacist\" by anti-racist trainers. Sixty-four percent of white Americans and 67 percent of black Americans say it's important to teach persistence. On the virtue of hard work, the respective figures are 90 and 91 percent; on \"independence,\" they're 76 and 81 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, Latinos may be the nation's most culturally conservative demographic. Pew has reported that 77 percent of Hispanics agree that \"most can get ahead with hard work\"(among other Americans, the figure is 62 percent). Ruy Teixeira, who two decades ago co-authored the The Emerging Democratic Majority , observed last month that three-fifths of Latinos believe life will be better for the next generation, that most think America is \"a fair society where everyone has a chance to get ahead,\" and that, by more than 3 to 1, they'd \"rather be a citizen of the United States than any other country.\" As he put it, \"Clearly, this constituency does not harbor particularly radical views on the nature of American society and its supposed intrinsic racism and white supremacy.\"\n\nResults from a recent national AEI poll are similarly instructive . While just 58 percent of black Americans, 44 percent of Hispanics, and 42 percent of whites want schools to teach about \"white privilege,\" massive, broad-based majorities support teaching about the topics that are supposedly divisive. For instance, 74 percent of white Americans and 75 percent of black Americans \"favor teaching students that the dispute over slavery was the principal cause of the Civil War.\" Among Republicans and Democrats alike, more than 4 out of 5 say social studies textbooks should discuss that many Founders owned slaves, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, and the federal government's maltreatment of Native Americans. Ninety percent of the public thinks that schools should have students read \"works by a racially diverse set of authors.\" At the same time, 61 percent of respondents say that schools are not doing enough to teach students to love their country.\n\nIn short, the public is in a reasonable, inclusive place while CRT's toxic, illiberal, Marxist doctrines are wildly out of step with the values of most Americans-whatever their race or creed. Politico , for instance, interviewed left-leaning or moderate suburbanites in six states, five carried by Biden in 2020 and reports , \"They are up in arms over their school systems' new equity initiatives, which they argue are costly and divisive, encouraging students to group themselves by race and take pro-activist stances.\" Politico profiled one Michigan mom who got interested in CRT when her daughter started \"arguing that rioters who looted stores during 2020's Black Lives Matter protests were justified.\" She's slowly gotten involved in school board affairs and, while a lifelong Democrat, says, \"I cannot continue [voting for Democratic candidates] in good faith.\"\n\nThese issues hit parents where they live. They're about what values their kids are bringing home from school. Conservatives have the chance to defend shared values that resonate deeply with many who have not historically found themselves on the right. This creates an enormous opportunity for conservatism.\n\nUnfortunately, what should be a simple, principled pitch for conservatives- those guys are embracing a toxic, race-based assault on shared values and the liberal order while we believe in rationality, independent thought, and constitutional equality-has been undermined by right-wingers who have seemingly done what they can to inhabit left-wing caricatures.\n\nIn June, Moms for Liberty, a group that purports to stand up for parental rights at all levels of government, filed a complaint claiming that the \"Civil Rights Heroes\" module of Williamson County's second-grade curriculum violated Tennessee's new anti-CRT law . The source of the complaint? A picture book about Ruby Bridges and an second grade-level autobiography of the civil rights icon, a Penguin Young Reader book on Martin Luther King's March on Washington, and a picture book titled Separate Is Never Equal (complainants were particularly irate that the Ruby Bridges books noted that young Ruby had been harassed by crowds of angry white people). Hard to occupy the moral high ground while countenancing complaints like this.\n\nJust this week, it was reported that Utah's Davis School District, north of Salt Lake City, has ignored racial harassment for years. The Justice Department found that \"peers taunted Black students by making monkey noises at them, touching and pulling their hair without permission, repeatedly referencing slavery and lynching and telling Black students 'go pick cotton' and 'you are my slave.'\" Imagine being a black parent sending your child to such a school each day. Principled conservatives need to speak out against this disgrace with the same fury and frustration that they target on the excesses of CRT. That's an essential first step in reassuring black and brown parents that we have their children's needs at heart.\n\nIt also becomes more difficult to insist that the fight is about principle when prominent CRT critics are spending their time firing off tweets that say, \"We have successfully frozen their brand-'critical race theory'-into the public conversation and are steadily driving up negative perceptions\" or touting CRT as \"the perfect villain.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, it's tougher to find outrageous examples than one might expect. And some prominent Republicans have taken pains to sound some sensible notes. Former U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos has said , \"Of course we need to teach history. We need to teach about slavery\" and schools need curriculum that \"embraces all of the parts of our history.\" Sen. Ted Cruz tweeted , \"OF COURSE we should teach about slavery & racism.\"\n\nBut much more is needed. On issues as fraught as these, it's crucial to make a case that's principled, precise, and welcoming. Needless to say, that's not how these things tend to play out today. Indeed, the NPR and New York Times are eagerly waiting to insist that each untoward incident shows what's really in the conservative heart. Therein lies the challenge. And provisions in anti-CRT laws that seem intent on  \"banning\" particular topics or concepts, rather than restricting unconstitutional or illegal practices, don't help. Feeding the narrative that the right wants to ban discussions of slavery is not only wrong-headed but also a regrettable unforced error, given that Republicans overwhelmingly say they support teaching the very topics supposedly in dispute.\n\nThere's an extraordinary opportunity here if conservatives can clearly distinguish between blasting the toxic sludge that is CRT and embracing the deeply American ideal that every student should feel valued, welcome, and seen. After all, past all the arguments about test scores, virtual learning, and policy, parents want to know that schools are places where their children feel safe and affirmed, and are learning to respect the values that they hold dear.\n\nIt's not hard to imagine conservatives convincing patriotic black and brown parents who believe in the promise of America to make common cause against wild-eyed zealots who believe that America is a \"slavocracy\" (as the 1619 Project's Nikole Hannah-Jones puts it ) or that respect for \"hard work\" is a legacy of \"white supremacy culture\" (as KIPP charter schools have said). But it's impossible to imagine conservatives convincing those same parents to join a fight that seems marked by hostility to black and brown kids and families.\n\nFor decades, Democrats have enjoyed a sizable advantage on education, fueled by support for ever-more school spending and the perception that they like teachers more than Republicans do. Now, the progressive base has aggressively staked out radical, unpopular ground in an emotional debate, and establishment Democrats have decided not to triangulate off the craziness but to rally to the cause. This presents the right, as we've seen this fall in the Virginia gubernatorial contest, a remarkable opportunity to do well by doing good. But only if conservatives can seize it.\n\nFrederick M.

      "text": "How the Fight Over Critical Race Theory Became a Religious War\n\nThis is the wrong time to close Christian hearts and minds to challenging debates about race and justice in the United States.\n\nIn the late summer of 1991 I arrived at Harvard Law School a devout Evangelical, conservative Republican. I grew up in a small town in Kentucky, attended a private Christian college in Nashville, and then walked into an intellectual home for a new theory I'd never encountered: critical race theory.\n\nI remember reading the some of the key early texts, including Kimberle Crenshaw's seminal law review article , \"Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics,\" first published in 1989. I remember being assigned excerpts from Derrick Bell's book, Faces At The Bottom Of The Well: The Permanence Of Racism .\n\nI remember being both challenged and frustrated by CRT. There were elements that, even in the moment, were immediately enlightening, such as Crenshaw's discussion of the inability of contemporary antidiscrimination law to grapple with the nuances of \"intersecting\" identities.\n\nThere were also troubling elements, including a pervasive pessimism about the ability of America's classical liberal structures to achieve true racial equality and an unwillingness to acknowledge the extent of America's racial progress. In addition, some of CRT's most ardent adherents could be remarkably intolerant, sometimes even seeking to shout down competing ideas or suppress dissent.\n\nWhat I did not think, at any point, was that I was reading an idea fundamentally at odds with orthodox Christianity.\n\nIf you wonder why I raise such a thought, you're not following the grassroots debate about CRT closely enough. You don't understand the reason for its raw intensity. The Republican attack on CRT isn't just an attack on an academic idea. At the grassroots it's seen as a defense of Christianity itself. The origin of this belief, like everything related to CRT, is complicated. But its elements are simple enough to explain.\n\nThe process went like this:\n\nFirst, there was and is an interesting and highly technical academic and theological debate about the compatibility of Christianity and CRT, with a number of voices arguing that CRT clashed with the Christian faith.\n\nSecond, the definition of CRT was fundamentally and intentionally changed by conservative activists to encompass an enormous number of arguments and ideas about race, including arguments and ideas that have nothing to do with CRT.\n\nThird, the result is that large numbers of Christians who now hear unfamiliar or unpopular arguments about race not only think those ideas are \"CRT\" but also that they're positively unchristian and poisonous to their souls.\n\nLet's start with the theological debate. The thoughtful Christian argument against CRT boils down to the notion that it's, in essence, not so much an academic theory as an all-consuming worldview. As Christian writers and scholars Neil Shenvi and Pat Sawyer argued in an important piece in the The Gospel Coalition , critical theory (CRT is one aspect of critical theory)* purports to answer \"our most basic questions: Who are we? What is our fundamental problem? What is the solution to that problem? What is our primary moral duty? How should we live?\"\n\nThe authors contrasted what they described as the \"metanarratives\" of Christianity and critical theory. Christianity \"provides us with an overarching metanarrative that runs from creation to redemption,\" whereas \"critical theory is associated with a metanarrative that runs from oppression to liberation.\"\n\nWhile the essay doesn't claim that everything critical theory affirms as false, it asserts that the Christianity and critical theory's \"respective metanarratives will vie for dominance in all areas of life.\" How does this work? Shenvi and Sawyer ask us to consider the question of identity: \"Is our identity primarily defined in terms of our vertical relationship to God? Or primarily in terms of horizontal power dynamics between groups of people?\"\n\nOr consider the question of sin and guilt. Here again Shenvi and Sawyer contrast Christianity with their perception of critical theory: \"Is our fundamental problem sin , in which case we all equally stand condemned before a holy God? Or is our fundamental problem oppression , in which case members of dominant groups are tainted by guilt in a way that members of subordinate groups are not?\" (Emphasis in the original.)\n\nAll of this is nuanced and debatable. Christian defenders of CRT would note, for example, that when you're talking about oppression, you are talking about sin. And while members of dominant groups don't have personal guilt for the actions of their ancestors and predecessors, there is a shared responsibility to ameliorate the effects of injustice.\n\nMoreover, biblical commands to \"act justly\" require us to consider not just our vertical relationship with God but also our horizontal relationships with our neighbors, including those neighbors who face the consequences of systemic sin and oppression. In other words, our vertical relationship with God creates horizontal obligations, and there are ways in which CRT's historical and legal analyses can help us better understand our nation and our culture.\n\nFor example, I'd urge you to read Crenshaw's law review article with an open mind. She analyzes three employment discrimination cases to make the argument that federal civil rights law should recognize that \"black women\" can experience discrimination that is distinct from the discrimination experienced by black men and by white women. It's a fascinating and highly technical legal argument, and it's hard to even conceive of how it could be unchristian.\n\nBut one doesn't have to get quite as theological as Shenvi and Sawyer to argue about the religious implications of CRT. In an influential 2018 Atlantic article , John McWhorter argued persuasively that elements of secular modern anti-racism (which can often draw on CRT themes and arguments) looked a lot like a religion.\n\nWhite privilege, he argued, is in this view akin to original sin. \"The idea of a someday when America will 'come to terms with race' is as vaguely specified a guidepost as Judgment Day.\" Declaring speech \"problematic\" is similar to declaring it heretical or blasphemous. And \"virtue signaling\" is roughly analogous to an \"aggressive display\" of faith in Jesus.\n\nI've also argued that extreme manifestations of CRT can clash with Christian orthodoxy . There's a certain irony in CRT. It argues that race is a social construct (a valuable insight and a concept entirely consistent with Christian thought) yet also sometimes places that social construction at the center of individual identity, as the primary lens through which you view your place in the world.\n\nAgain, all of this is complicated, and a true critical theorist would read Shenvi, Sawyer, McWhorter, or me and object on any number of points. Indeed, what even is a \"true\" critical theorist when the concept includes branching lines of thought, with real debate and disagreement between different scholars?\n\nIn June 2019, the Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's largest Protestant denomination, entered the debate. It enacted a common-sense resolution that argued that CRT had uses and limits.\n\nThe resolution, called Resolution 9, noted that Evangelical scholars have \"employed selective insights from critical race theory and intersectionality to understand multifaceted social dynamics\" and that one could gain \"truthful insights found in human ideas that do not explicitly emerge from Scripture.\"\n\nIn other words, CRT had use as an \"analytical tool\" which could assist in understanding our world, yet that analytical tool is \"subordinate to scripture,\" and the \"gospel of Jesus Christ alone grants the power to change people and society.\"\n\nResolution 9 reflected the ethos of the less fundamentalist branch of the Evangelical movement. This wing of American Christianity is more apt to seek knowledge and insight about the world from secular sources, taking ideas from psychology, sociology, and critical theory to help understand complex cultural, political, and historical questions.\n\nThat's hardly the universal Christian approach, and more fundamentalist Christians have long looked askance at the social sciences (including each discipline above) and are more apt to argue that the solution to the race problem in America is found in the Bible alone.\n\nSo far, however, everything I've explained has been the stuff of panel discussions and competing essays. It's a niche argument for a relatively niche audience. All that changed last year, however. Last summer CRT became central to the national conversation-with interest spiking far beyond even the days and weeks following George Floyd's murder and the resulting \"national conversation\" about race. Google Trends searches of \"critical race theory\" tell the tale:\n\nSo what happened? As with any culturally significant moment, there are multiple explanations. The explosion of interest in CRT is certainly part of the conservative response to the so-called \" Great Awokening ,\" the increasing racial radicalization of white progressives, to the point where white liberals' perspectives on race moved to the left even of black Democrats.\n\nThis radical left turn sometimes veered into the kind of religious intensity that McWhorter identified above. This zeal contained a deeply intolerant strain that manifested in an extraordinary wave of cancellations that alarmed not just conservatives, but many liberals as well.\n\nBut conservative alarm wasn't simply organic. Opportunistic activists like James Lindsay and Manhattan Institute senior fellow Christopher Rufo intentionally and explicitly redefined CRT. Here's Rufo in a tweet thread with Lindsay:\n\nWe have successfully frozen their brand-\"critical race theory-into the public conversation and are steadily driving up negative perceptions. We will eventually turn it toxic, as we put all of the various cultural insanities under that brand category. The goal is to have the public read something crazy in the newspaper and immediately think \"critical race theory.\" We have decodified the term and will recodify it to annex the entire range of cultural constructions that are unpopular with Americans.\n\nHe proceeded to be as good as his word, and now the right-wing conversation about CRT is all but useless. Consider, for example, the so-called \"anti-CRT\" bills that are flooding out of red-state legislatures. They ban ideas that sweep far beyond any reasonable definition of CRT . No critical race theorist worth his or her salt would read Tennessee's anti-CRT bill and think for a moment that the legislature captured the essence of the theory.\n\nAnti-CRT speech codes are problematic on their own terms, for reasons I've explained at length -including that the plain text Tennessee's law even limits instruction about some of Martin Luther King Jr.'s writings -but the mass-branding of \"unpopular\" racial ideas as \"CRT\" has much more pernicious effects when combined with the argument that CRT is unchristian. It closes Christian minds to challenging thoughts and ideas, and it incentivizes a relentless effort within Christian communities to suppress conversations with people who are perceived to be \"woke.\"\n\nTo take one example, Grove City College, a conservative Christian college in Pennsylvania, has endured a storm of controversy over alleged \"mission drift.\" Hundreds of students, parents, and alumni signed a petition against CRT at the school :\n\nThe petition cited as evidence of CRT \"asserting itself at GCC\" a fall 2020 chapel presentation by Jemar Tisby, a historian and author who writes on race and religion; a chapel that included a pre-recorded TED talk by Bryan Stevenson, an Equal Justice Initiative founder and criminal justice reform advocate; a Resident Assistant training that included the concepts of white privilege and white guilt; and several books used in an education studies class and in focus groups, including Ibram X. Kendi's \"How to be an Antiracist\" and Wheaton professor Esau McCaulley's \"Reading While Black.\"\n\nThe petition makes little sense if one thinks of one role of a college-including a Christian college-as exposing students to competing ideas and theories about race. It makes far more sense if you're convinced that CRT is a threat to American Christianity. In that context even the very few listed examples of alleged CRT can't be permitted at the school.\n\nThere's an entire cottage industry of Christian voices who relentlessly police American evangelicalism for evidence of \"wokeism\" or \"CRT,\" and the definition of both concepts is almost impossibly broad. Do you believe systemic racism exists? That's CRT. Do you believe in institutional responsibility to correct the consequences of historic oppression? That's CRT.\n\nImmense damage is being done. Centuries of American racism warped and distorted our society in countless ways. And while we've made tremendous progress in creating a more just society, the effects of slavery and Jim Crow-and the lingering reality of existing racism-present our nation (and the church) with a profound and complicated challenge.\n\nThis is the exact wrong time to close Christian hearts and minds to thoughtful voices, including thoughtful voices who offer new approaches to our understandings of race and justice in the United States. You don't have to agree. You can and should dissent when you sincerely believe ideas are wrong. But when activists shout \"CRT\" about ideas they don't like, they're not defending the faith, they're often trying to block you from perspectives that Christian believers need to hear.\n\nOne more thing ...\n\nAfter an avalanche of thoughtful listener comments about fundamentalism, Curtis and I returned to the topic in this week's Good Faith podcast . And this time we paid close to attention to how fundamentalism forms. It's a great discussion about how our human nature can push us towards intolerance, especially when we surround ourselves with people of like mind.\n\nOne last thing ...\n\nA friend sent this to me, and I thought it was incredibly touching. On the streets of one of the most secular cities in the world, Ukrainian Christians sang a prayer for their country. Their expression of faith and hope inspired me, and I hope it inspires you:\n\nCorrection, April 10: I originally identified Shenvi and Sawyer's Gospel Coalition essay as specifically addressing \"CRT.\" It addresses \"critical theory,\" a broader concept that encompasses CRT but also other forms of critical social theories, including theories addressing gender and sexuality. I apologize for the error.\n\nDavid French is a columnist for the New York Times. He's a former senior editor of The Dispatch.

      "text": "How Both Sides Distort the Debate Over Critical Race Theory\n\nCritics exaggerate what it entails and how it's being taught. But supporters use it as a cudgel to accuse people of racism.\n\nPut aside what you may have heard-pro or con-about terms such as systemic racism or critical race theory (CRT) for a moment. There's a lot of exaggeration out there among both defenders and critics.\n\nInstead, let me tell you a story.\n\nAfter the civil rights movement achieved its legislative goals in the 1960s, formal, legal racism was largely abolished. Yes, there was cleanup work to do in various states. But broadly speaking, deliberate discrimination was no longer protected by the law. There was still cultural racism, of course-and there still is. But looking at the big picture, the tumor of deliberate racism has shrunk on a staggering scale.\n\nThis was the result of a massive legal, social, and educational effort. And it was a huge success that all Americans should take pride in. Racism isn't an American phenomenon; it's a human one that exists everywhere. But few societies have worked as hard to battle it as the United States has over the last half-century.\n\nAnd yet, disparities persist. Black Americans comprise 13 percent of the population but fall short of that percentage in a number of important areas-the ranks of affluent, the college educated, and a large number of professions we normally associate with affluence and education.\n\nCRT, structural racism, institutional racism, etc., represent efforts to explain why.\n\nIt's no accident that law schools and lawyers were at the vanguard. If you wanted to sue a business or agency for \"disparate impacts\"-e.g., the underrepresentation of minorities in certain jobs or unequal lending by banks-you needed to show that these disparities were the result of deliberately bigoted policies. The problem: Evidence of the disparities remained abundant while evidence of racist intent largely vanished.\n\nEnter critical race theory, which looks for systemic problems that perpetuate disparities even when no one in power intends them. These structural policies could be legacies of decisions made long ago that had racist intent behind them, or they could simply be the unintended consequences of rules people thought were neutral.\n\nFor instance, in 2018, 1,197 people in America received a Ph.D. in economics. Of those, 18 were black. I'm skeptical that attributing this underrepresentation to deliberate racism is a suitable explanation. Universities are almost as desperate to diversify their faculties as they are to diversify their student bodies. But the underrepresentation exists all the same. And it's worth asking: Why?\n\nI won't try to answer the question here, but reasonable people can point to any number of plausible explanations. One involves systemic problems in the larger culture. And some of those problems have to do with the legacy of racism, slavery, and Jim Crow. We can differ on how much weight to give those factors.\n\nIt's also worth considering whether such underrepresentation is necessarily that big a problem. On one level, disparities by race, gender, religion and other categories have to do with individual choices. Nearly 84 percent of doctors specializing in obstetrics and gynecology are women, and roughly the same share of orthopedic surgeons are men. It's not crazy to think this is largely the result of individual choices by individual women and only seems like a problem if you think the percentage should be perfectly proportionate to the share of women in the population. Forcing women into professions they don't want to enter doesn't strike me as a feminist victory.\n\nNone of this is to say that all is fine for blacks in America. Black poverty rates are a serious problem, as are disparities in wealth and education. To the extent that critical race theory looks for explanations and remedies to these problems, there's nothing to object to as far as I can tell. I might disagree with the explanations and the remedies some theorists propose, but I'm at a loss to understand why the effort to find them is anything but laudable.\n\nHere's the problem: The stuff passing itself off as CRT in the national debate isn't really that. An academic tool invented to help explain why racial problems endure even when conscious racism is no longer pervasive has morphed into a cudgel to accuse people of racism if they don't agree with the proposed diagnosis or the cure.\n\nDefenders of CRT are often right when they say opponents are distorting what it means. But those same people often pretend that America hasn't made enormous strides in fighting racism and claim that racism today remains the only explanation for the problems created by racism of the past.\n\nJonah Goldberg is editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Dispatch, based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "The Fight Over Critical Race Theory Is Only a Short-Term Gift to the GOP\n\nAnd it could be harmful in the long run.\n\nIt feels like yesterday that my wife and I were shopping for grade schools for our daughter-the same daughter who just graduated from high school.\n\nWe visited a bunch of private schools where the children of Washington's elite get turned into the feedstock of the meritocracy.\n\nThe most remarkable thing about the experience was how nearly all of the schools were obsessed with \"diversity\"-and all the pedagogic and social issues attached to the term. Many pitched diversity not merely as important but as their sole comparative advantage. It was as though they thought if they could convince us that they cared more about diversity than their competitors, that alone would seal the deal.\n\nThe headmaster of one prestigious school even advised a group of parents to look at the mission statements of other schools. \"You'll see a lot of buzzwords like 'academic rigor' and 'scholarship,'\" he warned, making scare quotes with his fingers. \"Well, we want you to know that we consider our social justice mission more important than academics.\"\n\nI often tell this story to point out that school choice isn't the solution to political correctness that many conservatives think it is. Parents who can afford to send their kids to private schools don't need vouchers; they've got cash. In Washington, New York, and other big cities, the ideological climate of private schools is often more \"woke\" than in the public schools.\n\nBut I'm bringing this up for different reasons.\n\nProponents of \"critical race theory\" and \"anti-racism\" (the idea that being \"nonracist\" isn't good enough; you have to embrace an antiracist agenda) as an approach to classroom instruction believe America is shot through with structural racism and white supremacy-and that white people must atone for their \"privilege\" somehow.\n\nTaking this approach, they claim, will usher in a long-overdue reckoning with our past and present. They make it sound as if before 2021, it never occurred to anyone that kids should be taught about racism or the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow.\n\n\"Currently, most k-12 students already learn a kind of Confederate Race Theory, whereby the Daughters of the Confederacy long ago imposed a version of history wherein slavery was not so bad and had nothing to do with the civil war, and lynchings and violence never happened,\" MSNBC host Joy-Ann Reid recently tweeted .\n\nWell, I can report that this is otherworldly nonsense, going by my daughter's experience or that of the children of people I know in Washington (or New York or Los Angeles). At affluent K-12 schools, public or private-where the purported greatest beneficiaries of \"white privilege\" send their own children-teaching about racism, slavery and civil rights has been central to social studies curricula for decades.\n\nBut you know what? This has also been the case at most non-elite schools. Sure, there are school districts that are outliers, but the idea that, absent a critical-race-theory lens, most students would be taught American history through the prism of Gone With the Wind or The Birth of a Nation is preposterous. Thankfully, that's not the world we live in.\n\nAnd parents know it. Which is why the debate over this new political hobby horse has people talking past each other.\n\nComparisons to the Tea Party protests of 2009 are imperfect but instructive. For liberals, the protests ignited by Barack Obama's stimulus package seemed illegitimate. For some, it was a racist backlash against a black president. For others, it was a fake movement fueled by \"astroturfing\" political grifters. (The grifters eventually took it over, but that came later.) And some saw it as hypocritical. George W. Bush had his bank and auto industry bailouts, and conservatives went along. Why rediscover fiscal restraint now?\n\nBut for increasingly populist conservatives at that time, more government spending by any administration was a last straw.\n\nWhen proponents of critical race theory say they are merely proposing a belated corrective to the way American history has been framed, many parents don't buy it, having seen what their children are taught now.\n\nThe current battle over critical race theory is a wonderful gift to the Republicans in the short term. The GOP would love to win back white suburban parents with culture-war issues, now that it has no credibility on fiscal matters. But in the long run, this could be disastrous for the party and the country, because the last thing anyone needs is to redefine the culture war as a racial conflict.\n\nJonah Goldberg is editor-in-chief and co-founder of The Dispatch, based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "Open the Books on Critical Race Theory\n\nThere should be nothing controversial about transparency rules that allow parents to see what their kids are being taught in school.\n\nIt's no surprise that parents are outraged at public schools teaching \"critical race theory\" (CRT)-or whatever term one prefers for the fashionable notions that America is systemically racist and that the solution is to treat people differently based on skin color. Taxpayers, after all, typically expect the schools they pay for to teach kids history, science, literature, and math-not to indoctrinate them into false and destructive political dogmas.\n\nMany school bureaucrats deny that these notions are being taught in classrooms, but they are. Former teacher Kali Fontanilla-to cite just one example- recently revealed how schools in her home state of California are \"hyper race-focused,\" with social science classes centered around teaching that \"America was built to only help the white man.\" Curricula rooted in CRT dispense with historical fact s, and aim instead at instructing black students that capitalism, private property rights, the constitutional rule of law, and other elements of American democracy are inherently biased against them, so that nothing short of a radical overhaul of government and culture can enable them to succeed. White students, on the other hand, are taught that whatever success their families have attained is merely a consequence of undeserved \"privilege,\" for which they must atone. (As for Asian students, they're effectively ignored .)\n\nDetroit Schools Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said at a board of education meeting last fall, \"our curriculum is deeply using critical race theory,\" not just in history and social science, but in \"the other disciplines,\" and that the effort was \"intentional.\" That only makes sense: It's hard to see how an English teacher's lesson plan would be unaffected by the notion that \"worship of the written word\" is \"characteristic of white supremacy,\" or how a science instructor could teach physics if she believes \" either/or thinking \" and \" objectivity \" are racist.\n\nThe sad truth is that these ideas are themselves both racist and debilitating. They're racist because they presume-indeed, overtly declare-either that all white people believe or act in certain ways, or that virtues such as objectivity and professionalism are by definition white characteristics. And they're debilitating because they lead students to conclude that the cultural and social patterns arising from such concepts as individual rights or the rule of law are inevitably oppressive. Simply put, the most important part of the CRT formula is the word systemic . When America is alleged to be systemically racist, the system in question is capitalist liberalism, if not Western civilization itself. Overturning that \"system\" is CRT's imperative.\n\nThe consequence of teaching this in schools is to inculcate in pupils either a sense of helpless despair or bitter and dangerous resentment against a target described vaguely enough that political leaders can train it against whatever they want. In 1946, psychologist Viktor Frankl warned against what he called \"learned meaninglessness,\" resulting from the \"nihilism transmitted on many an academic campus,\" which can either sap a student's will to achieve or boil over into violent rage that demagogues can harness to their will. But Frederick Douglass beat Frankl to it by half a century, when he denounced black politicians who argued that America was so hopelessly racist that black Americans should emigrate to Africa. Such \"nonsense,\" he warned,\n\ntends to throw over the negro a mantle of despair. It leads him to doubt the possibility of his progress as an American citizen.... Its tendency is to make him despondent and doubtful, where he should be made to feel assured and confident. It forces upon him the idea that he is forever doomed to be a stranger and a sojourner in the land of his birth.... With such ideas constantly flaunted before him, he cannot easily set himself to work to better his condition in such ways as are open to him here.\n\nCRT's grip on public schools has not only sparked understandable fury, but has also inspired efforts by state lawmakers to rein in such propagandizing. There's no doubt that legislators can do this-courts have ruled that \"the First Amendment does not protect primary and secondary school teachers' in-class curricular speech\"-but there is a legitimate debate over how this is best done. David French and others have warned that if such anti-CRT bills are written in vague terms, they risk stifling legitimate educational goals, and that's true. Oklahoma's recently adopted HB 1775 prohibits teachers from \"mak[ing] part of a course\" the \"concept\" that \"one race or sex is inherently superior to another,\" which could arguably forbid everything from Shakespeare to the novels of Zora Neale Hurston. On the other hand, a proposal such as Alaska's HB 343 , which prohibits officials from \"compelling a school employee to affirm ... that an individual, by virtue of their sex, race, ethnicity...[etc.] is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive,\" is not only narrow enough to pass constitutional muster, but would impose a common-sense limit on how public servants use their power and our money.\n\nBut whatever one thinks of that debate, there is an alternative: transparency. Public schools are creatures of the state, and parents have a right to know what is being taught to their children. Allowing them to examine the teaching materials used in classrooms-CRT-related or otherwise-helps parents to know how their public schools are operating, and empowers them to make better choices, not only about whether to speak up at school board meetings, but about other things: whether to hire a tutor, for example, or whether to have a family discussion about a sensitive subject being addressed in a class. Transparency encourages the kind of involved parenting teachers often claim to want.\n\nEfforts are now underway in 24 states to require public schools to make publicly available a list of the books, videos, or other materials that teachers present to students. These requirements are minimally invasive-a simple list of the materials (disclosing the title, author, and/or internet link for each) posted on a website would typically suffice, and teachers could still introduce new items at the last minute, as long as they promptly update the disclosure list. Yet CRT proponents have attacked the very concept of transparency, claiming that it will stifle classroom discussions. The ACLU, for example-which used to be a prominent defender of government transparency, and still has a section on its website devoted to the subject-issued a statement condemning these proposals for \"chilling\" free speech in the classroom. The leftist PEN America has called them downright \"censorious.\"\n\nThese accusations are obviously absurd: For one thing, transparency doesn't mean schools can't teach sensitive topics. When a group in Tennessee objected to a lesson plan that taught Ruby Bridges Goes to School: My True Story and Martin Luther King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech, the state's education board rejected the complaint, and rightly so. But more importantly, teachers employed by the government have no constitutional right to tell students whatever they wish; they're required to obey curriculum rules set by local and state laws. Parents, by contrast, do have a fundamental constitutional right to oversee their children's upbringing. Only someone who thinks schools exist to rescue kids from their own parents could object-as the 1619 Project's Nikole Hannah-Jones recently did -to \"the idea that parents should decide what's being taught.\"\n\nCRT proponents do, in fact, think that. CRT is an activist mindset, not a scholarly theory-as education expert Jonathan Butcher recently observed , it's \"meant to be applied ... it's not just an idea; it's effectively a verb.\" Its principal aim is to take white kids from their inevitably racist households and transform them into new, more \"woke\" citizens, while conscripting black students into cultural and political activism-and even violence . A century ago, the progressive President Woodrow Wilson said that the ideal school would \"make a son as unlike his father as possible,\" and while today's progressives would eschew Wilson's gendered language, they still embrace his sentiment. Most parents, however, would prefer schools to equip students with the knowledge necessary to pursue their own happiness, rather than propagating historical falsehoods to recruit kids into a radical political movement. That's why CRT advocates such as Hannah-Jones view transparency requirements as a threat. Actual scholars propounding genuine scholarly theories typically welcome publicity and discussion. But publicity is the last thing CRT's partisans want.\n\nOf course, there are some parents who would prefer that their children's education emphasize CRT or multiculturalist ideas-and transparency requirements would help these parents, too, since it would enable them to decide whether their public schools are devoting sufficient time to these doctrines; if not, they could choose schools such as the New Concept Development Center , the Sovereign Community School , or the Social Justice School . But that's not enough to satisfy CRT activists, who view themselves on a mission to fundamentally alter the American nation. The easiest way to do that is to change public school curricula into taxpayer-funded propaganda, with as little oversight from parents as possible.\n\nWhen it's convenient to do so, the left claims that democracy dies in darkness. But when it comes to CRT, they prefer to keep such matters from parents. That's doubtless because they know their doctrines are extraordinarily unpopular, even among non-whites , and that if given the choice, parents would rather their kids be taught that whatever cruelties their ancestors suffered, and whatever obstacles they themselves may face, they can rise through objectivity, professionalism, determination, and other virtues. That, after all, is the truth.\n\nTimothy Sandefur is vice president for litigation at the Goldwater Institute, which has authored the academic transparency legislation discussed in this article.\n\nTimothy Sandefur is vice president for legal affairs at the Goldwater Institute.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

This summer, the U.S. Senate approved an amendment to the budget reconciliation bill that would ban federal funding for the teaching of CRT in schools.\n\nThe 2016 version says students will use \"critical race theory (as well as mixed-methods research techniques) as a means of studying issues such as teacher quality, education policy, and race and social justice in education.\" The 2021 version simply mentions \"mixed-methods research techniques.\"\n\nA new sentence may be intended to surreptitiously refer to CRT: \"During this institute, fellows study the sociocultural contexts of American schooling and learn how to formulate culturally competent research questions.\"\n\nThe two applications otherwise barely changed, mainly to reflect different participating institutions, according to a web page comparison engine . For example, \"Latino/a\" remains in both even though the gender-neutral \"Latinx\" is now standard in higher ed and was already common in 2016 .\n\nNorth Carolina Central University runs the program, which has now received more than $2.6 million in taxpayer dollars across the two five-year grants. RISE \"strongly encourage[s]\" underrepresented minority students - which typically means non-Asian nonwhites - to apply.\n\nStudents get a $6,000 stipend and up to $900 for research-related expenses, among other perks. The 2021 award from taxpayers was more than $400,000 greater even though it serves two fewer students.\n\nThe RISE page on the historically black institution's website still specifies CRT is core to the program, even though it otherwise aligns with the 2021 application, including the expanded participant list and new coprincipal investigators.\n\nWhile the renewed grant was announced this summer, the removal of \"critical race theory\" doesn't appear to have been publicized until The Center Square newswire referred to the wording change in a post-Thanksgiving report.\n\nThe university didn't tell Just the News whether it was aware of the discrepancy between the 2021 grant application and its depiction of the program, and whether the omission of CRT is benign or misrepresents RISE.\n\nSpokesperson Kia Bell provided a statement Dec. 2 that said its description was just \"a summary\" from the full application, which specifies that \"theories - including but not limited to critical race theory - will be explored.\"\n\n\"[I]t is essential to conduct research from the perspective of those under study,\" in this case African American and Latino/a students, the statement says. \"Having frameworks - including but not limited to cultural competence and critical race theory - facilitates the data collection and analyses processes in a way that facilitates the understanding of the impact of systems, in this case, the education system, on marginalized communities from their perspective.\"\n\nEven though the statement emphasizes \"theories,\" it concludes by noting critical race theory is the perspective through which RISE students analyze issues affecting minorities in education.\n\nNCCU has actually omitted the phrase \"critical race theory\" from the flyers it promoted to students interested in the RISE program in various years.\n\nThe 2017 , 2018 and 2020 flyers don't mention any variation of \"critical,\" but all refer to \"social equity,\" another possible euphemism. So does the 2021 flyer . (Just the News couldn't find a 2019 flyer.)\n\nThe wording change hasn't been consistent across or even within institutions participating with NCCU.\n\nThe University of New Mexico, a \"collaborating\" institution, described the June 2020 program as encompassing CRT on an events page but not a flyer . CRT is also missing from the flyer for next year's program .\n\nPennsylvania State University, which replaced the University of North Carolina Wilmington as the official \"partner\" in this application, used the academic word \"critical\" three times in a press release on the grant this summer.\n\nParticipating students will be provided with \"experiences in conducting critical, mixed-methods education research, year-round mentorship and support in preparing for doctoral study,\" it said.\n\n\"This program is designed to prepare the next generation of critical education researchers to tackle some of the country's most pressing challenges related to access and equity for Black and Latinx students,\" said Royel Johnson, coprincipal investigator. He'll teach a RISE course on \"critical theoretical frameworks.\"\n\nPrincipal investigator Wynetta Lee of NCCU, the onetime dean of its education school, didn't respond to queries. Neither did Penn State's Johnson or the other coprincipal investigator, Nina Smith of NCCU."

The Black poverty rate of 18.8 percent was the lowest it has been since 1959 when poverty estimates were first recorded for this group.\n\nIn 2019, the poverty rate for Hispanics, 15.7 percent, was also the lowest on record since data for this group was first recorded in 1972. The poverty rate for Asians was also the lowest on record of 7.3 percent. The poverty rate of 7.3 percent for non-Hispanic Whites in 2019 was the same as the poverty rate of 7.3 percent in 1973.\n\nThe dream of reaching middle class and suburbia also substantially improved in recent years.\n\nAfrican Americans now make up 12 percent of the middle class and 13 percent of the population. To put that in perspective, 84 percent of the middle class in 1979 was white, nine percent was Black, five percent Hispanic, and two percent \"other.\"\n\nBy 2019, whites had fallen to 59 percent of the middle class, while 12 percent was Black, 18 percent was Hispanic, and 10 percent was listed as \"other.\"\n\nAnother Brookings analysis found that Black household median incomes also increased. In 2018 Black household median income was $41,511 compared to a 2007 pre-recession peak of $41,134. Income increases in this group were also geographically widespread. Among the 50 metropolitan areas with the largest black populations, 18 saw a statistically significant increase in black median household income between 2013 and 2018.\n\nCensus data also indicates that the real median income among African Americans grew by 7.9 percent in 2019, outpacing 2018's income growth of 2.6 percent and 2017's income decline of 2.4 percent. Black median income growth in 2019 under former President Donald Trump surpassed income growth rates under previous administrations.\n\nKen Blackwell, a former mayor, state treasurer and Ohio Secretary of State, told Just The News that black families want public safety, quality education and the ability to work and be self-sufficient.\n\n\"That's what most black folks in this country want, because that's what most Americans want. They're not locked into this battle of ethnicity, ethnic groups or racial groups. They want to be part of an opportunity society,\" he said. \"And when you see leaders, political leaders in our cities, choosing not to make our cities fields of dreams, but because they are talking about defunding the police. They're talking about racial and ethnic division. They're turning our cities into killing fields not fields with dreams, and people are going to start pushing back against that.\"\n\nRaynard Jackson, founder of Black Americans for a Better Future, who has been working with black entrepreneurs nationwide, told Just The News, that at his events hundreds of young black, Asian, and Hispanic individuals are looking for business opportunities, not government handouts. \"We need to get more of these corporate executive to talk about business opportunities within Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Booz Allen SAIC\" to attract a younger generation, he said. \"We just want to be treated like a part of the team. And we're looking for opportunity to expand our businesses.\"\n\nHe also said blacks in his network are vehemently opposed to so-called Critical Race Theory. \"We're vehemently against this whole notion that you're going to tell a five-year-old black kid that his classmate and a five-year-old white kid is superior to you strictly because of the color of his skin when he came out of his mother's womb. That's crazy. You're poisoning the mind of pure, innocent kids and black parents, specifically, are vehemently against it. I cannot tell you the level of hostility they have to that notion.\"\n\nAccording to a RedFin survey that analyzed U.S. Census data and its own housing market data, Redfin found that people of color accounted for 28 percent of suburban populations nationwide in 2018, an increase of nearly two percent from 2010.\n\nThe biggest increase in suburban areas analyzed was in Las Vegas, where people of color accounted for 40.2 percent of its suburban population in 2018, up from 30.5 percent in 2010, the report found. Salt Lake City and Seattle suburbs saw the next largest increases.\n\nSuburbs of major cities nationwide also increased in ethnic diversity, including outside of Atlanta, Birmingham, Cincinnati, Dallas, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Phoenix.\n\nOne factor contributing to an increase in people of color moving to suburbs is the cost of living in cities became prohibitive, Redfin notes.\n\nRedfin chief economist Daryl Fairweather notes \"there's an important distinction between suburbs close to cities and those farther away. When Americans who are priced out of big cities move for more affordable housing, they tend to settle in nearby suburbs where they can still enjoy urban amenities.\n\n\"As many big coastal cities have grown too expensive for most Americans, people are spilling out into areas further away from city centers in search of affordable housing, resulting in more dense and more diverse suburban neighborhoods. The sprawl has changed some suburbs from bedroom communities into mini cities, with walkable restaurants and shops, and it's changed the way we think about suburbs. Living near the center of a city is no longer so important, especially with the surge in remote work since the pandemic began.\"\n\nAnother trend noted by the Census Bureau in its 2013-2017 American Community Survey five-year estimates, found that segregation by race and ethnicity had also declined since 2000.\n\nAmong 51 metro areas analyzed, 45 metro areas saw a decline among black-white segregation since 2000. While the majority saw reductions of only 1 to 4 percent, 16 areas saw declines of 5 percent or more.\n\nDetroit saw the greatest decline of nearly 12 percentage points, followed by the metro areas of Kansas City, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Chicago, Buffalo, Cleveland, and Minneapolis in the Midwest region. In Southern and Western metro areas, noticeable drops in segregation were found in Tampa, Louisville, Orlando, Houston, Memphis, Atlanta, New Orleans, and Miami. Segregation by race declined even though in some of these areas black populations increased both in metro and suburban areas.\n\nIn the largest 100 metro areas analyzed, Blacks accounted for 52 percent of neighborhood populations in 2000 compared to 45 percent from 2013-2017."

      "text": "Critical Race Theory is the new segregation across schools nationwide\n\nSince the public became aware of critical race theory a few years ago, it's subverted almost every aspect of America's fabric.\n\nIn operative terms, CRT, a neo-Marxist dogma, reduces every interaction between individuals into a collectivist conflict, between the oppressor race (the guilty villain) and oppressed race (the righteous victim).\n\nAnd the kids are not well.\n\nCRT is not just a war on kids - it's actually a war on the entire Western civilization as characterized by the Enlightenment values of individual agency and freedom.\n\nEven at the Department of Defense's K-12 schools for the children of US service members, CRT indoctrination was found to be so divisive and toxic that the organization responsible for it, the Education Activity Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion , was shut down - though this indoctrination remains in use, and the DEI office was caught last month reincarnated as the DEI \"Steering Committee.\"\n\nThe collectivist race reductionism of CRT indoctrinates kids - even young ones still \"reading\" picture books - to despise all whites as privileged oppressors and rally to all blacks as helpless victims.\n\nBeginning in full force next year in California but already introduced in some locations, for example, the state's recently mandated Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum instructs kids that they belong to either the oppressor group or the victim group, due only to their individual race.\n\nFormer young friends of different races now can only regard each other with suspicion, if not hostility. CRT creates sullen racist kids from nothing.\n\nAnd now we see CRT fueling antisemitic eruptions in schools from Berkeley, Oakland and San Francisco in California to New York, Boston, Washington and Philadelphia on the East Coast - because CRT's race essentialism pits \"indigenous\" people against \"settlers\" just as easily as it pits blacks against whites, with course modules indoctrinating the fake history that Palestine was conquered by invading Jews over the backs of Muslim indigenous people.\n\nDon't be lulled that \"ethnic\" means inclusion and acceptance - Manuel Rustin, who helped draft California's curriculum, stated, \"Ethnic studies without critical race theory is not ethnic studies.\"\n\nCRT says individuals cast into the oppressed class can do nothing about their condition.\n\nSo forget achievement, delayed gratification, belief in progress, punctuality, meritocracy, the written word, math and science - they are all \"whiteness.\"\n\nCRT replaces agency in kids by learned helplessness.\n\nAccording to activist Ibram Kendi, who's made a career off this, oppression is never a question of whether, but how, so kids are taught to find oppression in every interaction, even when it is microscopic or nonexistent - which means CRT implicitly promotes exaggeration and fabrication.\n\nSo CRT teaches kids facts don't matter, only \"your truth\" of \"feeling safe\" and \"lived experience\" - all unchallengeable.\n\nCRT replaces fortitude against adversity by fragility to imagined slights.\n\nYou'd think the mental-health profession would intervene, but it, like education, has been taken over by CRT and is making things even worse.\n\nSoviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn vividly portrayed how communists diagnosed dissidents as mentally ill, thus weaponizing psychiatry.\n\nToday, CRT in America uses \"social-emotional learning\" on already fragilized kids to manipulate them into further docility to CRT.\n\nIf you object to anything, you're the one who is wrong.\n\nStay up on the very latest with Evening Update.\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nBecause everything is racism under CRT, disparate outcomes by race can only come from racism and must be eradicated.\n\nThis is called \"equity,\" a marketing name for CRT, which says that because blacks underperform whites and Asians (and increasingly Hispanics) in school, racism is the cause and academics must be dumbed down.\n\nThis happens in multitudes of ways.\n\nFirst, inflate grades into meaninglessness: not just general grade inflation, but racially targeted grade inflation, on top of outright grade fraud.\n\nNext, dumb down the curriculum.\n\nBan algebra from middle schools and calculus from high schools!\n\nNo exaggeration - it's happening from California to New York, despite opposition from parents and brave educators, despite obvious damage to America's national security and prosperity.\n\nTheir replacements are hollowed-out, easy-to-ace courses infused with CRT indoctrination, like faux data science and \"culturally responsive\" ethnic studies .\n\nCourses that haven't been purged are also quietly dumbed down, infused again with CRT indoctrination, not just in math and science but across all areas; professors confide that they can no longer teach at the same level as 10 years ago.\n\nFinally, replace meritocratic admissions to better colleges, magnet schools, gifted and talented and other academic acceleration programs by procedures incorporating one or more of \"top percent\" schemes like Gov. Hochul's \"top 10% plan\" for the State University of New York, lotteries like that used by the New York City Department of Education and set-asides like New York state's Science and Technology Entry Program.\n\nThe goal is to favor those less academically deserving but more likely to be of the \"victim\" race over those more academically deserving but more likely to be of the \"oppressor\" race: This not only enables those institutions and programs to dumb themselves down but also lets the pipeline feeding them hide the embarrassing direct consequence of their policies.\n\nThat the traditional family is the last fortress of individual liberties against neo-Marxisms (including CRT) is well known to neo-Marxists as diverse as Mao Zedong and György Lukács; the former instituted mass state takeover of child-rearing from parents and the practice of kids denouncing their parents to authorities, while the latter instituted gender perversion programs, all of which, then as now, alienate kids from their parents and destroy the institution of family.\n\nKids need healthy families to grow and thrive.\n\nAn entire generation is being taught to feel guilty about who they are, or believe they are a victim - and in both cases children are told there is nothing they can do to change that. What a horrible lesson.\n\nThere'll be no future for America if the kids are dysfunctional, dumbed down and hateful of their neighbors.\n\nWai Wah Chin is the founding president of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance Greater New York and an adjunct fellow of the Manhattan Institute."

      "text": "Critical race theory is part of woke agenda -parents should fight it\n\nParents have been pushing back against attempts to indoctrinate kids in school using critical race theory , a framework that suggests America and white people are irredeemably racist.\n\nBut while CRT is woke nonsense, not all woke nonsense is CRT. Combating CRT is a good start, but parents should be targeting the whole woke constellation.\n\nConsider the Anderson School in New York City, one of only five gifted & talented citywide schools and highly sought after by parents. You'd think, given its commitment to rigor, the school would be less susceptible to this woke fever. You'd think wrong.\n\nAlas, the school has already spent money on \"workshops about equity and justice in preparation for the incorporation of these topics in next year's curriculum\" and brought in Christopher Dadefumi, \"a notable coach who conducted several parent workshops this year,\" according to a statement. ­Every dollar spent on race-grifter coaches is a dollar not spent on ­actual instruction.\n\n\"The teachers will be reading the book 'Stamped' by Ibram X. Kendi and Jason Reynolds. As part of the Teacher's College curriculum in the fall, students in grades seven and eight will read the young-adult edition of 'Stamped.' Students in grades three to six will be reading the junior edition of this title by Sonja Cherry-Paul.\"\n\nThe children's version of \"Stamped\" calls math \"a racist weapon\" and portrays Abraham Lincoln as a villain. The prose is comically bad. A typical line: \"This is a present book. Not like a birthday present book, but like an everyday present book. Or maybe just an everyday book.\" It only gets worse from there.\n\nIs \"Stamped\" CRT, technically speaking? Maybe not. But why is this book being forced on kids at a school where academic achievement is allegedly taken seriously?\n\nIt isn't happening just in lefty New York City, and it isn't just white parents complaining. A Mexican-American father in ­Gilbert, Ariz., spoke up when his teen daughter learned about skin color granting \"privileges you didn't earn.\"\n\nEleventh-graders in Mancelona, Mich., were asked \"to reflect on how white privilege operates in their personal lives.\" High schoolers at Loyola Academy in Wilmette, Ill., were made to answer: \"How do you benefit from white privilege, and how have you held onto that benefit (despite knowing the harm it does)?\" Middle schoolers in Cape Coral, Fla., were schooled on their white privilege.\n\nElementary schools get in on it, too. CRT slayer Christopher Rufo reported a third-grade teacher in Cupertino, Calif., asked students to \"create an identity map,\" listing their race, class, gender, religion, family structure and other characteristics. They were told to \"circle the identities that hold power and privilege.\" This was during a math class. A teacher in Oakland, Calif., is teaching first-graders about \"microaggressions, gender inequality, gender identity and structural racism.\"\n\nThis neo-racism (with gender ideology thrown in) is not OK. The idea of dividing children into victims and oppressors should disgust all Americans.\n\nThe wokesters will argue that fighting race-based education in schools is akin to not wanting to teach about slavery. This is exactly backward. Every minute spent engaging with this New Age garbage is a minute not spent on actual academic subjects, including learning about slavery, Reconstruction and much more. When kids are forced to endlessly investigate their white privilege and sexuality, they won't have much time for learning America's complicated history.\n\nMaybe that's the point. Wokeness is performative, and it's also ­incredibly shallow. Wokesters read a few (bad) books and decided to rewrite our education system based on this gimcrack research. That's much easier than actually teaching math, English and, yes, history. They pay the huckster consultant and feel like they've done their jobs as educators.\n\nWokeness doesn't have to be CRT to be stupid. There's a reason little of this ever appears on actual curricula. The idea is to leave parents out of discussions about how controversial subjects should be taught, and parents are, en masse, not having it.\n\nGood. Our kids deserve better than to be educated under this dogmatic leftist cult. Parents have to ­expand their fights beyond CRT.\n\nTwitter: @Karol"

      "text": "Critical race theory is teaching kids to hate each other\n\nWhen parents reject public-schools teaching critical race theory, a common retort from the left is that it's a university graduate-level analytical framework that's incomprehensible by children and therefore incapable of being taught in K-12 schools.\n\nThis attempted gaslighting of parents and conservatives from Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis - nothing to see here! - through such false claims is destructive.\n\nIn fact, we're already seeing the horrifying results on our kids.\n\nJust because CRT began as a 1970s-era, law-school-level analysis doesn't mean it isn't adapted for lower-level understanding.\n\nAlbert Einstein and Isaac Newton broke barriers in comprehending the laws of physics, but the vast majority of us can never fully, technically grasp how or what they did.\n\nYet the basics of physical science are age-appropriately adjusted for masses of students from elementary to high school.\n\nThe truth is union-controlled public schools are teaching kids to be racist - paid for by your tax dollars - and it's making schools more dangerous and disharmonious.\n\nInstead of the promised racial reckoning blossoming into racial utopia, the CRT crowd is fracturing America.\n\nDr. Martin Luther King Jr. dreamed of a country where children are judged by their character, not skin color.\n\nBut in January, school officials forced students at Virginia's West Springfield High School to watch a racist, dehumanizing video about microaggressions.\n\nIt depicts white people as blood-sucking, cartoon mosquitos who must be destroyed by nonwhite people wielding flamethrowers.\n\nIn Orlando, Fla., Howard Middle School black teacher Ethan Hooper proudly displayed his Black History Month video on TikTok, showing his white students bow down to, luxuriously fan and cater to their black classmates.\n\nAnd in Springfield, Ohio, police reported an incident at Kenwood Elementary School, where a group of black students on the playground rounded up white students \"and forced them to state, 'Black Lives Matter,' against their will.\"\n\nPolice say the black students could face charges of assault and menacing.\n\nWhat's unfolding in real life echoes what Iowa schoolteacher Jane Elliot found decades ago.\n\nStarting in 1968, Elliot indoctrinated her students in a troubling \"experiment\" where she'd teach kids with brown eyes to despise and marginalize blue-eyed students and vice versa.\n\nHer students responded aggressively against those with the opposing eye color, leading to bullying and abuse.\n\nElliot's unethical tactics needlessly harmed students' academic performance.\n\nWe now have a nation of Jane Elliots from coast to coast.\n\nIt's vitally important to teach children to reject racism and learn empathy.\n\nBut today's schools introduce a new kind of racialism that reduces human beings to prisoners of their race, rather than unique individuals.\n\nBlack Lives Matter and CRT are failing to create effective racial healing.\n\nIn 2014, the last year before BLM rioters began burning down majority-black neighborhoods and destroying black-owned and -operated businesses, Gallup found 55% of Americans said they were \"very\" or \"somewhat\" satisfied with the state of America's race relations.\n\nJust 35% said they were \"very\" or \"somewhat\" dissatisfied.\n\nThose numbers flipped in 2015, with 62% reporting dissatisfaction with race relations and just 30% reporting satisfaction.\n\nIn 2021, things got worse, with 71% reporting dissatisfaction in race relations and 61% this year.\n\nWe know CRT's race-obsessed lens doesn't work.\n\nSo why are schools doubling down on this toxic, Marxist-rooted philosophy?\n\nIt stems from the 1930s-era, Marxist-inspired Frankfurt School.\n\nGermany's Frankfurt School founders, who created critical theory, sought to dismantle capitalism and Western civilization, just as America's CRT does today.\n\nIndeed, BLM founder Patrisse Cullors, proudly calls herself \"a trained Marxist.\"\n\nCRT divides people by skin color through ideologically infused methods. Despite what leftists claim, this is not teaching neutral history.\n\nIt is a political ideology that relies on lies, including The New York Times' \"1619 Project,\" an ahistorical assault on truth.\n\nSign up to get the best stories straight to your inbox.\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nTragically, the \"1619 Project\" is peddled to schoolchildren nationwide.\n\nCRT supporters ignore the fatal effects of LBJ's Great Society, which ravages black families and neighborhoods.\n\nThey ignore black conservatives like Thomas Sowell, Shelby Steele and Jason Riley who prove how welfare decimates families.\n\nThey're dead set on dismantling capitalism, never mind the good it's done, and teaching young Americans to loathe their country.\n\nAmerica's far from perfect, but we cannot deny the enormous progress Dr. King and the civil-rights movement wrought.\n\nCRT backers would have us reverse that progress, stepping back to the time of segregation.\n\nTeachers pushing this pernicious philosophy in the classroom and out are engaged in a perilous experiment whose results are already obvious: CRT divides us in alarming ways.\n\nCarrie Sheffield is a senior fellow at Independent Women's Voice and Tony Blankley Fellow for American Exceptionalism at The Steamboat Institute.\n\nAdvertisement"

It contains information about various schools - including Cornell in Ithaca, where Jacobson teaches - as well as links to critical race training activity there.\n\n\"This summer, Cornell University announced a series of actions to respond to advocates of critical race theory,\" the website reads. \"A for-credit, university-wide graduation requirement covering 'systemic racism, colonialism, bias and inequity' is under development. Additionally, the university announced the creation of an 'anti-racism' research center, as well as possible reform of its police department.\"\n\nJacobson told Fox News that people need to know that higher education \"is the source of the problem.\"\n\n\"It provides the ideological mothers' milk for activists and trains the people who then go onto jobs in government and primary/secondary education and the 'journalists' who push this coverage,\" he said.\n\nCritics, including Discovery Institute researcher Chris Rufo, believe critical race theory perpetuates racism by encouraging segregation, Fox News reported.\n\nProponents say the intellectual movement helps people better understand race and its relevance to all social interactions.\n\n\"Racism is not extraordinary,\" Angela Onwuachi-Willig, an expert on the theory at Boston University School of Law, told the Boston Globe . \"Race and racism are basically baked into everything we do in our society.

Children for communism\n\nEarlier this year, a whistleblower uncovered a fifth-grade social studies lesson in Philadelphia that asked students to celebrate the \"black communist\" Angela Davis. Students were asked to act out \"free Angela Davis\" rallies, demanding that the government release the Black Panther imprisoned on charges of murder, conspiracy, and kidnapping.\n\nThe Philadelphia public school system released an \"Antiracism Declaration\" last summer that said educators must \"no longer be passive or disjointed in [their] approach.\"\n\n\"Race is the social construction that set the foundation and built the infrastructure for the United States we know today,\" the memo read . \"Racism is the root of all other forms of injustice and provides the nourishment needed for other systems of oppression to thrive. As such, in order to destroy the tree, we cannot simply pick at the leaves or chop away at the trunk, we must destroy the root.\"\n\n2. BLM's Buffalo soldiers\n\nThe Office of Culturally and Linguistically Responsive Initiatives in Buffalo, New York, announced a new curriculum for fifth-grade students last July centered on Black Lives Matter. The lessons include learning the Black Lives Matter \"declaration on Black Villages.\"\n\n\"We are committed to disrupting the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and 'villages' that collectively care for one another, and especially 'our' children to the degree that mothers, parents and children are comfortable,\" the lesson read.\n\nOne of the core tenants of Black Lives Matter had long been rebuking the \"Western-prescribed nuclear family structure.\" After much criticism, the organization took that goal off its website .\n\n3. Homework for parents\n\nAt the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, a private primary school that can run upward of $40,000 a year in tuition, parents are asked to \"decenter whiteness at home and in [their] family.\"\n\n\"Pay attention to how your language may perpetuate 'universal' standards of beauty, speech, behavior, dress, conflict resolution, etc.,\" a memo from a middle school teacher read. \"It's quite common for a person to compliment two of my three children on their beautiful blue eyes. While I always appreciate the compliment, I am conscious of my third brown-eyed child - what message is she receiving about how she fits in with European standards of beauty? When in my own positive and negative interactions with children have I come from a white-centered approach?\"\n\n4. Fear and learning in Las Vegas\n\nA black mother filed a lawsuit against a Las Vegas charter school earlier this year over a course that mandated seniors list elements of their identity that would be regarded as privileged.\n\n\"William Clark was compelled to participate in public professions of his racial, religious, sexual, and gender identities, and would be labeled as an 'oppressor' on these bases,\" the mother's court filing read.\n\nLessons in the course included statements such as \"reverse racism isn't real\" and that the traditional idea of family \"reinforce[s] racist/homophobic prejudices.\"\n\n5. Amazing Grace\n\nAt the Grace Church High School in New York City, students are asked to stop referring to their parents as \"mom and dad.\"\n\n\"While we recognize hateful language that promotes racism, misogyny, homophobia, and other forms of discrimination are already addressed in our school handbooks, we also recognize that we can do more than ban hateful language; we can use language to create welcoming and inclusive spaces,\" a memo from the school read.\n\nGrace Church High School, which has a tuition of around $53,000 a year, defended its guidance.\n\n\"We have been trying to help families find the right words for years and this was designed as an aid to that process,\" the school's headmaster George Davison said."

      "text": "Critical race theory organizers plot their return to the classroom\n\nThe top practitioners of critical race theory just held a weeklong \"summer school\" in Nashville to strategize, assess the movement, and debate how best to proselytize the next generation. It was an instructive six days of revolutionary agitprop.\n\nTwo things immediately stood out. The first is that, yes, despite its protestations to the contrary, the architects of CRT know they must focus intently on those who participate in the teaching profession. If CRT is a tool to be used for \"revolutionizing a culture,\" as its intellectual godfather, Derrick Bell, once put it , it must be implemented by teachers starting in K-12 and through graduate school.\n\nK-12 teachers, along with students at all levels, were given special ticket prices to the CRT conference at a deep discount, as my colleague and friend Jonathan Butcher pointed out . K-12 principals also were given a special package, though at a smaller discount.\n\nThe other unmistakable takeaway is that CRT practitioners are aghast at the resistance they have encountered. The public, parents in particular, saw the attempted takeover of their cultural institutions that gathered speed four years ago and fought against it, much to the chagrin of the CRT elite and their followers.\n\nAnd the summer school was indeed organized by the elite most wounded by popular rejection. It was led by Kimberle Crenshaw, a law professor at Columbia and UCLA. She is not just one of the key founders of the movement, but actually gave CRT its name at the discipline's founding conference in Madison, Wisconsin, in 1989.\n\nCrenshaw also invented the concept of \"intersectionality,\" by which the CRT founders mean that people can be discriminated against based on different attributes - their race, gender, able status, etc.\n\nAlso on hand to teach CRT was Cheryl Harris, another CRT founder and also a law professor at UCLA; Gloria Ladson-Billings, who perhaps has done more than anyone else to spread CRT's ideas among the teaching profession; and Michael Eric Dyson, whose accomplishments do not equal those of the other three, but who's much better known by the public because of his repeated media appearances. All in all, 40 academics, some very well known, were advertised to appear.\n\nThese CRT summer schools started in the long hot summer of 2020, when the whole country was aflame in the Black Lives Matter riots. It looked to the CRT folks then that the world was their oyster, as many leaders of cultural institutions were ready to surrender and accept many CRT principles.\n\nBut the oyster has gone bad and begun to stink up the room. In 2020, the summer school organizers saw the moment as a \"great opportunity.\" Those who led this year's summer school, however, regard the present moment with a growing sense of dread.\n\nIn their triumphant 2020 announcement , the summer school organizers proclaimed that \"the enduring racial inequalities laid bare by the casual murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery ... have loosened the grip of colorblindness as the officially sanctioned anecdote to persistent racial injustice.\" The 2020 summer school was held \"to capture the significance of this opportunity.\"\n\nOne must hasten to explain that, though most people think colorblindness is very much a good thing and an aspirational goal, it is anathema to CRT.\n\nCRT is a body of work that depicts racism not as an individual act or attitude, but as a \"systemic\" problem. Racism, it preaches, is embedded in the ordinary business of society, and keeps the oppressor group (whites, males, Christians, heterosexuals, but also Jews, Asian Americans, or anyone else that generally meets with success) in power and wealth, while keeping members of victim groups subjugated. To reverse this dynamic - a goal derived entirely from Marxian concepts - CRT practitioners believe that government and industry must pursue color-conscious action.\n\nContrast the optimism in the summer of 2020 with this year's foreboding summer school. The description to this year's opening plenary meeting on July 28 said, \"Our kick off plenary for CRT Summer School focuses on Tennessee as the 'tip of the spear' for the nationwide backlash against racial justice and democracy.\" Every session revolved around this idea.\n\nAs Crenshaw said to radio host Kaye Wise Whitehead in a video advertising the event, \"We started this in the middle of the summer of reckoning, recognizing that critical concepts, like structural racism and implicit bias and intersectionality were all part of the mobilization that we saw in 50 states across the country, demanding accountability. Well, now we are at a point where the backlash against 2020, the backlash against racial justice, has taken the form of suppressing our right to learn, our right to know, our books.\"\n\nAll of that is hyperbolic, of course. Many, many people have developed antibodies against the attempted takeover of their country by Marxist academics, and their political leaders have responded by passing laws that make it hard to indoctrinate students and teachers with CRT and eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion mandates from schools and universities.\n\nThese ideas are spread especially in schools of education, where unsuspecting and well-intentioned would-be teachers go to get their credentials.\n\nI spoke to Beanie Geoghegan, co-founder of the group Freedom in Education, who has done a lot of work in this area. When I asked her if education students knew what they were being fed, she said, \"Absolutely not.\" The professors pushing this stuff \"really prey on people who care about children,\" she added.\n\nIt's a good thing they are so discomfited at the moment.\n\nMike Gonzalez is the Angeles T.

      "text": "How critical race theory makes its way into schools\n\nThe escalating battle over critical race theory has shone a spotlight on a previously obscure process: how local school districts set the curricula shaping what students learn.\n\nLocal school board meetings devolved into emotional and chaotic scenes across the country this spring, as parents joined a grassroots movement pushing back on what they described as attempts to indoctrinate their children on the issue of race.\n\nThe explosion of opposition to critical race theory - a catch-all term for lessons and policies that encourage children to see themselves and others almost exclusively through the lens of race - has led to debates over who should influence the classroom agenda. School boards, administrators, parent groups, teachers unions, and even outside activists have laid claim to setting the agenda for K-12 children.\n\nBut whose job is it?\n\nMorgan Polikoff, associate professor of education at the University of Southern California, said individual school districts typically select what textbooks to adopt and content to teach.\n\n\"In the vast majority of states, the decision is basically 100% local,\" Polikoff said.\n\n\"As far as I'm aware, it's almost always that case that educators, whether that is a committee of teachers or some kind of standing curriculum committee, will make an adoption decision, usually based on some kind of evaluation process, and then they will take it to the school board,\" Polikoff said. \"It's virtually never the school board themselves making some kind of a decision, it's more the school board rubber-stamping the decision that is made by local educators.\"\n\nParents and activists opposing critical race theory have applied the most pressure to local school boards in their fight to keep the curriculum away from classrooms, given the authority of most local boards to approve or block decisions on things like reading materials.\n\nIn Loudoun County, Virginia, parents launched a political action committee in April to organize a recall effort aimed at unseating several Loudoun school board members.\n\nIn Southlake, Texas, candidates opposed to critical race theory ran against sitting local school board members and won in May after a race that centered almost entirely on the issue.\n\nBut state school boards have also waded into the fight, issuing rules in some states seeking to prohibit material related to critical race theory.\n\nIn Oklahoma, for example, the state school board used its emergency powers last week to enact a rule banning critical race theory and certain types of gender-focused instruction.\n\nThe rule included provisions that could strip teachers and school staff of their certification if an investigation found they violated rules against promoting the controversial curriculum.\n\nJonathan Butcher, education fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said state school boards are typically involved in developing the framework individual districts should operate within.\n\n\"Usually the way you want the policy process to go is, it's the responsibility of the state board to set parameters on standards and, broadly speaking, curriculum, and then it's the local districts that pick the standards in line with the standards that the state board has adopted,\" Butcher said.\n\nHowever, politics has played a role in influencing the school board in some cases.\n\nIn Georgia, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp wrote a letter to the state school board in May urging it to \"take immediate steps\" to prevent critical race theory from being included in curriculum standards. The state board passed a resolution condemning the theory the following month.\n\nThe resolution stated no school should accept federal grants involving versions of critical race theory.\n\nThe critical race theory debate has even drawn state legislatures into the fray.\n\nAt least seven states have passed legislation banning the instruction of critical race theory, according to the Brookings Institution .\n\n\"It's not unusual for school boards to make decisions one way or the other. What's unusual is for state legislatures to be passing legislation at the state level banning these particular discussions in a broad sweep at the local level,\" said Rashawn Ray, governance fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe Biden administration briefly flirted with the issue earlier this year at the federal level before retreating .\n\nThe Education Department in April proposed guidelines for a grant program urging applicants to focus on race, citing the work of Ibram X. Kendi, a controversial proponent of critical race theory and the New York Times's 1619 Project, which sought to contextualize American history around racism and has been criticized for inaccuracies.\n\nHowever, after receiving thousands of public comments that largely pushed back on the proposal, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona withdrew the references to anti-racist materials and clarified the Department of Education would not push for critical race theory in schools.\n\n\"This program, however, has not, does not, and will not dictate or recommend specific curriculum be introduced or taught in classrooms. Those decisions are - and will continue to be - made at the local level,\" Cardona wrote in a statement on Friday.\n\nButcher said the Biden administration's move could still signal to grant applicants who agree with critical race theory that such controversial curriculum is a priority. He said the federal government has used funding to impose educational policies in the past, such as the implementation of Common Core standards during the Obama administration.\n\n\"This has been done before, where administrations will come up with what they feel like is a priority, and then in various ways it will become felt by schools around the U.S.,\" Butcher said.\n\nBeyond the process fight, a broader conceptual debate has emerged over whether schools are actually proposing to introduce critical race theory.\n\n\"For the most part, overwhelmingly, I would argue 99% of teachers in kindergarten through 12th grade are not teaching critical race theory at all,\" Ray said. \"I think that is troubling, when you think about it, that critical race theory has become this bogeyman of sorts for really any discussion of racism or sexism in classrooms.\"\n\nProponents of standards labeled as critical race theory argue students need to learn more about how racism has shaped American life. They say schools should help foster conversations about race and equity that are more inclusive than the way those subjects are currently presented.\n\nBut opponents claim the style of teaching will only deepen racial divides.\n\n\"If we're looking at this closely, we're talking about racial prejudice and discrimination that critical race theory compels teachers and students to adopt and follow,\" Butcher said. \"And that's inappropriate.\"\n\nSome Republican politicians with national profiles and presidential ambitions have begun to take up the grassroots cause, as it takes hold as a major front in the culture wars.\n\nFor example, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have become outspoken opponents of critical race theory.\n\nBut the issue remains a local one, largely because the mechanisms for stopping it are at the local level.\n\n\"This is where these kinds of debates often play out,\" said Polikoff. \"Because education, as opposed to many other issues, is very much a local-control kind of policy. Where if it's healthcare or whatever, you're going to go to a higher level, but the school board is kind of the site of democratic action in K-12 education.\""

Since you don't know what fascism is, how can you struggle against fascism?\"\n\nDoesn't this remind you of attempts today to deflect attacks on critical race theory?

But they don't know what it is.\" This is gaslighting to make CRT's opponents question their understanding and doubt the evidence of their own ears and eyes.\n\nIt fits the progressive trope that conservatives are ignorant and stupid. Such contempt (which is reciprocated) led, among other things, to Donald Trump's victory in 2016. And just as it failed five years ago, it is failing again now. Which prompts the thought, if Left-liberals are so smart, why can't they think of a new line of attack and stop repeating what is so ineffectual?\n\nConservatives know very well what CRT is. It's not really a theory; it's the unfalsifiable assertion of racial essentialism, stigmatizing white people as irredeemably racist and privileged, and black people as systematically repressed. It is used to poison the minds of children down to the elementary school level. Public and parental understanding of CRT comes despite its advocates' efforts to obscure its meaning (which makes the Left's charges of ignorance grimly ironic).\n\nAnd this brings us back to Orwell's essay. His overarching argument was for clarity of language in political debate. He demanded then, as we should demand at least as urgently today, that language be used not to conceal meaning but to convey it.\n\nPolitical argument is conducted as dishonestly in 2021 as it has been within living memory. In a TV discussion a few weeks ago, I was confronted by Kristal Knight, former political director of Priorities USA, a left-wing activist organization, who defined CRT as a theory that \"racism undergirds all the systems of this country, how racism exists in our structure, and how racism was one of the foundations when our founding fathers created the Constitution.\" Amazingly, this was intended as a defense.\n\nShe asserted that CRT is \"not taught in K-12 education.\" Perhaps she should be introduced to Bryan Lindstrom, a history teacher and union organizer in Colorado, who declared on Twitter that \"critical race theory is a component of everything I do.\" Many of this ilk are fully aware that those who pretend CRT is an obscure academic discipline don't know or don't care about the truth.\n\n\"In our time,\" wrote Orwell, \"political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible.\" That's certainly true of advocacy of CRT."

      "text": "This is what critical race theory looks like in the classroom\n\nAt this point, there is plenty of evidence that critical race theory, or closely associated tenets, is being taught in public schools across the country. Most parents instinctually know that this ideology - which holds that America's institutions, and the people who allegedly benefited from them (i.e., white people), are irredeemably and systemically racist - is toxic and untrue. But a closer look at how CRT is applied in the classroom proves parents should not just be concerned about CRT - they should fear it.\n\nIn Santa Barbara, California, parents alleged that public schools forced their children to take \"ethnic studies\" courses as a condition of graduating and refused to let parents see the curriculum. In these courses, students were taught that all white people are racist, leading one student to contemplate suicide because he felt guilty for not being able to speak Spanish, according to investigative reporter Luke Rosiak.\n\nThe school district also awarded millions of dollars to leftist activist groups that helped develop the schools' curricula. One of these groups, Just Communities, which received $1 million in grants from Santa Barbara, was part of a now-defunct parent organization called NCCJ, known for its discriminatory trainings. During one event hosted by NCCJ, for example, students were separated by race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation, and their peers were instructed to \"call out every slur and stereotype they know about them,\" according to the San Francisco Chronicle. NCCJ staff members also participated in this exercise, insulting Asian students for having \"small penises,\" calling black students \"porch monkeys,\" and ordering Hispanics to clean up after the others.\n\nThese same tactics are being used by the Santa Barbara school district, parents alleged. One mother, Theresa Petino, said she sent her middle schooler to a Just Communities program that had been sponsored by the school district, only to discover that her child had been taught that Latinos and blacks will have a hard time ever finding success in the United States. Petino's son came home \"very upset,\" she said, and when she called a Just Communities teacher to find out what happened, the teacher allegedly responded by saying her son was a \"disgrace to his family.\"\n\nOnly after parental backlash did the Santa Barbara school district agree not to renew its contract with Just Communities. However, parents are still unable to view the classroom materials provided by Just Communities, which means they can't be sure what exactly this leftist organization was teaching their children. But given the group's track record, it is safe to assume that racialism was at the core.\n\nAt least now we know this is happening. But parents must remain vigilant. The goal of CRT is to reduce a person's worth to his or her skin color and replace our institutions with a hierarchy of privilege in which those \"worth the least\" receive the most and vice versa. It is blatant racism, and it is almost certainly in a classroom near you.\n\nKaylee McGhee White is the deputy editor of Restoring America for the Washington Examiner and a visiting fellow at the Independent Women's Forum ."

      "text": "Critical Race Theory Is Derived From a Laughably Dumb Series of Space Alien Stories Appallingly bad critical race theory science fiction showcases the ideology's toxicity.\n\nO ne of the more interesting periodicals of the hard-left, Jacobin , used to have a book review column for old and new conservative titles called \"Books we read, so you don't have to.\" It included mostly mass-market polemics the outlet's average reader would find especially triggering. If such a column existed for an audience of the opposite orientation, one title that would have to make an appearance is Faces at the Bottom of the Well: The Permanence of Racism by the late Harvard law professor, Justice Department attorney, and critical race theory pioneer Derrick Bell.\n\nThe book, published in 1992, is considered a founding text for the CRT movement. This is odd, as it's not a jargon-heavy, law-based tome, but a collection of short stories, most of them science fiction-based. If you're curious how sci-fi might translate CRT's heavily abstract and legalistic ideas, the short answer is that it doesn't. The stories are breathtakingly bad.\n\nWhen originally published, the New York Times referred to Faces as \"Jonathan Swift comes to law school\"; a description no honest critic could ever make. Science fiction, of course, is often rich in satire. If done well, like Swift's own satirical stories and pamphlets, it can help reveal something about ourselves and the world around us. Bell's stories do none of this. All they reveal is his utter maladroitness as a writer, his acute persecution complex, and just how puddle-deep the CRT ideas he helped develop really are.\n\nGetting through the thing will be too hard of a slog for most. Still, it's an important book, and liberals and conservatives should acquaint themselves with it. Recently, the New Yorker called Bell \"the man behind critical race theory\" and referred to Faces as among his most significant works. It was a New York Times bestseller and has enjoyed multiple reprints since. Currently, it has 450 reviews on Amazon and ranks No. 2, 2, and 6 in the retailer's civil rights law, discrimination constitutional law, and ethnic studies sections, respectively. It also appears on required or recommended reading lists at the University of California - Berkeley , American University , Brown University, Ohio State University , Pennsylvania University , the University of Baltimore , New York University , and no doubt dozens more schools across the country.\n\nAlthough nearly three decades old, all of today's CRT tenets are present in the Bell's stories: a rejection of Enlightenment rationalism; the denigration of \"liberal\" formal equality and \"neutral\" principles of constitutional law; the treatment of black slavery as America's original sin; the concepts of white privilege and allyship; and the pathologizing of white America more broadly. And like when CRT arose decades ago, the stories never got the rough treatment they deserve.\n\nBell's magnum opus opens with \"The Afrolantica Awakening,\" in which the mythic island of Atlantis emerges once again, presenting the earth with a new, green, and bountiful landscape. Unfortunately for American whites, however, the \"air pressure in the surrounding atmosphere\" somehow doesn't comport with their constitution, leaving them deathly short of breath. Not so for black Americans. They can breathe just fine in the new paradise.\n\nWhy or how this is so, Bell doesn't explain, thereby leaving out a key feature of the sci-fi genre. A big attraction for sci-fi readers is the world its authors create. Just as much as plot and theme, sci-fi is uniquely engaged with the background of these worlds and the explanations for the supernatural phenomena presented. Tellingly, this doesn't happen in Faces . Clearly out of necessity, Bell slaps it all together on the quick.\n\nEnter CRT. With the plot set, Bell spends the remainder of the story invigilating a debate within black America over the prospect of emigrating to the new land. There's the pro-leave side highlighting America's \"permanently racist'\"society, which apparently offers them nothing, and the remain side, which is satirized by Bell for naively appealing to modern black progress. As the latter argues, \"the slavery and segregation eras were important history, but they were just that-history. They were not cast from some eternal, social mold determining all of America's racial policies.\" But, much like today's 1619 Project (which he no doubt influenced), Bell indeed sees these periods in U.S. history as forever determinative of black America's future. White America is irreconcilable.\n\nFrom a pro-leave black minister, we then get CRT's equality-versus-equity distinction. In a fiery speech, the minister tells his audience:\n\nNow we endure the hateful hypocrisy of the equal-opportunity era that, like the \"separate but equal\" standard it replaced, denies the very opportunity its name proclaims. But at long last the lord has sent us a home that is hostile to others as America has been to us. Let us go there and show what-given the chance-we might have done here!\n\nOthers on the pro-leave side argue that establishing black communities is something whites have always opposed, so emigration must be a good thing. Putting aside that this would be an odd position for pro-segregation whites to take, Bell then sends the reader on a deep tangent about a real-life case involving black Muslims in Alabama being abused by white residents in the 1960s over their attempt to establish a farm there. For nearly two pages, Bell force-feeds the reader details not just about the episode, but also the black Muslims' subsequent legal complaint, including its constitutional claims and litigation history. But this is pretension, not fiction, and it becomes a painfully common feature throughout the collection.\n\nBell's literary flatness is oddly compounded by what he's actually literate in: the law. Shoe-horned throughout the stories are long, jarring diversions into civil rights law, constitutional history, controversial SCOTUS rulings of the past, and even deep dives into the litigation process. The tangents are not just led by the narrator but the characters as well, making for incredibly clunky and unnatural dialogue - at times, even block quotes and footnotes show up embedded in the character's speech.\n\nBut the collection's leading contribution is \"Space Traders, \"which became part of a TV-movie anthology of \"black science fiction\" in the early 2000s under the unfortunate title Cosmic Slop . It received a small amount of attention in 2012 when it was revealed that then-student Barack Obama praised Bell's protest against Harvard Law School over its supposed anti-black hiring practices.\n\nThe plot certainly makes it stand out. One day in America, aliens arrive from outer space offering the U.S. government a deal that will get chewed over for the rest of the story: In exchange for completely eliminating America's debt (the country is on the brink of bankruptcy) and fixing all its environmental problems (due to the \"white man's capitalism,\" the country's an ecological disaster), the aliens ask to take the country's entire black population back with them to space. What for and, again, why just black Americans, the reader is never told.\n\nHow can the aliens eliminate America's debts? Bell simply tells us that they brought lots of gold bars with them. How will America replace fossil fuels and clean up its wastelands? The aliens have \"special chemicals.\" And how would the public actually respond to the arrival of extraterrestrial life? Bell doesn't even give us a sentence. Ray Bradbury this is not.\n\nThe president's cabinet, being all white and either overtly or covertly anti-black, are ecstatic over the offer. How to sell it to the American public, especially the black public, is the next challenge. The interior secretary, who, we're told, just finished destroying the last old-growth forest in America, voices the idea of selling the transfer to black Americans as a helpful way to put them in a \"less competitive environment\" (after which he gives a smirk and a wink to the president). This provokes a laugh from adviser Gordon Golightly, the story's Thomas Sowell-esque Uncle Tom protagonist - Bell derides non-CRT-supporting black Americans throughout the collection.\n\nBut not all whites are supportive. For example, much of big business (being portrayed as white, of course), fear what a loss of black consumers would mean to their bottom line. This especially includes businesses who \"profit off\" ghetto communities, like suppliers to law enforcement agencies and prisons. It also includes the real estate industry which, we're informed, \"annually reaped uncounted millions in commissions on sales and rentals, inflated by the understanding that blacks would not be allowed to purchase or rent in an area.\"\n\nMeanwhile, organized Jewish groups, we're told, sign a petition against any non-voluntary mass transfer. But an unspoken motivation, Bell tells us, is that:\n\n... in the absence of blacks, Jews could become the scapegoats for a system so reliant on an identifiable group on whose heads less-well-off whites can discharge their hate and frustrations for societal disabilities about which they are unwilling to confront their leaders.\n\nFollowing an inordinately detailed description of how the White House legally pushes through the population transfer (executive orders, congressional acts, constitutional amendments, in addition to a detailed discussion of long-gone post-Reconstruction and pre-Civil Rights-era court rulings), the story ends on Martin Luther King Jr. Day with 20 million black Americans in their underwear (the aliens want this for some reason), being forced into alien spaceships with U.S. soldiers standing behind them, machine guns drawn.\n\n\"The Last Black Hero\" is a non-sci-fi contribution and it's perhaps the most awkward and cringeworthy vehicle Bell uses to spout the tenets of CRT.\n\nThe story begins with Jason, a promising young leader of the black advocacy group, \"Quad A\", convalescing in the hospital following a white racist's bomb attack (of course). In the room is Sheila, his white doctor who was born poor in the Bronx but who is described as \"white and born privileged\" nonetheless. There's also Neva, a high-up black member of Jason's group, who, despite being a child of professional parents and raised in white, upper-class neighborhoods, gets no \"privileged\" descriptor.\n\nAlthough Sheila grew up as a poor minority in the Bronx, she airs the kind of woke opinions commonly found in cloistered, white middle-class areas. When she develops a relationship with Jason, the story becomes one long struggle session for her about whether she should follow her heart and, in so doing, sully Jason's image as a black leader. The dialogue that follows deserves the kind of trigger warnings that CRT professors call for today, but for the un-woke.\n\nFor instance, in the story's I-can't-quit-you moment, Sheila tells him:\n\nJason, I love you and want to marry you. In conformity with the age-old pattern of black sacrifice to serve white needs, will you risk your leadership role in Quad A and the respect you've earned in the black community in return for my love?\"\n\nBut the internal agony proves too much for Sheila. Her white guilt and commitment to another group's identity pushes the doctor into a neurotic meltdown. She dramatically (and oddly) tells him, \"I cannot and will not change what I am: a white woman.\"\n\n\"But,\" she says, \"I reject all the privileges society has bestowed upon me because of my race, and accept willingly all the burdens of yours, including a decision that you must return to your work without me.\"\n\nIn the end, Sheila chooses to part with Jason for the good of the black cause. As she tells Neva, who comes to visit her leader in hospital (and who also has the hots for him): \"I understand how black people, and particularly black women, feel about losing one of their most able men in an interracial marriage. I'm afraid it would destroy Quad A. I simply will not do that to Jason or to black people.\"\n\nBell does capture Sheila's self-punitive white guilt well, but his vehicle isn't quite right. Although Sheila's poor background is clearly a way to introduce the concept of white privilege, whites who attend BLM protests, for instance, generally don't come from poor, mixed neighborhoods. They come from more homogenous areas where racial realities present themselves far less often.\n\nFrom these as well as other stories found in the compilation, we can see that Bell's impoverished fiction reflects the immaturity of the ideas and positions it seeks to promote. His portrayal of white America is especially bad, approaching as it does near-grotesque levels. Whites are shown as either enemies or neurotic allies; not people with complex lives and backgrounds or individuals with their own merits and faults. Given this is more or less de rigueur in so much of academia today, it can unfortunately be said that Faces at the Bottom of the Well has been a wild success. And if its highly caustic, thin-gruel ideas go unchallenged, we might indeed see a \"permanence of racism\" become a fixture in American education and beyond.\n\nSo, how can we challenge these ideas? To start, anti-CRT activists and students should be pointing out just how embarrassingly bad the book is to heads of departments wherever it's taught while demanding its swift removal from all college reading lists. Something so outrageously offensive and utterly bereft of merit should have no place in any serious educational institution. Contacting alumni associations and grant-giving state agencies is another option. Such a project would seem to be ideal for conservative student groups on campuses where the book is assigned. Just one serious challenge should garner plenty of publicity and help bring attention to the vulgarity and depravity of one of CRT's main founders.\n\nMeanwhile, that such an appalling book forms the basis of CRT today is something every concerned anti-CRT advocate and parent group should know so they can integrate it into their talking points. By noting, for instance, that CRT is derived from a laughably dumb series of space alien stories peppered with the racist ravings of a deeply paranoid and embittered man will go far in stigmatizing its dangerous and anti-American sleight of ideas. Ironically then, in challenging the CRT movement at least, Faces at the Bottom of the Well does have much to offer.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "When White People Start Believing Critical Race Theory What happens when the loathed white majority views itself as a persecuted class?\n\nA s diversity equity and inclusion reaches its apotheosis, some erstwhile protected classes are chafing at their recent exclusion. Being diverse only matters if power and privilege are associated with the moniker. What happens when the loathed white majority views itself as excluded and as a persecuted class? America is about to find out.\n\nThe problem with this gussied up tribalism is that people start identifying with their tribe, especially if their tribe is at the bottom rung of the power structure. White men are no longer being judged based on the content of their character or the merit of what they produce. They're judged based on their skin color and gonads and they are de facto being deprived of college placement and job promotions. They're being pushed out of polite society and have become the butt of every joke. (READ MORE from Melissa Mackenzie: On Becoming Catholic )\n\nMany say, \"well, it's about damn time\" as they perceive white men as privileged people - people, who through no qualifications other than being white and male, sat at the top of the power structure. If white men endure a couple of generations of persecution, it's no more than they deserve for all the colonization, destruction, and unearned benefits they've enjoyed.\n\nThe younger generations ... believe in protected classes and power and they view Jewish people as white and powerful.\n\nThe only problem with this equation is that these people being shoved, forcefully, to the bottom rung still make up the majority. That is, if they choose to fight back, numbers are on their side.\n\nTo this point, white men and white women haven't viewed themselves through a critical theory lens. They've been inculcated with the idea of a color-blind society, a melting pot. Fairness meant seeing people as individuals and to not judge a whole group based on one person. That idea was called racism. It was considered racist to demonize a whole racial group. Racism was anathema to most white people, save a few racist stragglers. The worst epithet that could be hurled at a white person was \"racist!\"\n\nFurther, in critical theory, \"people of color\" (not colored people, mind you) could not be considered racist because to be racist, one has to have power. The question now: Who has the power?\n\nJudging by the recent Congressional hearings interviewing the women heading the various ivory towers, it's not white men.\n\nRacism against white people is now the norm. From government Christmas parties excluding white employees to \"safe spaces\" on campus, discrimination against white people isn't just allowed, it's encouraged.\n\nThe woke didn't reckon that a white majority might also seek victim status once the boot to the face jammed the whites down the ladder of status, simply for being white. They thought their racism would have no consequences; they still seem to think that.\n\nLeft out of these leftist will to power calculations is that the white majority is increasingly secular. Previously, their Christianity served as a limit to behavior. Christians submit to God, have faith in Him, and God, in the Christian worldview, views each person as an individual, \"Neither Jew nor Greek, male nor female, slave nor free.\" God, in the Christian worldview, sees each soul and Christians are told to view people that way, too. Christians are told, \"Judge not, lest you be judged.\" Jesus is the ultimate judge and jury and so on an individual level, vengeance is God's, not the Christian's.\n\nChristianity isn't tribal. It's universal. It's the whole body of Christ - each person has a role in the body and none of it has to do with one's skin color or intersectional status. What is made clear is, \"the last shall be made first.\" The Bible is filled with warnings about persecuting the poor and abusing those deemed as lesser in society. Jesus was also clear about loving one's enemies and blessing those who persecute you.\n\nAmerica's unifying themes were Christian. The Founders had this understanding as a foundation for the nation they were creating.\n\nAs the United States secularizes, a reality that makes the woke rejoice, the majority, once governed by limiting principles in the use of power due to Christian ideals, will no longer be limited.\n\nSome historically marginalized groups, primarily Asians and Jews, are chafing at the label of \"white.\" The same leftist Jewish professors and university funders who taught or believed in this intersectional clap-trap are alarmed to see the virulent anti-semitism that sat beneath the surface, and worse, that no one is fighting against it because Jewish people have been lumped in with white people as \"colonizers.\" Jews, in this critical analysis, deserve abuse because they are white, have positions of power, and are oppressors against the brown people. It doesn't matter that Hamas attacked Israel. It doesn't matter what is just or right. What matters is that in the critical theory hierarchy, Jews are perceived as white.\n\nWhile some Jewish liberals such as Bill Ackman and Alan Dershowitz have recently spoken out against campus DEI efforts, it is interesting that Jewish leftists are not scrambling, as they should be, to dismantle the critical theory concepts that led to this evil place. Rather, they're desirous of being viewed as a victimized class deserving of special considerations. Jewish leaders opposed California's adoption of a new Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, according to David Bernstein, author of Woke Antisemitism, because of \"its implicit omission of Jews as an oppressed group.\"\n\nCritical theory and intersectionality inevitably lead to a fractured society where all members identify with a group based on superficial characteristics so that they can have power. Or, when things go really badly, protection.\n\nUnfortunately, Jewish people in America and the world are a small group of people, proportionally. They're always at the mercy of the majority. In this case, the majority is white and nominally Christian. Up to this point, Jewish people self-identified as a persecuted class. They've been overruled by other persecuted classes who have decided to label them white and privileged.\n\nWhite identitarianism may be the only recompense the hated majority have to achieve respect and fair-play.\n\nTo the chagrin of many leftist Jewish people, America is standing alone as the major power defending Israel. Why is that? What is it about the older generations of American people that defends Israel and the Jewish people? Well, they remember the Holocaust, for one. For two, a Protestant nation believes that Jews are God's blessed people and to receive blessings, Israel and the Jewish people should be blessed.\n\nThe younger generations, the ones soaked in critical theory, do not believe this. They believe in protected classes and power and they view Jewish people as white and powerful.\n\nMarry this trend with white people secularizing and starting to see themselves not as Americans but as white Americans, well ... This new belief system is catastrophic for social cohesion.\n\nIt ends in violence.\n\nThe solution to this cultural disaster is not placing the Jewish people back into a protected class. The solution is to demolish the pernicious ideas of critical theory completely. DEI needs to be obliterated from every institution. It's an evil.\n\nWhat should replace this nonsense? Merit. Objective standards level the playing field and remove this garbage.\n\nIn addition, America needs a Christian revival. Love, not revenge, is the solution to this bleak cultural nonsense. Tearing down statues, creating \"safe spaces,\" and excluding people based on skin color will not right the wrongs of the past. It's only more evil that foments more anger and that's especially dangerous when those being made angry are the majority. (WATCH: The Spectacle Ep. 40: Victimhood, Religious Bigotry, and Max Miller )\n\nIn the critical theory calculation, one that is entirely tribal, might makes right. Have those pushing these ideas considered what that means for them? White identitarianism may be the only recompense the hated majority have to achieve respect and fair-play, but it will come at great cost. The woke haven't considered the price they might pay.\n\nREAD MORE from Melissa Mackenzie:\n\nKari Lake's Bid to Raise Arizona\n\nStumbling Into World War III\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Critical Race Theory Cynically Undermines Racial Harmony CRT seeks to con Americans into thinking our nation and our people are fundamentally racist.\n\nCritical race theory (CRT) is based on flawed and destructive assumptions. Its actual purpose is the complete opposite of its stated intent.\n\nIts leftist creators in academia and media claim it encourages racial understanding. The truth is that its cynical methodology further divides us when racial understanding and acceptance is key to our survival as the freest nation on Earth.\n\nWith its underlying assumption that all white people are racists, CRT is itself racist.\n\nWith its underlying assumption that all white people are racists, CRT is itself racist.\n\nDefined by Britannica , CRT is \"the view that legal institutions are inherently racist, and race itself, instead of being biological, is a social construct used by white people to further their interests at the expense of people of color.\"\n\nAs an African American, I assure the reader my skin color is not a social construct, nor is that of my Caucasian friends and colleagues.\n\nCRT is not curriculum, but a movement of the radical Left to use false charges of institutional racism to con Americans into thinking our history was, and remains, foundationally racist - a tactic within a strategy to move the country toward the tyrannical, self-serving Left.\n\nIt encourages people to despise traditional values that nurture safety, opportunity, and prosperity. By turning our backs on historical truth, we allow leftists to work their destruction into our fabric deep enough to change the color of the thread - from red, white, and blue to dark, shadowy, and dismal. With its underlying assumption that all white people are racists, CRT is itself racist.\n\nWe are not a perfect nation, but we are \"perfectible.\" We have met challenges like slavery, civil rights, war, and terrorism. In every case, after mistakes and debate, we got it right. If we seek hard truths, address the right issues, and look for quantifiable solutions to issues of race, we will get it right again.\n\nThe primary threats to African Americans in minority areas are crime, inferior education, and lack of economic opportunity - and now, violent leftist BLM and Antifa destruction. There are solutions for these problems, and they are more likely to succeed if people with positive intent don't have to shout over race-baiting leftists promoting hate.\n\nShamefully, our nation's capital is a snapshot of educational failures in minority communities. In Washington, D.C . , 90 percent of students are African American, and 63 percent of schools underperform. Only 37 percent of students pass post-secondary readiness exams. Black students receive the highest number of suspensions, and chronic absenteeism for this population is 35 percent, compared to 8 percent for white students.\n\nOther big cities with significant black populations perform similarly and have another thing in common - they have all been ruled by liberal Democrat elites for decades, many who promote CRT.\n\nIn December 2016, when the national unemployment rate was 4.7 percent, unemployment for black Americans was higher than any other group at 8.2 percent. In February 2020, it had fallen dramatically to 5.8 percent . The Trump administration's lowering of taxes and regulations gave minority small business owners - who are taxed at individual rates - a chance to expand and hire new employees.\n\nGuided by Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), in 2018 the administration created \" opportunity zones \" for distressed minority communities to create growth and jobs. By summer 2019, the program incentivized the private sector to invest $75 billion in these neighborhoods. By contrast, leftists have scorched many of our cities, causing untold billions in property damage and leaving many minority and immigrant business owners burned out of their shops and incomes.\n\nTwo factors have led to pervasive intra-community or \"black on black\" crime. First is the lack of educational and employment opportunities for young African Americans. Secondly, liberal policies and the Left's hedonistic pop culture have destroyed the nuclear black family, with 67 percent headed by single moms, who themselves struggle with lack of quality education and job offerings.\n\nNearly 90 percent of African American homicide victims are killed by other African Americans. Yet liberal city officials encourage criminality by ignoring lawlessness and often refusing to prosecute offenders. And if you bring up black on black crime and its destructive power, you're a racist regardless of your race.\n\nActions work. The Trump administration created the First Step Act that reformed mandatory sentencing and led to roughly 2,700 African Americans being released from prison. It also provides acknowledgment to the black community that people in office are willing to address their concerns.\n\nCritical race theory, banned from federal agencies by President Trump, is yet another weapon in the radical Left's toolbox to legitimize their heartless power grab. They use African Americans and gullible but well-meaning young minds to push destructive lies about our nation, our people, and our future.\n\nDecades of liberal rule in minority communities have turned them into killing fields. We must turn them back to fields of dreams. We can start by eliminating CRT.\n\nAmerica still strives to live up to its ideals. And we can - with measurable, compassionate, realistic policy solutions, not a program that takes the \"soft bigotry of low expectations\" to devastating and destructive new lows.\n\nAmb. J.

      "text": "Biden Admin Pushes Critical Race Theory in Public Schools Time for parents and concerned Americans to push back.\n\nW hen President Biden signed an executive order on Inauguration Day calling for \" an ambitious whole-of-government equity agenda ,\" he signaled that his administration would embrace the education agenda of the race-obsessed world of radical \"social justice\" politics. We now see further evidence of the president's intentions in the Department of Education's proposal to funnel grants to schools that teach critical race theory. This pernicious theory analyzes every aspect of American society and history through the belief that racism has been, and remains, central to American life, all while peddling revolutionary Marxist philosophy.\n\nThis program would further degrade history instruction in our public schools - already so pitiful that just 51 percent of Americans can name our three branches of government and only 15 percent of eighth-graders are considered proficient in U.S. history. We have been failing our students for years, and these efforts by the Biden administration would only compound the damage by replacing what's left of history and civics education with trendy, radical politics.\n\nAs a nation, we should rededicate ourselves to teaching the next generation our shared principles and heritage, the things that bind us together, make us Americans, and make our society unique in the world, and uniquely admirable.\n\nThe administration's new rule channels funding to \"projects that incorporate racially, ethnically, culturally, and linguistically diverse perspectives into teaching and learning.\" Applicants would have to show how their schools \"Take into account systemic marginalization, biases, inequities and discriminatory policy and practice in American history.\"\n\nBy itself, this language sounds like government gobbledygook, but the examples provided in the rule reveal the administration's real goal - promoting critical race theory and radical anti-American politics. The rule upholds the New York Times' discredited \"1619 Project\" - a work of pure political activism, not history - as an example of the type of material the grant is meant to promote.\n\nThe 1619 Project is so flawed in its false historic narrative of an America founded on slavery and devoted throughout its history to preserving slavery and racism that the most prominent historians of the American founding have rejected it. James McPherson, a highly respected history professor at Princeton, called it \"a very unbalanced, one-sided account.\" At its core, the 1619 Project is not a work of history but of politics, the goal of which is to convince young Americans that our country is worthy of not admiration but contempt.\n\nIn the same vein, the rule uses the work of Ibram X. Kendi as an aspirational foundation illustrating what the grant is designed to accomplish. But Kendi isn't the scholar the Department of Education makes him out to be. He once outrageously implied that Justice Amy Coney Barrett is a \"white colonizer\" and has written , \"The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.\" Kendi is the leader of the activist campaign to paint all of America as racist and to demand new and different forms of racial discrimination as the solution to it.\n\nWe are already seeing what happens when the 1619 Project and Kendi, and the radical theories that justify them, are enacted at the local level. Oregon's Department of Education, for example, teaches the preposterous notion that \"white supremacy culture\" shows up in math classrooms when \"the focus is on getting the 'right' answer.\" In California, students had to participate in a unity chant to Aztec deities to fight for \"decolonization.\"\n\nThe initial grants of several million dollars proposed by the Department of Education are a small precursor to the Biden administration's effort to pass the Civics Secures Democracy bill, which would spend $1 billion of taxpayers' money per year for six years on this type of toxic civics education. This early skirmish about the grant program will shape the trajectory of the much larger battle to come.\n\nIf the Biden administration gets its way, these programs will become the norm. Students would be forced to swallow the tenets of critical race theory, and our public education system would become even more politicized - and even more harmful to our kids - than it is already. Parents and concerned Americans must push back against the infiltration of critical race theory and fight for curricula that teach the truth about America. A victory now will show the Biden administration that the American people reject this nonsense.\n\nNicole Neily is president of Parents Defending Education , a national membership association that combats political indoctrination in K-12 schools.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Unlike Critical Race Theory, a Genuine Education Is Liberal, Thoughtful, and Patriotic It sees much good in the American experiment.\n\nW ars over education are nothing new. Just counting the last 150 years, Americans have debated the role in the classroom of Roman Catholicism, prayer, evolution, intelligent design, sexuality, and other hot-button issues, often at times when the same concerns dominated broader public argument.\n\nThe current battle in American education concerns the use of critical race theory and other elements of a \"woke\" perspective. This position, broadly speaking, sees our history and present pervasively infested with racism and its pernicious effects. It seeks to recast our past, accusing it of systemic and individual bigotries, in order to comparably reckon with our social, religious, and political life today.\n\nCritical race theory and its accompanying positions deserve much of the extensive criticism it has faced. Proponents of the critical race theory perspective, however, do see something true about education that many others miss. Far too many students and teachers see education as inherently and simply vocational. In school, I often heard, in response to questions of why we must learn topic X or Y, that it would \"help us get a job.\"\n\nThose pushing critical race theory understand that education involves much more than obtaining skills and qualifications for employment. Education crafts souls - persons who occupy the concurrent roles of human being and citizen. Students will receive an education in morals and political principles somewhere. If we focus on STEM or STEAM as a response to critical race theory, we merely offload the moral and principled elements of learning to others.\n\nA true response to critical race theory must pursue an education both liberal and thoughtfully patriotic. A liberal education seeks to cultivate free persons; a patriotic education desires grateful ones. Yet while this approach shares some common ground with critical race theory in the extent of education, it opposes critical race theory both in content and approach.\n\nRegarding content, a liberal and patriotic education sees much good in Western Civilization and the American experiment. Both have done much in cultivating humans as rational and possessing an inherent equality that still preserves a role for excellence. Both have, though sometimes slowly, lifted persons from economic, religious, and political oppression. Seeing and exploring these goods does not mean denying evils. The long-privileged position of Christianity within both, with its doctrine of sin and a fallen human nature, requires heirs of Western and American heritage to engage in perpetual, honest self-examination.\n\nBut his honesty in itself distinguishes liberal and patriotic education from critical race theory. Endeavors like the 1619 Project, for instance, engage in question-begging and cherry-picking of American history, positing a thesis at times in desperate search for any sort of prospective justification.\n\nMoreover, the approach to education differs. A truly liberal and patriotic education differs from indoctrination. A free person must learn to think for himself or herself. Free people must receive the tools to engage ideas and their fellow citizens thoughtfully. They must arrive at the truth through serious effort that ingrains such knowledge into the soul, not just on the tip of the tongue.\n\nComparably, a patriotic education that merely dispenses talking points does not deserve the name. When an aged Thomas Jefferson described the Declaration of Independence, he referred to it as \"an expression of the American mind.\" Our patriotism must be an enlightened one. It must respect the capacities of human thought and seek to encourage a love of one's country on that commitment. It must do so because our polity depends on man's capacity for self-government. \"We the People\" only rule in the political sense when educated also to rule ourselves in the social and private sense.\n\nCritical race theory tends to express itself in a very different manner. Speech is defined as violence if it doesn't espouse the \"correct\" political position. It undermines - if not denies - our rational, and thus free, capacities. It fears the freedom to learn.\n\nWhile this perspective has gained an increasing share of curriculums, certain national , state , and local bodies have sought to push back - limiting or banning it. Other educators have offered alternatives , hoping to limit and even rescind critical race theory's growth in favor of a better way. These efforts are worthwhile and deserve support as well as additional, though like, alternatives.\n\nIn this battle of the education wars, much is at stake. It displays our educational needs as persons and citizens. It also shows how deeply in need of reform our education system is. In embracing liberal and patriotic alternatives to critical race theory, we find a means to that reform. In doing so we may, to appropriate President Biden, build back better.\n\nAdam Carrington is an associate professor of Politics at Hillsdale College.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Exclusive: House Conservatives Target Critical Race Theory in Budget Proposal\n\nThe largest bloc of conservatives in the House is targeting critical race theory (CRT) throughout the federal government in their new budget proposal.\n\nRepublican Study Committee (RSC) Chairman Kevin Hern (R-OK) and RSC Budget and Spending Task Force Chairman Ben Cline (R-VA) are releasing the RSC's Fiscal Year 2025 Budget proposal on Wednesday called \"Fiscal Sanity to Save America.\" The budget from the almost 200-member group includes a large package of bills crafted to fight back against the promotion of and indoctrination with CRT throughout the federal government, the armed forces and military academies, and classrooms.\n\nRep. Ben Cline (R-VA), center, joined by other members, speaks during a Republican Study Committee news conference on the FY2024 budget, Wednesday, June 14, 2023, on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Mariam Zuhaib/AP)\n\nCRT began as a Marxist academic concept but is now being taught as an unquestionable collection of values rather than an abstract theory. The group of conservatives oppose CRT as a racist and divisive ideology, and their budget makes clear their belief that eradicating its principles, which have infiltrated the federal government and taken precedence over good stewardship of taxpayer dollars, is key to restoring \"sanity\" to the federal government's budget.\n\n\"Decades of Washington's reckless spending habits have left the American People to foot the bill through high inflation and rising costs, and we cannot continue down this irresponsible path,\" Cline told Breitbart News. \"The RSC budget proposes responsible, common-sense policy that bolsters the American economy, lowers inflation, slashes wasteful spending, and reverses the harmful, regressive, wasteful, and unnecessary policies that are crushing hardworking families. It's far past time that Washington restores fiscal responsibility, reduces spending, and balances the federal budget to get our country back on the right track.\"\n\nTo combat CRT, the budget targets diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs and similar race-based initiatives that devalue skills and competency in the hiring process and divide the American people along lines of race, ethnicity, or socio-economic status.\n\nThe budget also includes Rep. Julia Letlow's (R-LA) Parents Bill of Rights to provide more curriculum transparency to parents. The House passed that bill last year but the Senate has not brought it to the floor. The legislation \"aims to bring more transparency and accountability to education, allowing parents to be informed and when they have questions and concerns to lawfully bring them to their local school boards,\" Letlow said when her bill was passed.\n\nLegislation tackling CRT the RSC packaged in its budget includes:\n\nThe RSC's budget release comes as Congress is set to finalize FY2024 spending - almost six months after the fiscal year began. The President released his FY2025 budget just days before, and Congress is set to begin debating FY25 budget and appropriations measures in the coming weeks.\n\nWATCH - Dr. James Lindsay: Bill Gates, Soros Using CRT Advocates as \"Useful Idiots\" to Co-opt America for Their Own Purposes\n\nBradley Jaye is a Capitol Hill Correspondent for Breitbart News.

      "text": "U.S. Conference of Mayors Adopts Resolution in Support of K-12 Critical Race Theory\n\nThe United States Conference of Mayors adopted a resolution during its annual convention in which its members pledged to support the teaching of Critical Race Theory (CRT) in public K-12 education.\n\nDuring its conference held August 31-September 4, the mayors adopted Resolution Number 68, \"In Support of Critical Race Theory in Public K-12 Education.\"\n\nCRT is a Marxist ideology that embraces the concept that all American institutions are systemically racist, with whites as oppressors and blacks as victims.\n\n\" NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED , the nation's mayors support the implementation of CRT in the public education curriculum to help engage our youth in programming that reflects an accurate, complete account of BIPOC history,\" the document states.\n\nAuthor and mathematician Dr. James Lindsay drew attention to the mayors' resolution on Twitter, and writer Andrew Sullivan reminded his followers of the denials by teachers' unions and local school board officials that CRT is being taught in K-12 schools as they claimed it is a subject only for law schools:\n\nIn June, Dr. Paul Freeman, superintendent of public schools in Guilford, Connecticut, denied to angry parents he is teaching CRT, while using its language of \"equity,\" rather than \"equality,\" and \"diversity.\"\n\nIn a statement, he said in part:\n\nWe are working in Guilford Schools to be more equitable in our practice, to embrace diverse texts in our classrooms, to diversify our teaching ranks, to address difficult historical events honestly and openly, and to ensure that all children feel heard in their schools.\"\n\nA similar statement was made by Jeff Porter, superintendent of the Cumberland-North Yarmouth, Maine, school district.\n\nBreitbart News reported:\n\nPorter denied his district uses Critical Race Theory (CRT). However, following the death of George Floyd, the district sent a letter to the community, expressing its \"solidarity with Black Movement leaders\" and detailing its decision to work with Community Change Inc. (CCI), a Boston-based company that self-describes on Twitter as \"a non-profit that challenges systemic racism with a special focus on white people.\"\n\n\"Can't dismantle white supremacy without dismantling capitalism,\" CCI states.\n\nThe mayors' resolution defines CRT as \"the practice of interrogating the role of race and racism in society, in which racism can be seen across systemic, institutional and interpersonal levels operating over the course of time and across generations.\"\n\n\"Historical racism and racist systems have caused de jure and de facto discrimination against people of color and have created racial inequities in all facets of life in the United States, and these racial inequities continue to the present day,\" the resolution claims.\n\nThe document goes on to state the \"basic tenets of CRT\" include the \"recognition that race is not biologically real, but it is socially constructed and socially significant as a product of social thought not connected to biological reality.\"\n\nCRT also acknowledges, according to the document, that there are no isolated incidents of racism, but, instead, only \"manifestations of structural and systemic racism.\"\n\nThe resolution asserts CRT teaches racism is absolutely everywhere and rejects \"popular understandings about racism, including claims of meritocracy, colorblindness, and arguments that confine racism to a few bad apples.\"\n\nInstead, CRT recognizes \"that the systemic nature of racism, which is codified in law, embedded in structures, and woven into public policy, bears primary responsibility for reproducing racial inequality.\"\n\nCRT, the resolution continues, \"recognizes that racism is not a bygone relic of the past, but instead acknowledges that the legacy of slavery, segregation, and the imposition of second-class citizenship on people of color continue to permeate the social fabric of this nation.\"\n\nThe document asserts as well that \"learning and scholarship that ignores race is not demonstrating 'neutrality' but adherence to the existing racial hierarchy\" and that \"Black, Indigenous, & People of Color (BIPOC) have experienced a gap in achievement compared to their White counterparts, and these students need an equitable allocation of resources to fill in the gaps.\"\n\nMore black leaders, however, are speaking out against the teaching of CRT ideology.\n\nKendall Qualls, a former candidate for Congress in 2020, is leading a black school choice and anti-woke culture movement, starting in Minnesota and spreading nationally, that aims to challenge the narrative that America is a systemically racist nation.\n\nTakeCharge says its objective is \"inspire and educate black and other minority communities of their full rights and privileges as Americans granted to them by the Constitution.\"\n\nThe organization seeks to move black individuals \"to take charge of their own lives, the lives of their children and not to rely on government and politicians for redemption and prosperity.\"\n\n\"We do not apologize for embracing America or its history,\" TakeCharge asserts. \"We believe that a well-grounded knowledge of American and world history strengthens our diverse country.\"\n\nThe group denounces \"the idea that the country is guilty of systemic racism and white privilege\" and \"abhor[s] the concept of identity politics and the promotion of victimhood in minority communities.\"\n\n\"There are many prominent black Americans, including myself, voicing strong opposition to Critical Race Theory,\" Qualls recently told Breitbart News. \"If judging a person by their skin color was wrong during Martin Luther King, Jr.'s speech in the 1960s, it is wrong today.\"\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "School Board of Trustees Plays 'Critical' Role in Pushing Critical Race Theory, Despite Ketanji Brown Jackson's Denial\n\nGeorgetown Day School's Board of Trustees, of which Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson is a member, plays a \"critical\" role in the implementation of critical race theory at the school, despite Jackson testifying to the opposite.\n\nWhile being questioned by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) about Georgetown Day School's curriculum being steeped in critical race theory, Jackson said the ideology was only taught in law schools and that the board she sits on \"does not control the curriculum.\"\n\nSupreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson listens as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) speaks during a Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington DC, Wednesday, March 23, 2022. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nDespite this, documents from the school show an intense push to implement \"anti-racist\" ideology - a term used to surreptitiously refer to critical race theory - with the guidance of the Board of Trustees.\n\n\"We have begun planning for ways in which the Board can play its critical role in ensuring that we fulfill the GDS mission and for ways in which the Board can serve as a source of oversight and accountability for the important work to be done,\" a July 17 letter from Board chair Lisa Fairfax and head of school Russell Shaw says. \" We understand that the Board must be engaged in this work .\" [Emphasis in original].\n\nFairfax introduced Jackson to the Senate as nomination proceedings began.\n\nThe \"important work\" referred to in the letter included a wide variety of reforms, including \"concerns about curriculum.\"\n\nAfter having reviewed \"painful personal experiences\" from current and former students, parents, and faculty \"who identify as Black\" posted on the \"BlackatGDS\" Instagram page, Fairfax and Shaw felt obligated to \"acknowledge that pain and take action.\" They also apologized.\n\n\"And, we commit to doing better,\" the letter continues. \"We recognize that acknowledgement and apologies are not enough. Taken together, the stories we have gathered allow us to identify areas of our work ahead.\" [Emphasis in original].\n\nSome pinpointed areas of interest for Georgetown Day School were \"concerns about the GDS curriculum\":\n\nAbout whether it reflects the stories of all in our community, inappropriately portrays the Black community and other communities of color as victims, appropriately incorporates the positive contributions of members of the Black community, and tells those stories in ways that can be heard and understood.\n\nInterestingly, portraying non-white persons as inherent victims - or, \"oppressed\" - in American society is a key tenet of critical race theory. In this portion of Georgetown Day School's plan, the \"anti-racism work\" appears to be focused on both requiring white persons to acknowledge some role in perpetuating a racist society and creating \"affinity groups\" for black students, families, and staff.\n\nAn \"affinity group\" is a pet name proponents of critical race theory have given to segregation - typically racial - as they are focused on exclusively bringing together persons based on immutable characteristics.\n\nThe board came to \"a recognition that the entire GDS community-including members of the white community, students and parents, faculty and staff-must commit to engaging in the intentional work of fostering an antiracist environment.\"\n\n\"We have begun outreach efforts to members of our white community and others who do not identify as Black, and will be exploring ways to better ensure that our entire community commits to making GDS an antiracist institution,\" it continued. \" We understand that our work cannot be effective without meaningful engagement from, and partnership with, members of our white community and others who do not identify as Black .\"\n\nTo these ends, and others, the Board of Trustees was in charge of \"formulating an action plan with specific and concrete short-, medium-, and long-term goals and targets.\"\n\nAs part of that, Shaw was charged with \"continu[ing] the dialogue\" on how Georgetown Day School \"is committed to making Black Lives Matter at GDS.\"\n\nThe Board of Trustees' involvement with pushing \"anti-racist\" action may in part be attributed to a June 19 \" Call to Action \" which references such \"Board-approved principles\" as:\n\n\"Racism is a socially-conditioned pollutant that we all breathe in daily,\" it says. \"Cleansing the lungs requires us to engage in conscious and reflective teaching and learning practices to ensure that we are not, as a school, intentionally or unintentionally, perpetuating systemic and institutional racism.\"\n\nIn a message to \"Georgetown Day School's White Community,\" the school said that incidents like the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd are \"what occurs when we do not view the work of diversity, equity, and inclusion as all of our work.\"\n\n\"While modern technology makes visible the trauma of racism and anti-Black violence, that trauma is not new,\" it continues. \"As members of the GDS community, we ask you to join our White colleagues in holding ourselves accountable to the founding principles of our School.\"\n\nIt then lists the following \"work\" white persons can do to make race central to their lives:\n\n\"We will increase curricular and DEI programming opportunities for all of our students, with the goal of helping them understand what it means to be an anti-racist, including in our existing seminar classes,\" it concludes.\n\nGeorgetown Day School's agitation for critical race theory has resulted in their commitment to the \"Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action,\" which teaches children Marxist principles such as \"destroying the Western nuclear family,\" in favor of \"black villages\" - or the \"collective village\" - as well as being \"transgender affirming\" and \"queer affirming\" to create a \"network where heteronormative thinking no longer exists.\"\n\nWatch: Ted Cruz Questions Judge Ketanji Jackson Brown on Critical Race Theory\n\nIn addition, they provide a lengthy list of \"Family and Educator Anti-Racist Resources,\" which recommends to eight and nine-year-olds Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You , by Jason Reynolds and Ibram X.

Even things that look race-neutral are, on closer inspection, racist.\n\nThe idea has its origins in something called Critical Theory, which Andrew Breitbart explained in his memoir, Righteous Indignation: Excuse Me While I Save the World! .\n\nBreitbart News also noted :\n\nCritical Race Theory holds that the United States is racist by design, because its Constitution and all of its other institutions emerged in a context where slavery was legal. According to the theory, the very institution of private property in the U.S. is corrupt because it was enshrined in a system that saw black people as chattels.\n\nThe State of Florida, under Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), banned CRT from public schools. Other states and school districts, including some in California, have followed suit - while Democrats, such as Vice President Kamala Harris and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, have accused Republicans of suppressing history and propagating racist ideas.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reports :\n\nThe Temecula Valley Unified School District faces litigation over a ban it enacted on critical race theory, taking the culture-war battle over classroom instruction about racism to state court.\n\nThe suit filed Wednesday alleges that the Temecula board's ban violates the California Constitution's guarantee of a \"fundamental right\" to an education that protects students from racial discrimination. It also alleges that the ban violates state laws that set out mandatory learning standards that include discussions about racism, inequality and how past events are relevant in the present day.\n\nCritical race theory examines how racial inequality and racism are systemically embedded in American institutions.\n\nThe lawsuit could encourage similar efforts by left-wing organizations and activists throughout the country, the Times notes.\n\nPeople hold up signs during a rally against \"critical race theory\" (CRT) being taught in schools at the Loudoun County Government center in Leesburg, Virginia on June 12, 2021. - \"Are you ready to take back our schools?\" Republican activist Patti Menders shouted at a rally opposing anti-racism teaching that critics like her say trains white children to see themselves as \"oppressors.\" \"Yes!\", answered in unison the hundreds of demonstrators gathered this weekend near Washington to fight against \"critical race theory,\" the latest battleground of America's ongoing culture wars. The term \"critical race theory\" defines a strand of thought that appeared in American law schools in the late 1970s and which looks at racism as a system, enabled by laws and institutions, rather than at the level of individual prejudices. But critics use it as a catch-all phrase that attacks teachers' efforts to confront dark episodes in American history, including slavery and segregation, as well as to tackle racist stereotypes.

      "text": "What is Critical Race Theory? Breaking Down The Ideology That's Hitting Schools Across The Country\n\nIn a short period of time, Critical Race Theory (CRT) has quickly emerged as one of the most controversial topics in the United States. CRT has redefined the concept of \"racism,\" created contentious policies in military institutions, and turned staid school board meetings into war zones.\n\nBut what is Critical Race Theory? What does CRT teach? Who are the leading critical race theorists and popularizers? What do they hope to accomplish in the United States? Here are the facts you need to know.\n\nWhat Is Critical Race Theory?\n\nCritical Race Theory is an ideology which holds that racism is not restricted to people's attitudes or intentions; \"structural racism\" is deeply embedded into every aspect of American life. This \"systemic racism\" explains all disparities, or \"inequities,\" between racial groups. CRT's advocates believe that concepts like natural rights, meritocracy, and impartial justice are lies that white Americans tell themselves to maintain their hold on power and keep minorities down. To fix this unjust system and create \"equity,\" the government needs to massively redistribute wealth, power, and influence.\n\nThe Origin Story\n\nThis ideology dates back to the end of the civil rights era when academics noticed that, despite laws ensuring equality of opportunity, white people and black people still had not attained equality of outcome. They assumed these disparities must stem from racism - but they had a problem: Polls show there is less real racism in society than ever before. Racist attitudes have plummeted to historic lows. The number of newlyweds in an interracial marriage increased by 567% between 1967 and 2015. Black economic and educational attainment have increased dramatically. Despite manifest progress on every front, CRT analysts teach that \"racism is worse today than it was 50 years ago,\" because disparities between racial categories have not been fully eradicated.\n\nCritical Race Theory's intellectual leaders say the movement began with a conference at the University of Wisconsin-Madison Law School on July 8, 1989. In a 2010 interview, Richard Delgado described the people at the conference (which he attended) as \"a bunch of Marxists.\" Some of the most influential CRT scholars include Derrick Bell, Kimberlé Crenshaw, Richard Delgado, Alan Freeman, Angela Harris, Neil Gotanda, Mari Matsuda, Charles Lawrence, and Patricia Williams.\n\nCRT Scholar Derrick Bell - Neville Elder/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nThey pioneered the theory that racism is not primarily about individual attitudes, but \"structures\" created and designed to oppress minorities. CRT teaches that race is a social construct, not a biological reality; since all people are alike, differences between groups should be explained by racism. While individual Americans may shun racist views, discrimination was deeply woven into U.S. laws and norms and continues to create unequal outcomes. Because whites have a vested interest in maintaining social dominance, racist laws only change when it also suits white interests, something CRT calls \" interest convergence .\"\n\nMembers of minority groups may see their status suddenly change based on how it serves white interests, something CRT labels \"differential racialization.\" Finally, every member of a minority group must become a \"voice of color,\" telling stories of how racial discrimination has affected them - and the majority's job is to listen, believe, and obey.\n\nCRT Takes On A New Meaning\n\nIn concrete terms, CRT is deeply anti-American, in the denotative sense of the word. \"Racism is endemic to, rather than a deviation from, American norms,\" wrote Crenshaw in 1989. As a result, \"The normative stance of critical race theory is that massive social transformation is a necessary precondition of racial justice.\" Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic wrote in their book Critical Race Theory: An Introduction that \"racism is ordinary, not aberrational\"; it's \"the usual way society does business, the common, everyday experience of most people of color in this country.\"\n\nCritical Race Theory doesn't simply reject America: It rejects all the pillars of Western, Judeo-Christian civilization. \"Critical race theory questions the very foundations of the liberal order; including equality theory, legal reasoning, Enlightenment rationalism, and neutral principles of constitutional law,\" admit CRT pioneers Delgado and Stefancic. CRT ideologues, they continue, \"are also highly suspicious of another liberal mainstay, namely, rights.\"\n\nOne of the first things CRT throws out is nuance: Every difference in society is proof of deeply embedded prejudice. Ibram X. Kendi wrote in his 2016 book Stamped from the Beginning, \"When you truly believe that the racial groups are equal, then you also believe that racial disparities must be the result of racial discrimination.\" Yet \"[w]e have a hard time recognizing that racial discrimination is the sole cause of racial disparities in this country and in the world at large.\"\n\nIbram X. Kendi - Michael A. McCoy/For The Washington Post via Getty Images\n\nFollowing this logic to its natural conclusion, Kendi wrote in his 2019 bestseller How to be an Antiracist that racial discrimination is a moral and necessary step in America's redemption:\n\n[R]acial discrimination is not inherently racist. The defining question is whether the discrimination is creating equity or inequity. If discrimination is creating equity [minority wealth], then it is antiracist. If discrimination is creating inequity, then it is racist. Someone reproducing inequity through permanently assisting an overrepresented racial group into wealth and power is entirely different than someone challenging that inequity by temporarily assisting an underrepresented racial group into relative wealth and power until equity is reached. The only remedy to racist discrimination is antiracist discrimination. The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.\n\nThis ignores personal choice, moral agency, and the importance of the decisions we make to guide our own destiny. In 1950, 83% of black families had a father present; by 2015, the black illegitimacy rate had risen to 77% .\n\nFigures across the political aisle agree that out-of-wedlock births carry grave social consequences. As Barack Obama said , \"[C]hildren who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison. They are more likely to have behavioral problems, or run away from home, or become teenage parents themselves.\" Libertarian economist Walter Williams explained :\n\nAccording to statistics about fatherless homes, 90% of homeless and runaway children are from fatherless homes; 71% of pregnant teenagers lack a father figure; 63% of youth suicides are from fatherless homes; 71% of high school dropouts come from fatherless homes; and 70% of juveniles in state-operated institutions have no father. Furthermore, fatherless boys and girls are twice as likely to drop out of high school and twice as likely to end up in jail.\n\nEach one of these factors - lower educational attainment, crime, homelessness, gang membership - increases the likelihood of a family growing up, and ending up, in poverty. \"If we have learned any policy lesson well over the past 25 years, it is that for children living in single-parent homes, the odds of living in poverty are great,\" wrote current Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in 1996.\n\nCRT simply ignores these complicating factors and blames every differential outcome on an ill-defined \"systemic racism.\" To justify their program of complete social transformation, CRT theorists claim that, on a subconscious level, unearned \"white privilege\" makes all Caucasians guilty and resentful. \"Many critical race theorists and social scientists alike hold that racism is pervasive, systemic, and deeply ingrained. If we take this perspective, then no white member of society seems quite so innocent,\" wrote Delgado and Stefancic. Syracuse University professor Barbara Applebaum - who says her \"research is heavily informed by ... critical race theory\" - is clearer in her book Being White, Being Good: \"[A]ll white people are racist or complicit by virtue of benefiting from privileges that are not something they can voluntarily renounce.\" This has been codified into public school lesson plans: Teachers in Buffalo, New York, taught students that \"all white people play a part in perpetuating systemic racism.\"\n\nParents protest Critical Race Theory - ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe Implementation Of CRT\n\nAlthough some media personalities deny that public K-12 schools teach Critical Race Theory, its concepts clearly permeate school curricula nationwide - much to CRT founders' delight. \"Although CRT began as a movement in the law, it has rapidly spread beyond that discipline. Today, many in the field of education consider themselves critical race theorists who use CRT's ideas to understand issues of school discipline and hierarchy, tracking, controversies over curriculum and history, and IQ and achievement testing,\" wrote Delgado and Stefanic - in 2001. Nine years later, Stefanic said, \"Critical race theory is in some ways livelier in education right now than it is in law.\" Aside from the concern over the content of CRT, another worry for parents is that Kendi believes it is racist to measure literacy: Instead of measuring people's understanding of \"abstract\" things like \"words\" and \"equations\":\n\nWhat if we measured intellect by an individual's desire to know? What if we measured intellect by how open an individual's mind is to self-critique and new ideas?\n\nWhat if our educational system focused on opening minds instead of filling minds and testing how full they are?\n\nIgnoring students' knowledge of reading, writing, and arithmetic would certainly reduce the number of schools recognized as failures; it's not clear that would benefit the struggling students, of any ethnic background, who are trapped inside them.\n\nIn fact, a pervasive sense of failure and hopelessness seems baked into Critical Race Theory. CRT's founding father, Derrick Bell, believed that even if his followers succeed, they will fail. Bell wrote in his 1992 book, Faces at the Bottom of the Well:\n\nBlack people will never gain full equality in this country. Even those herculean efforts we hail as successful will produce no more than temporary \"peaks of progress,\" short-lived victories that slide into irrelevance as racial patterns adapt in ways that maintain white dominance. This is a hard-to-accept fact that all history verifies.\n\nBlack people, Bell wrote, must acknowledge their \"permanent subordinate status.\" Then why expend the effort? Why even try? Because gaining power is the name of the game.\n\nSome critical race theorists openly admit, amongst themselves, that they are more interested in power than in truth. Regina Austin - who now \" pursues her interest in the overlapping burdens of race, gender, and class oppression\" at the University of Pennsylvania Law School - wrote in 1995 that false conspiracy theories can help the cause. \"Conspiracy rhetoric prompts behavior that tends to improve the lives of many blacks,\" she wrote. \"Conspiracy theories create solidarity and facilitate mass mobilization.\" These theories are even better if they invoke \"old confirmed enemies like the Ku Klux Klan and the United States government,\" because they \"put[] limits on the forgetting and forgiving.\"\n\nUltimately, the Left hopes these conspiratorial canards will put them into a position to repeal America's founding document and end the United States as we know it. CRT's anti-Americanism earns it a welcome reception on the Left. As Osita Nwanevu wrote in The New Republic, because of \"the structural defects and inequities progressives have long identified within the constitutional system ... the American left should work toward abolishing the Constitution someday - either for a new document or a new democratic order without a written constitution .\" (Emphasis in original.) With this grounding, you can understand why Barack Obama told public radio in 2001 that the U.S. Constitution \"reflected the fundamental flaw of this country that continues to this day.\"\n\nPatriotic Americans might think that Critical Race Theory - with its circular reasoning, and ideological blinders - represents the fundamental flaw in American politics today.\n\nThe views expressed in this piece are the author's own and do not necessarily represent those of The Daily Wire .\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

      "text": "The Craziest Examples Of Critical Race Theory In Schools\n\nAs a growing number of American students, parents, and teachers are now very much aware, Critical Race Theory is heavily influencing the country's education system.\n\nFrom preschoolers to PhDs, American students learn that white people are inherently racist, that minorities belong to a permanently oppressed class, and that the United States is built upon racist foundations.\n\nIn recent months, however, Americans growing sick of Critical Race Theory have begun to change the tides. Teachers are refusing to indoctrinate their classes with politicized ideological frameworks. Parents are organizing against leftism in school districts. Their efforts are having tangible results - as shown most recently by the Department of Education decision to back down from encouraging critical race theory in the nation's public schools.\n\nDespite evident victories, however, America still has a long way to go before it purges Critical Race Theory from its classrooms.\n\nHere are some of the worst examples.\n\nNew York - Nine-year-old activists\n\nFairport Central School District near Rochester, New York, placed fourth graders in \"restorative justice\" circles to learn about racism.\n\nUsing a racial justice curriculum developed by a consulting firm, students were encouraged to partake in activism and uproot racism in Rochester.\n\nAccording to materials obtained by The Daily Wire's Chrissy Clark , nine-year-olds must be able to \"understand, discuss, and identify examples of racism, segregation, and anti-racism.\" Students were shown pictures of children protesting as an example of \"anti-racism.\" The children's signs contain slogans like \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"None of us is free until all of us are free.\"\n\nAs an \"exit ticket\" idea for teachers, students could watch a video that would help them to \"reflect on how we as fourth graders can be antiracists\" and what \"problem(s) in our school or community [they] want to change.\" One example included an image of three young girls with the caption: \"Bailey, Khaliat, and Simra meeting with their principal to address their concerns about hiring more black teachers.\"\n\nTennessee - The Constitution is white supremacist\n\nVanderbilt University professors taught students that the United States Constitution is racist.\n\nAs reported by Campus Reform , a Vanderbilt course with over 800 participants asked students on a test whether the founding document was \"designed to perpetuate white supremacy.\"\n\nThe correct answer was \"true\" - and at least one student in the class lost points after answering \"false.\"\n\nOne Vanderbilt student explained to Campus Reform that professors included the question as a freebie: \"All of the quiz's answers would come directly from a recorded lecture... the questions were exact quotes from the lecture. Even if the student disagreed with the statement about the original writing of the Constitution, they obviously weren't paying attention to the lecture.\n\nVirginia - Whiteness and 'white culture'\n\nLeft-wing educators pushed Critical Race Theory in a small, conservative town near Richmond, Virginia.\n\nAs reported by The Federalist , Powhatan County Public Schools administrators tried to convince community members that teaching critical race theory was no more than a form of encouraging \"cultural competency.\"\n\nCounty Supervisor David Williams shared slides from the Virginia Inquiry Collaborative - a group that pushes teaching about the evils of \"white culture\" through the lens of \"systemic racism\" - during a June 22 school board meeting. The slides included the emblems of seven participating school districts.\n\nWilliams showcased a training slide deck entitled \"Construction of a Dominant Narrative: 'Whiteness,'\" which described race as \"not based on genetics,\" a \"social construction,\" and \"not 'real,'\" yet discussing consequences for the \"racialized.\" According to the slide, race \"was created to and remains the main tool for maintaining social, economic and educational inequality in the U.S. and beyond.\"\n\nCommunity members, understandably, were not thrilled.\n\n\"Why are we sending teachers to a conference to re-write Virginia history which focuses on whiteness and the color of someone's skin?\" asked resident Sarah Taylor. \"What does this have to do with curriculum in Powhatan County? What does this have to do with math and science? This idea of race being the predominant factor in curriculum has got to go.\"\n\nUtah - 'Microaggressions'\n\nUniversity of Utah staff members were subjected to a training about \"whiteness.\"\n\nAn educator provided a recording of the presentation to The Daily Wire's Georgia Howe , who reported that participants were informed that a comment or action can be considered a \"microaggression\" even if it is well-intended and causes no apparent harm.\n\nOne diversity instructor explained that a genuine compliment can be a microaggression even if the recipient was flattered by it, as long as the compliment in some way \"reinforces\" systems of power. For instance, phrases like \"You're so smart for 15!\" and \"Wow, you look great for your age!\" were provided as two obvious examples of microaggressions.\n\nOne female participant chimed in: \"People tell me I'm too successful to be so young\" and \"too ambitious.\"\n\n\"It's like, you can't be twenty-six years old and that well-spoken,\" she lamented. \"It's like, thanks ,\"  she added sarcastically, \"so that really hit home for me.\"\n\nFlorida - 'Social justice' summer camp\n\nThe University of North Florida launched a virtual \"social justice\" summer camp to \"create communities of young leaders and future teachers who know that education is an essential element in the fight against racism and oppression.\"\n\nCampus Reform reported that the program - \"Bridges Summer Camp\" - is designed for \"young adults who want to explore educational and community spaces from racial equity, social justice and activist perspectives.\"\n\nIn a video of students describing their favorite memories from their camp experience, one student says that he was impacted when an instructor told him \"if you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.\" Another student liked circle discussions - during which \"you can hear everyone's perspectives on different situations and questions.\"\n\nThe views expressed in this piece are the author's own and do not necessarily represent those of The Daily Wire.\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

      "text": "Debunking Critical Race Theory\n\nWhat Is Critical Race Theory?\n\nYou've heard that Critical Race Theory (CRT)  is \"just teaching history.\" Or that it's just a theory with no actual practical component. None of that is true. Critical Race Theory is a framework for thinking about the world with a clear component of practice. And that component means that the ideas of Critical Race Theory are to be leveraged into every area of American life - and in particular, education.\n\nCritical Race Theory is an outgrowth from the 1960s argument made by racial radicals that America's institutions were irrevocably shot through with racism, unfixable and worthy of destruction.\n\nRobert F. Williams, a thought leader whose writings influenced the Black Panther Party wrote:\n\nThe Afro-American militant is a 'militant' because he defends himself, his family, his home, and his dignity. He does not introduce violence into a racist social system - the violence is already there, and has always been there. It is precisely this unchallenged violence that allows a racist social system to perpetuate itself .\n\nMalcolm X famously echoed this sentiment in his writings:\n\n...At the same time we realized that we were black people in a white society. That we were black people in a racist society. We were black people in a society whose very political system was steeped and nourished upon racism. Whose social system was a racist system .\n\nIn the 1960s, such arguments were understandable if wrong: after all, many of our American institutions had been designed with discrimination in mind.\n\nJim Crow laws, for example, prevented black people from using the same public facilities as white people. From segregated water fountains, to separate schools, to the illegality of interractial marriage, there was in fact a different standard applied to black Americans in the not too distant past. Even voting rights for black Americans were different than for White Americans during this time.\n\nThe need for change was real, and the work of men like Martin Luther King Jr. was necessary. Who could possibly disagree with the fundamental civil rights he desired for all Americans?\n\nHe wrote, \"I have the audacity to believe that people everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality, and freedom for their spirits.\"\n\nNow, here is precisely the point where we can see the slight of hand used in Critical Race Theory. Like a skilled magician, the left hand draws all of your attention and focus onto the evils of America's past, so that the other hand can then begin the dirty work of convincing you that white superiority must therefore be an essential American ideal, when in fact, it is not.\n\nBut the key American ideals - ideals laid forth in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution - were not only NOT rooted in racism, they were ringing rejections of it.\n\nThe argument against American institutions, however, quickly merged with the argument that any institution resulting in disparate outcome had to itself be racist. This was ridiculous on its face. But it was the central component of what would become Critical Race Theory.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, Critical Race Theorists began to lay forth their main argument. Professors Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic set out the basic principles of CRT in their book, \"Critical Race Theory: An Introduction.\" The two most basic principles were:\n\nCritical Race Theory pioneer Derek Bell took the arguments of CRT to their logical conclusion. He wrote that \"the whole liberal worldview of private rights and public sovereignty mediated by the rule of law needed to be exploded . . . a worldview premised upon the public and private spheres is an attractive mirage that masks the reality of economic and political power.\"\n\nAccording to Bell, even purportedly good outcomes may be evidence of white supremacy implicit within the system - white people are so invested in the system, that if they have to do something purportedly racially tolerant to uphold it, they will. But in the end, it's all about upholding white power.\n\nNo wonder Bell posited that white Americans would sell black Americans to space aliens in order to alleviate the national debt - and suggested in 1992 that black Americans were more oppressed than at any time since the end of slavery. In fact, Bell went so far as to argue that Brown v. Board of Education was an attempt by the white patriarchy to reinforce racism for its own purposes.\n\nIn this view, the system is damned if it does and damned if it doesn't. Every time it does something purportedly anti-racist, it upholds itself, and thus upholds racism; every time it does something that ends in disparate outcome, it demonstrates its own racism. The only solution is to tear everything down.\n\nThis is why the Smithsonian Institute, in the middle of the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests and riots, put out an online exhibit condemning \"whiteness.\" The exhibit, titled \"Aspects & Assumptions of Whiteness & White Culture in the United States,\" explained that Americans had internalized aspects of white culture. What were these terribly white cultural barriers posing challenges to nonwhites? According to the exhibit, \"rugged individualism\" was a white concept, rooted in nasty ideas like \"the individual is the primary unit,\" \"independence & autonomy highly valued + rewarded,\" and \"individuals assumed to be in control of their environment.\" \"Family structure\" represented another white concept, with \"the nuclear family\" condemned as an aspect of whiteness, along with the notion that children \"should be independent.\" Other irrevocably white ideas included an \"emphasis on scientific method,\" complete with \"cause and effect relationships\"; a focus on history, including \"the primacy of Western (Greek, Roman) and Judeo-Christian tradition\"; a belief that \"hard work is the key to success\" and encouragement of \"work before play\"; monotheism; placing emphasis on \"delayed gratification\" and following \"rigid time schedules\"; justice rooted in English common law and intent and private property; \"decision-making\" and \"action orientation\"; and, of course, \"be[ing] polite.\"\n\nCRT isn't just another theory. It's a call to action. Delgado and Stefancic openly stated in 2011 that they were happy that CRT had infused the education system: \"Seeing Critical Race Theory take off in education has been a source of great satisfaction for the two of us. Critical Race Theory is in some ways livelier in education right now than it is in law, where it is a mature movement that has settled down by comparison.\" CRT thinkers - the intellectual line continues all the way down to Ibram X. Kendi and Nikole Hannah-Jones - argue that in order to be \"anti-racist\" one must target \"racist\" institutions, which can be defined as any institution with a racially disparate result. Kendi says, \"A racist policy is any measure that produces or sustains racial inequity between racial groups. An antiracist policy is any measure that produces or sustains racial equity between racial groups.... There is no such thing as a non-racist or race-neutral policy.\" Robin DiAngelo, Kendi's white woke counterpart and a professor at the University of Washington, summarizes: \"if we truly believe that all humans are equal, then disparity in condition can only be the result of systemic discrimination.\"\n\nAll of this has boiled itself down to the term \"equity\" for the Left. The substitution of the word \"equity\" for equality is a semantic game, a trick to avoid the obvious: equality of rights does not mean equality of outcome. But \"equity\" suggests that any disparity is evidence of discrimination. And \"equity\" has now infused the Biden administration.\n\nOn the day of his inauguration, Biden signed an executive order \"on advancing racial equity,\" decrying \"the unbearable human cost of systemic racism,\" and saying that it was the policy of the administration \"that the Federal Government should pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all.\" This would require \"a systemic approach to embedding fairness in decision-making processes.\"\n\nCRT is not a vague, non-threatening idea. It isn't just \"teaching history.\" It's a view of America that is thoroughly perverse.\n\nThis piece is adapted from an episode of Ben's series, Debunked, available exclusively to Daily Wire Members.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion piece are the author's own and do not necessarily represent those of The Daily Wire.\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

      "text": "Academics Call For Critical Race Theory To Be Taught In Kindergarten, Warn Of Racist 3 Year Olds\n\nEven kindergarteners are said to develop racial biases, the guide on Critical Race Theory says\n\nAcademics and activists teamed up to create a guide to teaching Critical Race Theory (CRT) to young children, arguing that kids exhibit racial bias from as young as three years old.\n\nTitled \"Reflections on Children's Racial Learning,\" the guide was created by a leftist organization called EmbraceRace , and shares strategies to effectively inculcate liberal beliefs on race among young children. It was written in part by professors at prominent universities such as the University of North Carolina and Wake Forest University, who urge parents to have \"courageous conversations about race\" with their toddlers.\n\n\"Children will 'naturally' grow up to be non-racist adults only when they live in a non-racist society. Until then, adults must guide children's anti-racist development,\" the guide argues, adding that \"we have far to go before the US can be considered a 'non-racist society.'\" It also claimed that \"by about 3-4 years old ... white children generally show clear pro-White biases.\"\n\nEmbraceRace, the organization behind the guide, claims that \"children's racial sensibilities begin to form in infancy\" and that kids \"develop racial and other biases by kindergarten.\" EmbraceRace bemoans that most \"racial learning\" doesn't take place until middle or high school, and exists to provide resources for \"early and elementary childhood educators.\"\n\nThe guide was slammed by parent's rights activists who oppose the politicization of education.\n\n\"Any individual or group trying to claim babies can be 'racist' has ceded any pretense to be taken seriously. At three-and four-years-old, children should be learning their numbers, letters, and basic social skills, not racially charged content that is being pushed on them by radical organizations looking to enrich themselves through race-baiting,\" said Michele Exner, the Senior Adviser at Parents Defending Education, a grassroots organization opposed to Critical Race Theory and gender theory in America's schools.\n\nThe push to teach Critical Race Theory (CRT) to young children comes amid a wider national battle over the ideology and its presence in American schools. The doctrine has been found in K-12 schools across the country, where educators have taught children that America is systematically racist, white people enjoy privilege on account of their race, and that differences in outcomes between groups can be attributed to bigotry and discrimination.\n\nConservative activists and politicians have mounted an opposition to the ideology, barring schools from teaching it in at least 18 different states .\n\nThe guide from EmbraceRace addresses the conservative pushback to CRT, characterizing it as a force of \"racial regression\" that has managed to successfully \"capture the headlines\" before saying that a \"color-brave countercurrent is gathering momentum!\"\n\nThe guide also doubles down on its support of CRT, stating that \"recent eruptions about 'critical race theory' make clear that the work of educators to engage children in honest, constructive learning about race and racism is far from over - and more vital than ever.\"\n\nIt goes on to offer specific ways in which parents and teachers alike can most effectively push CRT on young children. In a portion of the report subtitled, \"'They're Not Too Young To Talk About Race:' The Science of Early Racial Learning,\" an activist with EmbraceRace argues that \"racial biases are often formed by the preschool and kindergarten years,\" going on to point to a development chart that went viral on the organization's social media accounts and claims that \"silence about race reinforces racism.\"\n\nOther activists shared their methods of inculcating CRT in children, with an organization called \"We Are\" discussing the \"anti-racist summer camps\" that they've held since 2016.\n\n\"One of our approaches to dismantling systemic racism in education is offering summer camps for children in rising 1st - 5th grade,\" the guide reads. \"In these camps we have trained anti-racist educators helping children build healthy racial identities by teaching them about race, racism, its impact on communities, and how to actively resist racism in our communities.\"\n\nAn entry from Dr. Michael Rizzo, an Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, argues that children should be taught about structural racism as part of a broader plan for parents to raise \"anti-racist children.\"\n\nOne portion of the guide, titled \"New Directions for Anti-Racism Research: White Children's Understanding of Structural Racism,\" reads \"research points toward teaching about structural racism as a way to promote more antiracist worldviews in early childhood.\"\n\nAnother entry in the guide, called \"Nurturing Children's Racial Learning One Talk at a Time,\" was written by academics at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and Wake Forest University. The portion urges parents to prepare their children to \"handle racialized moments and be change agents in their environments\" by having \"courageous conversations about race.\"\n\nEmbraceRace, the non-profit behind the guide, is funded by the Proteus Fund , a massive funding apparatus for leftist groups in pursuit of \"racial, gender, queer, and disability justice\" as well as \"an inclusive, fully-representative democracy.\" The Amherst, Massachusetts-based fund received a whopping $178 million in contributions from 2017 to 2021 and its president, a white man named Paul Di Donato, was paid more than $290,000 in 2021.\n\nDi Donato is a prolific donor to Democrat candidates and causes, including the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Elizabeth Warren, as well as the campaigns of Senators John Fetterman, Raphael Warnock, and Jon Ossoff, among others.\n\nParents Defending Education's Exner said the guide was \"a joke\" that \"should not be taken seriously by any professional connected to children's education.\"\n\n\"Over the past three years, the proof we have seen is that DEI and CRT initiatives have been complete disasters and do not belong in schools,\" Exner said.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "SHAPIRO: The Movement Against Critical Race Theory Is Deeply Necessary\n\nAccording to the establishment media, critical race theory, or CRT, is a distraction. It is a right-wing smear. It is a conservative attempt to quash the dark side of American history. Most of all, according to the establishment media, you must never - ever - pay attention to the infusion of CRT into the nation's institutions of power. According to MSNBC's Chuck Todd, controversy over CRT is a \"creation ... It keeps people watching or it keeps people clicking.\" According to CNN's Bakari Sellers, CRT is just \"America's history.\" According to The Washington Post's Jonathan Capehart, those who criticize CRT are merely attempting to prevent \"us from learning our history.\"\n\nCritical race theory, of course, is not America's actual history. It is a perverse worldview, unsupportable by the evidence, in which all of America's key institutions are inextricably rooted in white supremacy; it is an activist campaign demanding the destruction of those institutions. The founders of CRT have written as much. According to CRT founders Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic, CRT is founded on two key premises: that \"racism is ordinary, not aberrational - 'normal science,' the usual way society does business, the common, everyday experience of most people of color in this country\"; second, that \"our system of white-over-color ascendancy serves important purposes, both psychic and material.\" This means, according to Delgado and Stefancic, that \"racism is difficult to cure or address\" and that a formal commitment to legal equality on the basis of color-blindness is merely a guise for further discrimination. Furthermore, CRT founders say that whites are unable to understand racism, and that \"minority status ... brings with it a presumed competence to speak about race and racism.\"\n\nCRT therefore holds that racism is embedded deeply in American life, unconsciously into white American psyches, and that it is impossible for white Americans to understand their own racism or that of the system, let alone to remove it. The only solution: tearing away the only systems that have ever provided widespread liberty and prosperity. As fellow CRT founder Derrick Bell wrote, \"The whole liberal worldview of private rights and public sovereignty mediated by the rule of law needed to be exploded.\"\n\nCRT isn't merely a tool of legal analysis, either, as many of its dishonest defenders claim. Delgado and Stefancic are clear: \"Although CRT began as a movement in the law, it has rapidly spread beyond that discipline. Today, many in the field of education consider themselves critical race theorists ... Political scientists ponder voting strategies coined by critical race theorists ... Unlike some academic disciplines, critical race theory contains an activist dimension.\"\n\nSo, what has CRT accomplished? The near-complete subjugation of our higher educational system, which now traffics regularly in CRT-related theories; the corruption of our establishment media, who parrot the anti-Americanism of CRT as \"just history\"; the infusion of CRT into nearly every area of the government, under the Biden-esque Newspeak of \"equity.\" And yet, if Americans notice this - if Americans lobby school boards to bar indoctrination in the cultish nonsense of CRT - these institutional actors tell those Americans that there is nothing to see.\n\nThe grassroots pushback against CRT is rooted in the best of the American tradition: a rejection of racial essentialism in favor of individualism, an enthusiastic endorsement of agency rather than determinism, a willingness to stand united against tribalism. We all ought to fight those who have hijacked and weaponized our institutions against all of these traditionally American ideals. Anything less would be an abdication of the trust we have been given - a trust that has resulted in liberty, equality and prosperity beyond imagining for nearly all of human history.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion piece are the author's own and do not necessarily represent those of The Daily Wire.\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

      "text": "The Smart Lawmaker's Guide To Writing Anti-Critical Race Theory Laws That Will Stand Up In Court\n\nAn ideal solution is to close unserious departments, end lower-priority programs, and stop teaching frivolous courses across the board.\n\nThe fight against critical race theory in schools, colleges, and companies took a leap forward in December 2021, when Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced a legislative proposal to prohibit discriminatory teaching and training around the state. Although he signed the bill into law in April, a federal judge last month found key clauses of the Individual Freedom Act, also known as the Stop W.O.K.E. Act, to be unconstitutional with respect to higher education. But that does not mean the fight is over.\n\nThe offending clauses prevented faculty members from giving any student instruction \"that espouses, promotes, advances, inculcates, or compels [belief in]\" a range of discriminatory concepts, such as the concept that one race is morally superior to another.\n\nJudge Mark E. Walker acknowledged that the state or its universities may establish a curriculum - content-based requirements for college courses. Academic freedom, he wrote , \"does not justify a professor hijacking their class discussion to focus on matters outside the established curriculum.\" But regarding the viewpoints expressed within that content, he decided, the legislation unconstitutionally restricted positive teachings about the concepts while permitting neutral or negative teachings.\n\nThe Florida law was one of many nationwide that were advertised not merely as anti-discrimination but also as anti-critical race theory (CRT), a worldview that promotes racial prejudice.\n\nWhat is next for legislation that promotes colorblindness and meritocracy in higher education? What lawful options remain for colleges and universities?\n\nToo many proposals against CRT have been based on viewpoint - seeking to sanction individuals for teaching or discussing CRT, rather than acting on it. It's the action that creates discrimination. Legislative proposals should not interfere with the academic freedom to have robust discussions in class. They should, however, target prejudicial behavior, such as establishing and supporting restrictive affinity groups, holding mandatory student orientation or residence life activities including \"privilege walks,\" and mandating diversity trainings in which participants must confess some allegedly inherent bias.\n\nAnti-CRT proscriptions for higher education banning such behavior, without requiring colleges to crack down on any viewpoint, have better prospects. So do interventions in the curriculum.\n\nThe Florida case may have proceeded differently if the prohibition were narrowly tailored to anti-discrimination and anti-harassment as applied to speech. In Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education (1999), the Supreme Court provided a standard for this: the victim must be subjected to conduct so severe, pervasive, offensive, and unwanted that the victim is effectively denied equal access to education.\n\nAccordingly, an anti-harassment rationale for restricting CRT must be limited to situations where a postsecondary student is denied access to a class or another education program or activity unless the student agrees with, or expresses agreement with, a discriminatory statement. Being kept out of a course, or being coerced to express belief in a discriminatory concept as a condition of the course, would meet the Davis standard.\n\nIn addition, legislation (or regulations at the state or university level) could list discriminatory teachings among the examples of discrimination and harassment within relevant policies. Such lists are already common. The lists are likely constitutional, however, only if they reassure readers that the listed speech must also meet the Davis standard of conduct (or a somewhat looser standard in a professional context). As the judge in the Florida case noted, disguising speech prohibitions within anti-discrimination rules does not work.\n\nThe anti-indoctrination, anti-harassment rationale for restricting CRT teachings provides relief but only in a narrow, rare set of situations.\n\nA public college cannot and should not control the viewpoints expressed in the classroom. Instead, a public college or a state legislature should assert its prerogative over the content of the curriculum at various levels.\n\nConsider the subject of astrology. It would be reasonable for a department of astronomy, its university, or its state legislature to make a determination that astrology readings are an unserious waste of time. Accordingly, campus policy or the law may require that there be no assigned astrology texts, no astrology units, and no astrology courses at the university. None of this would prevent astrology from being discussed in the classroom incidentally, from any viewpoint. The point is that it will have no place in the regular curriculum.\n\nThe same is true for other subjects, including CRT. A college department, a university, or a legislature may, as a matter of content and careful judgment, either require or prohibit modules, units, and courses on any topic. Further, the university or the legislature might determine that an entire program or department is not sufficiently valuable to receive scarce resources.\n\nTo operationalize this prerogative, consider that the faculty of a department often must approve the content of a course before a faculty member is allowed to teach it. Before it goes in the course catalog, the course often must be cleared by various academic bodies and administrators. It is perfectly legitimate for legislatures and trustees to require that unserious topics (CRT, astrology, etc.) not be approved for courses, while recognizing that any topic might come up in the course of normal class discussion anyway.\n\nEnforcement need not be draconian. Defining a subject matter such as \"biology\" or \"psychology\" or \"CRT\" can be difficult. Fields overlap and change over time. But this situation presents no legal difficulty for restricting CRT as described here, since no institution will be interfering with the classroom or a student, and courts normally defer to the professional judgment of scholars in determining the enforcement of academic norms. Legislators will not be judging courses or course materials once they set the curriculum as they think best.\n\nIn other words, scholars and legislators know what astrology is; they know what CRT is, and they know what other subjects are, more or less, despite hard cases and indeterminate borders.\n\nEven when a topic is serious and worth students' time, not every college needs to teach or offer a degree in every subject. A college or legislature need not determine that CRT is an unserious waste of time. Instead, the college or legislature may determine merely that CRT is not a high enough priority, and accordingly that CRT fits no module, unit, or course, and that no resources will be used to buy library books in that subject area.\n\nAn ideal solution, then, is to close unserious departments, end lower-priority programs, and stop teaching frivolous courses across the board. CRT is far from the only low-value topic taught at most universities, as critics of higher education have pointed out for nearly a century.\n\nSo long as public colleges exist, there will be democratic pressures regarding what to teach and what not to teach. A completely privatized, competitive ecosystem of higher education would be democratic in a different way; students would vote with their tuition dollars. Until that time, legislatures have a responsibility to ensure that the people's scarce dollars are well spent.\n\nDetermining institutional priorities is a core responsibility of institutions of higher education. When public colleges fail to do that work effectively, it is appropriate for legislatures to fill the gap.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "How Critical Race Theory Bred American Leftists' Jew Hatred\n\nCritical race theory teaches that support for Israel is an extension of Jewish 'privilege' and influence in America.\n\nSince the terrorist attack of Oct. 7, the war in Gaza has captivated the attention of the American public. As a result, interest in the conflict has quickly manifested into yet another theater in America's greater culture war.\n\nAmerican views on the war in Gaza have become increasingly centered around issues of diversity here in our own country. A large contingent of protesters and Palestinian sympathizers see and even openly acknowledge that they are in fact fighting to dismantle Jewish \"privilege\" in America and the system that supports it.\n\nWhen a campus protester at an American college dons a veil and holds up a \"Free Hamas\" sign, their intention is clear. It is to criticize not only the actions of the Israeli government but the larger system of \"settler colonialism\" and the Jewish community's role in its supposed perpetuation.\n\nMeanwhile, when a Jewish student rightly calls out a protester for being antisemitic, he becomes, in the eyes of the protester, a representative of a system that is unfairly and structurally pro-Jewish - and, in turn, pro-white - at its core.\n\nBlack left-wingers use the images of Jews as \"white\" and Palestinians as \"dark\" to compare America's exploitation of blacks to Israel's treatment of Gaza, which they regard as genocidal. Rapper SEB! exploited this comparison in his song FREE PALESTINE! - released in 2023 and played repeatedly on Yale University student commons.\n\nF-ck Israel, Israel a b-tch / B-tch we out here mobbin' on some Palestine sh-t / Free Palestine b-tch, Israel gon' die b-tch / N-gga its they land why you out here tryna rob it / Bullsh-t prophets, y'all just want the profit\n\n\"Robbing\" land? \"Want the profit?\" The rapper channels resentment against the notion that Jews in America are primarily devoted to the almighty dollar rather than the social welfare of their country. In this sense, left-wing campus activism follows the European anti-Jewish tradition, which has historically drummed up accusations against Jews for using their wealth in the service of undue influence on governments.\n\nAlarmingly, this anti-Jewish sentiment has grown increasingly popular among a diverse spectrum of the American population.\n\n\"Palestine is Arab,\" shouted protesters in New York City, seeking to deny the Arabness of Israeli Jews and reflecting long-held, open anti-Jewish views of many younger Americans. A 2021 study by the Anti-Defamation League revealed that at least 40 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 30 believe between two and five statements revealing strong beliefs about Jewish power and privilege - which is the same percentage of Americans over 30 who believe the same. Youth and a supposedly more \"progressive\" education are not eliminating anti-Jewish sentiment; they are fanning the flames.\n\nThese anti-Jewish sentiments, built upon theories of racial power and privilege, are a direct product of critical race theory. For instance, prior to protests by the Jewish community, California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum omitted Jewish Americans as ethnic minorities. Diversity trainers in California claimed famously that only \"Jews of color\" were supported under their diversity framework.\n\nSimmering anti-Jewish resentment also plays out in campus protesters' reaction against administrative actions used against them, which they claim are unfairly harsh and influenced by Jewish donors. Pro-Palestine publications like the Middle East Monitor published accounts of \"Pro-Israel Jewish Billionaires\" using their campaign and university donations as cudgels to influence the university's policy on protests.\n\nYounger anti-Jewish campus activism has also received support from older Middle Eastern immigrants to the United States. Seventy-three-year-old Palestinian businessman Mustafa Khader said pro-Palestine protests are \"totally American\" because they represent the value of free speech in America to criticize.\n\n\"I might differ with Hamas on their ideological beliefs,\" he also says, distancing himself from the terrorist group. \"But I cannot condemn Hamas for what they're doing. They're part of the oppressed population and an oppressed population and occupied population have by law, the right to resist, by all means possible.\"\n\n\"My understanding is that Palestinian hate for Jews is bred in the bone, taught in the schools and fortified by their leaders,\" writes Naomi Levine, a Jewish Winnipeg lawyer. It is the same story in America. Anti-Israel protests are buttressed and fortified by the idea that Jews control America, to the detriment of less powerful and oppressed minorities.\n\nBoth sides are starting to acknowledge more and more that criticism of Israel is interrelated to criticism of Jews in America. To get to the heart of the campus protests over Israel, look on the inside of our country, which encases the conflict in the lens of privilege and oppression and identifies the heart of privilege squarely in the American Jewry.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Where Are Teachers Getting Critical Race Theory? In Teachers' Colleges\n\nThe critical race racket has become nearly ubiquitous in American education, as shown by the recent embrace of this radical ideology by America's two largest teachers unions, the National Education Association (NEA) and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT).\n\nAs Jason Riley of the Wall Street Journal reports , \"[a]t its annual meeting earlier this month, the NEA adopted a proposal stating that it is 'reasonable and appropriate for curriculum to be informed by academic frameworks for understanding and interpreting the impact of the past on current society, including critical race theory.'\" The NEA also vowed to \"'fight back against anti-CRT rhetoric' and issue a study that 'critiques empire, white supremacy, anti-Blackness, anti-Indigeneity, racism, patriarchy, cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism, and other forms of power and oppression at the intersections of our society.'\"\n\nAs Riley notes, the AFT has similarly embraced this radical orthodoxy sweeping academe, partnering with \"Ibram X. Kendi, an activist-scholar who openly embraces racial discrimination against whites.\" Riley points out the perverse irony of Kendi's assertion in \"How to be an Anti-Racist\" that \"[t]he only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.\" Some \"anti-racism,\" indeed.\n\nThe teachers unions' embrace of a radical ideology that until only recently was the preserve of faculty lounges at elite liberal arts colleges shows just how quickly this worldview has become mainstream - not only in leftist circles, but increasingly, in elementary and secondary education as well. The great work of Heather MacDonald and Christopher Rufo in exposing the seepage of this pernicious doctrine into academia, corporate America, and even the military has shown just how rapidly CRT has come to dominate the national discourse.\n\nThis, despite gaslighting from the likes of AFT President Randi Weingarten, who claimed simultaneously that CRT is not being promulgated in America's schools while pledging to defend, in a court of law if necessary, those teaching it.\n\nTo better understand how far CRT has been embedded into American education, we viewed more than a dozen webinars and lectures by leading social justice educators, CRT proponents, legal scholars, and elementary and secondary educators. They included: \"How to Use the Books You Choose: Elevating the Status of Marginalized Identities in Children's Literature through Classroom Teaching,\" a February 9 webinar hosted by Boston University's Wheelock College of Education; \"Anti-Racist Teaching Practice,\" a November 2020 webinar hosted by California State at Fullerton; \"White Fragility,\" a lecture by Robin DiAngelo (author of the noted book of the same name) hosted by the Family Action Network; and \"Impacts of Racism on PK-12 Classrooms,\" a February 2021 University of Iowa anti-racism professional development webinar series.\n\nThe lectures ran the gamut geographically and covered education at every level, from pre-kindergarten to the graduate level. What they revealed was nothing short of pure indoctrination. To fully appreciate the destructive quality of intersectional education - particularly in early childhood, when minds are malleable and nuance and perspective are elusive - we highlight what until recently few outside conservative think tanks seemed to fully appreciate: Critical race theory is being adopted in education at the earliest possible age with remarkable zeal.\n\nSeveral of the webinars we viewed, including those sponsored by the Wheelock School of Education, were designed for elementary educators. It's worth stressing that, lest one harbor any doubts about where American education is headed ideologically, these are programs that \"teach the teachers.\" What stood out is the nearly universal calls to radically transform, restructure, and reimagine curricula at every level to reflect critical race theory.\n\nTake for example \"Teaching History for Justice,\" an April 30, 2021, webinar from Wheelock with Kaylene Stevens, program director for social studies education at Wheelock, and Chris Martell, assistant professor of social studies education at the University of Massachusetts Boston, co-authors of \"Teaching History for Justice, Centering Activism in Students' Study of the Past\" (Teachers College Press, 2020). The webinar highlights the need to reorganize how social studies and history are taught.\n\nFor them, the \"powerful individual\"-based approach to teaching history, whereby students learn about leaders from Julius Caesar to Abraham Lincoln who have shaped history, is not only flawed but irredeemably grounded in white supremacy. What, then, should emerge to take its place?\n\nFor Stevens and Martell, the traditional approach must be supplanted by a movement-centered curriculum, one grounded in activist thinking , with the goal of encouraging students to become activists at the earliest possible age. Traditional models of instruction that aim to teach students to \"think like a historian\" or \"think like a democratic citizen\" are inherently lacking; they must be supplemented with \"thinking like an activist.\"\n\nFigures they tell teachers are worthy of study, all cited approvingly, include Angela Davis (described as an \"activist for racial and gender equity and democracy,\" a \"prison abolitionist,\" and member of the Black Panther and Communist parties) and Marsha P. Johnson (an activist for queer and trans law and founding member of the Gay Liberation Front and Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries). If only Caesar had been an activist.\n\nWhat's more, Stevens and Martell ridicule a 19th-century history textbook that deigned to praise Lincoln as \"one of the greatest of men.\" Even more disturbingly, the authors lament that their book's recommendations only begin with kindergarten, since anti-racist work would ideally start in early childhood settings.\n\nFinally, sources with which students engage should rely less heavily on written texts and more on oral history and artifacts to better capture certain communities. The upshot of this new mode of instruction is more activism and indoctrination and less rigor - all at the earliest possible age. But don't worry, they're quick to remind us that \"Teaching History for Justice\" is \"political but not partisan.\" One can only help but wonder if some forms of activism are more encouraged than others.\n\nAs if this new mode of instruction is not bad enough, the luminaries at Boston University also determined that children's books can be harnessed for CRT indoctrination. In a seminar entitled \"How to Use the Books You Choose: Elevating the Status of Marginalized Identities in Children's Literature through Classroom Teaching,\" Dr. Andrea Bien and Dr. Laura Jiménez explain the emotional damage visited upon primary school-aged children -  particularly those that belong to \"underrepresented\" groups - due to a lack of self-representation in children's literature.\n\nJiménez states, \"As a Latina lesbian, I did not see myself reflected in a book until I was 47 years old. . . . What that tells me is that my experience, my identity, my place in the world is not worthy of inclusion in literature.\" To right this supposed wrong, the speakers posit that including more politically correct stories in children's curricula must only come with the erasure of what they consider to be harmful or outdated books.\n\nTo the speakers, \"The Rainbow Fish,\" a children's classic used by teachers nationwide to teach our youth about the values of friendship and sharing with others, ought to be promptly removed from classrooms. Why? Because the protagonist of the story decides to share his colorful scales-his unique and defining characteristic-with others as a token of friendship.\n\nFor Bien and Jiménez, this is not a kind and selfless act, but a harmful message to any child who does not fit the supposed societal norm that they must \"mutilate\" themselves to fit in. In the opinion of the speakers, the societal norm in the United States of America excludes any person that is not \"white, straight, cis, Christian, male, and able[bodied].\"  \"The Rainbow Fish\" is, unfortunately, a singular example in this seminar's hour-long crusade to reshape children's literature in the United States for an alleged lack of attention to racial identities.\n\nMake no mistake. The purpose of this seminar and countless others like it isn't to simply engage in friendly discussion or debate. Rather, the purpose is to influence teachers from coast to coast to fundamentally reconstruct what and how America's children are taught in schools.\n\nWhat stood out as most striking across the board is how brazen social justice \"educators\" are in their calls for the transformation of America's elementary education into little more than social justice bootcamps, while union leaders and liberal elected officials vociferously deny that CRT is being taught at all. After all, several of these \"experts\" contend that to refrain from this method of teaching is to set down a \"hidden\" or \"implicit\" curriculum, a tacit narrative inculcated by not teaching what ought to be taught. The message is clear: Teach this nonsense or you are complicit in oppression - or worse.\n\nAnother example of this weaponization of elementary education for ideological ends was a social justice webinar hosted by Be GLAD, a self-described \"national organization providing professional development to states, districts, and schools\" serving as \"a professional development model in the area of academic language acquisition and literacy.\" Perhaps most concerning, Be GLAD boasts the imprimatur of being a \"U.S. Department of Education Program of Academic Excellence.\"\n\nDesigned to train elementary school teachers in social justice education, the webinar covered the usual topics of \"systemic racism\" and \"microaggressions,\" toeing the leftist line that virtually every facet of American life is saturated in racism - from the banking and housing systems, to criminal justice, public health, and education. Calls for \"systemic anti-racism,\" a supposed panacea for these ills, include some familiar appeals to \"[d]ismantle[] barriers,\" and some novel ones perhaps unfamiliar to a lay (read: \"rational\") audience, such as \"[d]ecolonization of the mind.\" Well, that's a tall order for 7-year-olds.\n\nMost jarring of all is how the presenters lauded the use of a \"Black Lives Matter Process Grid,\" in which students map out their identities, presented in tabular form and replete with corresponding lists of those with a \"power advantage\" (unsurprisingly straight, white, Christian males) and those with \"oppressed disadvantage,\" broken down by age, social class, gender, race, ethnicity, language, ability, sexual orientation, and religion.\n\nIn nearly every webinar reviewed, the presenters go out of their way to dismiss the idea that this methodology constitutes indoctrination. It goes without saying that encouraging teachers to educate that colorblindness is inherently racist and that diversity can be oppressive hardly encourages independent thought.\n\nSadly, this approach seems to be working. For example, in a webinar hosted by Cal State Fullerton's College of Education entitled \"Anti-Racist Teaching Practice,\" speaker Monique Marshall, an elementary school teacher, presented the audience a video clip of a 6-year-old student. In the video, when asked to define his \"multicultural identity,\" the young boy began his response by stating that the color of his skin defined his \"outside identity,\" which elicited smiles from the presenting speakers.\n\nTo be clear, there are people with whom we trust the education of our youth who actively encourage children to view the color of their skin as an individual's defining characteristic, thus dividing their students along the lines of race and identity. A far cry from \"not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\" After all, for CRT enthusiasts, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s noble aspiration is not merely impractical but a concession to injustice and oppression.\n\nSo where does this leave us? These seminars and workshops show CRT is no longer \"fringe\" but is well within the mainstream of elementary and secondary education. It's no longer confined to post-secondary and graduate levels.\n\nTherefore, recent grassroots efforts to combat this dangerous ideology are imperative. They symbolize that parents are finally giving the issue the attention it deserves.\n\nWhile it may provide a minute's solace that the Biden administration's Department of Education removed express references to CRT from its July 19 notice in the Federal Register soliciting grant applications, these seminars demonstrate that American educators don't need the government's encouragement to import these views into the classroom. CRT is in the pipeline, and doesn't seem to be going anywhere anytime soon.\n\nContinuing to expose its advance is necessary so American elementary and secondary education can escape the grips of a worldview that, despite its professed aim of racial progress, is deeply flawed and divisive.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "No, Critical Race Theory Isn't About Teaching That 'Slavery Is Real'\n\nParents who oppose teaching critical race theory in schools have nothing against teaching America's checkered history of race relations.\n\nProminent voices continue to frame the debate over whether critical race theory (CRT) should be taught in schools as a debate over whether we should teach accurate racial history.\n\nA few days ago, in an interview with Time magazine, Harvard University researcher Donald Yacovone (author of \"Teaching White Supremacy: America's Democratic Ordeal and the Forging of Our National Identity\") said of the controversy: \"...one of the major reactions is this resistance to the teaching of the past. ... Slavery is real. Racial domination is real. But they're doing their best to deny it, to affirm the innocence of whiteness.\"\n\nThis is a strawman attack. Few Americans of any stripe or generation object to teaching about slavery and Jim Crow. The problem with CRT in schools is there's a lot more to it than just teaching America's checkered history of race relations, and it's this \"more\" that many parents are objecting to.\n\nFor starters, CRT is essentially postmodernism. Stephen Sawchuk, associate editor of Education Week, notes in a piece praising CRT that, \"Critical race theory emerged out of postmodernist thought.\"\n\nPostmodernism is the idea that there is no truth, no universal morality, and no reality except what we create. There are no facts because everything is socially constructed. According to the Encyclopedia Brittanica's entry on postmodernism, it dismisses as \"naive realism\" the idea that \"there is an objective natural reality.\"\n\nPostmodernism is the philosophical equivalent of a funhouse mirror. Anything can be changed, created, and thrown away; and any new narrative is no more or less true than other narratives; because there is no such thing as objective fact or objective reality.\n\nThis philosophy comes through clearly in the works of critical race theorists such as Robin DiAngelo and Ozlem Sensoy, who reject the idea of objective knowledge and the scientific method in their book, \" Is Everyone Really Equal? \"\n\nImportantly for American parents, postmodernism and CRT take careful aim at the Enlightenment values that America was founded on, including the idea that all humans are created equal.\n\nSawchuk points out how postmodernism (and by extension CRT), \"tends to be skeptical of the idea of universal values, objective knowledge, individual merit, Enlightenment rationalism, and liberalism.\"\n\nIn her classes on intersectionality (itself an offshoot of CRT), the late Kathryn Pauly Morgan, who was a University of Toronto professor of philosophy and co-founder of the feminist philosophy journal Hypatia, taught that people exist on 14 axes of privilege and oppression: from male to female, from white to non-white, from heterosexual to gay/lesbian, etc.\n\nThat is, a white male lives at the intersection of two types of privilege, a black female lives at the intersection of two types of oppression, and so on. As she described it, \"Privilege involves the power to dominate in systematic ways. ... Oppression involves the lived, systematic experience of being dominated by virtue of one's position on various particular axes.\"\n\nThis kind of teaching can help open our eyes to the experiences of people unlike us, but it can also function to create a hierarchy. In their bestselling book \"The Coddling of the American Mind,\" social psychologist Jonathan Haidt and Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression President Greg Lukianoff point out, \"These interpretations of intersectionality teach people to see bipolar dimensions of privilege and oppression as ubiquitous in social interactions.\"\n\n\"More generally,\" they continue, \"what will happen to the thinking of students who are trained to see everything in terms of intersecting bipolar axes where one end of each axis is marked 'privilege' and the other is 'oppression'? Since 'privilege' is defined as the 'power to dominate' and to cause 'oppression,' these axes are inherently moral dimensions. The people on top are bad, and the people below the line are good.\" [emphasis in original]\n\nMaybe some parents are upset that critical race theory doesn't put white people on top. We suspect far more are angry at an ideology that puts any skin color on top, rather than treating them all as equals. That's a denial of the core American tenant espoused in the Declaration of Independence, that all men are created equal - and one that Americans of many generations fought to ultimately realize.\n\nBesides jettisoning a foundational American tenet, it's also important to note CRT isn't \"educational\" in the traditional sense.\n\nWhile CRT teaches students what to think, it's openly hostile toward approaches that teach students how to think. In fact, many CRT advocates explicitly reject the concept of critical thinking altogether.\n\nDr. Alison Bailey, the director of the Women's and Gender Studies Program at Illinois State University, spells out the logic :\n\n...the tools of the critical-thinking tradition (for example, validity, soundness, conceptual clarity) cannot dismantle the master's house: they can temporarily beat the master at his own game, but they can never bring about any enduring structural change (Lorde 1984, 112). They fail because the critical thinker's toolkit is commonly invoked in particular settings, at particular times to reassert power: those adept with the tools often use them to restore an order that assures their comfort.\n\nBailey's argument boils down to this: Some people can outthink us, and those people might have power; so if we're going to dismantle power structures (a key goal of CRT and postmodernism), then we need to reject critical thinking completely.\n\nApart from the bare-knuckle politics of all this and the argument's self-evident absurdity, is a tool really bad because it's used by those in power? It's not hard to see the problems of introducing these ideas in K-12 schools. Most parents want their kids to learn how to think. They might be justifiably wary of an ideology that teaches that critical thinking is bad because it doesn't bring about systemic change in society.\n\nIt's not just Bailey, it must be pointed out. Plenty of CRT advocates reject objectivism and Enlightenment rationalism. In their book \"Is Everyone Really Equal?,\" DiAngelo and Sensoy even take aim at  the scientific method: \"Critical Theory [the parent philosophy of critical race theory] developed in part as a response to this presumed superiority and infallibility of the scientific method....\"\n\nIf you reject the basic concepts of scientific inquiry and critical thinking, what are you left with? A strong focus on scholarship as activism, which filters down into pedagogy: CRT advocates often see their classrooms as incubators to raise a new generation to fight the system.\n\nMaybe parents who reject CRT being taught in schools are simply picking up on this. Perhaps they want their kids to be educated in how to think, instead of being indoctrinated and trained to be future social justice advocates.\n\nFinally, it's unlikely that the opposition to teaching CRT in schools actually comes from racism. Support for interracial marriage, often used as a proxy for race relations, is at an all-time high . Ninety-four percent of Americans approve of interracial marriage, including 93 percent of white Americans and 93 percent of Southerners (for context, when that question was first asked in 1958 the answer was 4 percent support across the board).\n\nWe're not saying race relations are perfect, and certainly, racism still exists in the United States. But many CRT advocates don't seem to realize that it's no longer 1960 and the vast majority of white Americans don't make decisions based on trying to maintain racial hierarchies. Parents oppose teaching CRT in schools, not because they're secretly hoping white supremacy becomes the law of the land again, but for a number of better reasons.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Here's Your Primer On Critical Race Theory, Now In A Town Near You\n\nCritical race theory, or CRT, has occupied an increasingly prominent place in public discourse since President Trump issued Executive Order 13950, \"Combating Race and Sex Stereotyping,\" which banned the federal government from using CRT in employee training.\n\nDuring the general election, then-candidate Joe Biden described CRT as nothing more than teaching people to be cognizant of others' feelings. One of President Biden's first acts was to revoke Executive Order 13950 and replace it with Executive Order 13985, \"Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government.\"\n\nBut what is CRT? Many people think critical race theory is part of the civil rights movement, but this is incorrect. Most Americans of a certain age believe that Martin Luther King Jr.'s hope that his children would be judged \"not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character\" is what society should strive toward, and is the practical definition of not being racist.\n\nCRT, and the many millions of millennials, Gen Z-ers, and current school children who have been steeped in its tenets, rejects colorblindness as both impossible and inequitable. The American Bar Association (ABA) explains that CRT is not a diversity and inclusion \"training,\" but a \"practice\" - not a noun, but a verb. The ABA continues:\n\nIt critiques how the social construction of race and institutionalized racism perpetuate a racial caste system that relegates people of color to the bottom tiers. CRT also recognizes that race intersects with other identities, including sexuality, gender identity, and others. CRT recognizes that racism is not a bygone relic of the past. Instead, it acknowledges that the legacy of slavery, segregation, and the imposition of second-class citizenship on Black Americans and other people of color continue to permeate the social fabric of this nation.\n\nThis official description of CRT from the ABA is worth paying attention to for a few reasons. First off, if CRT isn't merely training, but a practice, that means it isn't confined to one day or even one aspect of life. It's something you do over and over again so it becomes ingrained in your way of thinking and seeing the world.\n\nBecause it's \"evolving\" and \"malleable,\" you can never say \"these are the rules\" or \"we have a just social system.\" You can never rest, because this practice and evolution entail constantly searching for new aspects of injustice. Thus, people who ascribe to CRT are fond of phrases such as, \"We have not yet reached the mountaintop,\" \"The arc of history bends toward justice,\" and so on.\n\n\"A racial caste system that relegates people of color to the bottom tiers\" implies that race is used by all white people (and only white people) to oppress all people of color. It doesn't matter how many black CEOs, doctors, engineers, politicians, or celebrities there are. Nor does it matter that Asian students academically out-perform white students. Because whites are the single largest racial group in the country, under CRT they and anything that can be even remotely linked to white culture are considered oppressive to all non-white people.\n\nThe more \"victim\" categories a person falls into, the more oppressed he or she is by whites, particularly straight white men (even if the person never experiences disparate treatment ). If you are a disabled black lesbian, you are oppressed because of your multiple and intersecting identities, according to CRT and closely related intersectionality theory.\n\nFinally, the description of \"the legacy of slavery, segregation, and the imposition of second-class status on Black Americans and other people of color continue to permeate the social fabric of this nation,\" is referring to what we have come to know as \"systemic racism.\" Because the United States was primarily founded by and populated by whites, and because slavery and Jim Crow were due to whites, every system in the United States is tainted by racism to this day.\n\nOur economic system, school system, criminal justice system - all of them are fundamentally racist, concludes CRT. The proof offered in support of this proposition is that blacks and Hispanics have worse outcomes than whites, even when no proof of disparate treatment is offered. Nor is the fact that Asians do better across almost all these metrics than whites disprove that the systems are fundamentally racist.\n\n\"Whiteness\" and \"white privilege\" are also important concepts in CRT. They're linked to the concept of \"racial caste\" discussed above. The taxpayer-funded Smithsonian National Museum of African-American History asserts that \"whiteness\" is \"at the core of understanding race in America\" and \"the standard by which all other groups are compared.\" The Smithsonian continues:\n\nWhiteness and the normalization of white racial identity throughout America's history have created a culture where nonwhite persons are seen as inferior or abnormal. Whiteness (and its accepted normality) also exist as everyday microaggressions toward people of color. Acts of microaggressions include verbal, nonverbal, and environmental slights, snubs, or insults toward nonwhites. Whether intentional or not, these attitudes communicate hostile, derogatory, or harmful messages.\n\nSince white people in America hold most of the political, institutional, and economic power, they receive advantages that nonwhite groups do not. These benefits and advantages, or varying degrees, are known as white privilege . For many white people, this can be hard to hear, understand, or accept - but it is true. If you are white in America, you have benefited from the color of your skin.\n\nCRT's been gaining influence over the past several decades but has exploded since the George Floyd incident last summer. White supremacy is alleged to be everywhere. You may not have noticed it because it's so integral to American society. Therefore, if you're a white person, you must constantly examine yourself and your society for any vestiges of white supremacy. If you're a person of color, you must reflect on how white supremacy has affected you.\n\nTo give but one example, in August 2020 the University of Kentucky held trainings for student resident advisors (RAs). There was one training for \"Black, Indigenous, Person of Color,\" which was called the \"Healing Space for Staff of Color,\" while white RAs were expected to attend the \"White Accountability Space.\"\n\nRAs who were participating in the \"White Accountability Space\" were directed to review an attached document entitled \"Common racist behaviors and attitudes of white people\" prior to the session. The \"behaviors and attitudes\" in the document included:\n\nIn short, whites are \"damned if they do, and damned if they don't.\"\n\nThe University of Kentucky training wasn't an isolated incident. There were similar trainings for white male employees of the Sandia National Laboratory, for employees of Seattle city government, and for teachers in the Buffalo Public Schools, to name but a few. They're almost certainly taking place in your city government and public school system. They teach Americans to hate their country and each other.\n\nNo nation can long survive such inanity and divisiveness. The USSR's Nikita Krushchev, Leonid Brezhnev, and Yuri Andropov are spinning in their graves, unable to believe that after all their efforts to undermine and divide Americans, we're doing it much more successfully to ourselves.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Black history is American history-critical race theory is indoctrination\n\nWhen we look at the history of enslavement, why do we ask white kids and black kids to look at it differently?\n\nA recent curricular flip-flop at a Utah charter school shows plainly the problem with making the tenets of critical race theory the backbone of a history or social studies education: parents want out. As Maria Montessori Academy geared up to launch Black History Month, the school with a large majority of white students faced backlash from \"a few families,\" according to school director Micah Hirokawa. In response, he allowed them to \"opt out,\" before reversing course due to public disapproval of this plan , and made the course mandatory again.\n\nThe existence of critical race theory in education became more apparent this year, as parents were able to witness their kids' coursework as it streamed live into their homes through remote learning portals . As it turned out, what most parents would surely be on board with-the nuanced teaching of American history, faults and all-is not what the critical race theory model teaches.\n\nInstead, critical race theory, that shows all of history, literature, science, and even math through the lens of race and racism, squares oppressor against victim in a never ending grievance hierarchy that does little to teach black history, and everything to teach our kids that their racial differences are way more than skin deep. This is not going to result in a great education, in great lives for these kids, in an understanding of American history, or in the future of a great nation.\n\nThe cordoning off of \"black history\" from the rest of the history curriculum was a solution meant to fix the problem that the contributions of black Americans and the history of black Americans' suffering in the US was glossed over or even ignored by standard history teaching. That was a problem, a big problem, that needed to be remedied. The way this was done was by segmenting that history into one, short month, so that kids could try to grasp the information then and integrate it into the rest of their studies.\n\nThis proved to not be entirely effective, because these became separate lessons, learning about slavery, the Civil Rights Movement, and influential black leaders became a side-show to education, and not part of the main event. The idea that emerged after that pulled black history into the rest of the curriculum, but it still held it out as something different, there was still white history and black history. This, of course, is a bastardization of what history is and what the study of America for her school children needs to be.\n\nThe history of enslavement in America is not black history, it is American history. The legacy of slavery affects all of us, and any child, regardless of race, can have for her heroes Frederick Douglas, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, or so many other great Americans who contributed life and soul to the forming and ongoing betterment of the country.\n\nWhen we look at the history of enslavement, why do we ask white kids and black kids to look at it differently? Why do we tell white kids that they have benefitted from the legacy of slavery and racism and black kids that they are still victims to our nation's worst crime? Part of what critical race theory does is that it brings old grievances to bear on current events in a classroom setting.\n\nIn an effort to make kids understand how awful Jim Crowe laws were, it shows them how bad it would be, right here and now, for them to be implemented, and how, in many ways, the impact of those laws impacts their personal relationships with their peers in the room.\n\nBut that effort leads to division. Instead of framing the past through the lens of the races of students in the room, let kids understand not what their skin color would have meant historically with regard to whether or not they would have been oppressors or victims if they got into a time machine, but let them all understand that this is our, collective history, and that instead of being mired in that same muck, we are past it.\n\nEntrenching racism in the classroom will not lead to a nation free of racism. American slavery is not black history, it is American history, one in which we have a stake not as black or white people, but as Americans. The same is true for the Civil Rights Movement, or the history of the Revolutionary War, or the novels of John Steinbeck, James Baldwin, or Edith Wharton.\n\nThe parents in Utah who wanted to opt their kids out of Black History Month are probably like so many parents who want their kids to stop learning that skin color brings with it identifiable characteristics on which a person should be judged.\n\nBlack history is American history. Looking at history through the lens of race and racism, however, is divisive indoctrination. We can teach American history, the legacy of slavery, and the liberationist and oppressive forces that shaped our nation without teaching kids that their race is the most essential thing about them.\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

That conversation revealed that CRT advocates do not believe in America's founding documents, instead saying that \"the constitution should be burned.\"\n\nReusch spoke to Alfred \"shivy\" Brooks who is running for Atlanta City Council, Dr. Kate Slater who has worked in teacher recruitment for a top prep school, and Louiza \"Weeze\" Doran who were proponents of critical race theory. While undoubtedly these folks would define it differently, critical race theory is the practice of looking at all events both current and historical through the lens of race and racism.\n\nThe conversation turned to the principles of Enlightenment as the foursome tried to find common ground. Reusch asked if they could all agree that those principles represented the way forward. They could not.\n\n\"I just want to jump in and bring it back to the point,\" Doran said, turning to her computer to read off a definition of \"Enlightenment principles.\"\n\nDoran read that these principles were centered around the idea \"that reason is the primary source of authority and legitimacy and advocated such ideals as liberty, progress, tolerance, fraternity, constitutional government, and separations of church and state.\" But she's not into those things.\n\nWhat a critical race theorist really thinks: \"...our constitution should be burned, because our constitution in and of itself is only written for who owned land? Men at the time, it's still written accordingly. Who was owned? Black folks.\" pic.twitter.com/42AwHoSXKk\n\n\"Inherently, the problem with that, is that when our constitution was built, our constitution was built on those founding principles, but was not built on those founding principles including the humanization of marginalized folks.\n\n\"So you cannot cite our constitution, our constitution should be burned, because our constitution in and of itself is only written for who owned land? Men at the time, it's still written accordingly. Who was owned? Black folks. Those amendments have not been ratified. You should read your constitution.\"\n\nDoran said the constitution as it stands now is full of \"oppressive amendments and languaging.\" \"The constitution itself is only rooted in Enlightenment for white people, just like this country,\" said the educator.\n\nSlater answered Brooks' question \"How do you define whiteness?\"\n\n\"So yeah,\" Slater began. \"So whiteness I think that it-first of all, we know race is a construct-but whiteness was created to represent when you talk about whiteness as property, whiteness was created as a category to delineate people that could own property. People as property, that could enslave, that could oppress, that could use the weapons of settler colonialism, and they were allowed to be in that position because of a construct that was created about them.\"\n\nA critical race theorists' view of white people: \"Whiteness represents white guilt, white fragility, white supremacy, white violence. All of these things are now synonymous with whiteness, which I see as a stand-in for white supremacy.\" pic.twitter.com/t6Mh9JlA0T\n\n\"So by virtue of that, by virtue of that historical grounding... whiteness represents white guilt, white fragility, white supremacy, white violence. All of these things are now synonymous with whiteness, which I see as a stand-in for white supremacy,\" Slater continues.\n\n\"And by that, I simply mean: The ways in which this country preserves whiteness, as the default, and the norm, the ideal, in all of its spaces and all of its systems.\"\n\nBrooks then asks Reusch, after Slater's explanation, \"Do you view whiteness as property?\"\n\n\"I'm still just really confused by whiteness,\" Reusch says.\n\nSlater tries to help him understand by explaining that \"In this country whiteness has currency, right? Whiteness has always had currency. Whiteness has always had value. Monetarily, power, systematic, value, sewn up in us being white people. There is power in inherent with that, just like there is experiences of disadvantages and oppression that are sewn up in the experiences of people of color in this country because of whiteness. These two things are in opposition to each other, right?\"\n\n\"Whiteness is not phenotypic whiteness,\" Doran tells a visibly confused Reusch. \"There's white people and there's people who happen to be white, for sure, right? Whiteness is a... set of ideologies, ideas, institutions, and policies that have been explicitly set up, rooted, and born in white supremacy, predicated on the binary of white and black, good and bad, and all of the tropes that come with it in order to maintain oppression.\"\n\nFor a critical race theorists there's a difference between \"white people\" and \"people who happen to be white.\" pic.twitter.com/X7azJLT8BI\n\nDoran continues, \"The reason I say white folks and people who happen to be white is because anyone that is born in the world, because whiteness is global, can absolutely abide by tenets of whiteness. This is why we have Candace Owens,\" Doran says, listing off other black people she disagrees with.\n\n\"This is why we have black folks who will say critical race theory is trash, because there is trauma rooted in that for marginalized folks, that means they try to increase their proximity to those ideals and those policies and those institutions for safeness.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, people who are phenotypically white have a choice. They can-because we're all indoctrinated into whitenesS-they can choose to uphold the system that was built for and by them on our backs, those are white people.\n\n\"Then there's people who happen to be white,\" she says, identifying these as people who are \"committed to dismantling that same system, using her identity privilege. Does that full breakdown make it a little bit clearer?\"\n\n\"Yes, it does,\" Reusch concedes. \"Yes, it's a theory. Okay. Yes.\"\n\nBrooks laughs, and Reusch's concession is not enough for Doran, who replies \"It's not a theory. Like a theory means we can sit here and-like critical race theory for example that's a theory. Because there are tons of ways to go at dismantling systems of oppression.\" Doran says that she doesn't even agree with all the tenets of CRT.\n\n\"But, there are certain facts in our social fabric,\" Doran says, listing off some of these \"facts.\"\n\n\"Whiteness is a construct that was 1000 percent created under Prince Philip's guidance at the birth of the enslavement of black Africans and the human trafficking of black Africans for the purpose of increasing wealth for Portugal, because they could no longer tax their people. That was very intentionally fabricated, through pseudoscience, through religious-religion, and through history, right?\n\n\"So we cannot say it's a theory when we have so much empirical and historical evidence to tell us that these things are in fact real and true,\" Doran said.\n\nIf critical race theorists are unwilling to use the constitutional foundations of American democracy as a starting point for any change or adjustment that they feel needs be made, then it is hard to believe that anything that have to say about how progress should be made can be even remotely valid.\n\nThose who want to burn the nation to the ground and rebuild something as-yet unimagined from our country's ashes do not have the good of the nation or her people at heart.\n\nReusch commented on the shared, two hour long conversation when he posted it.\n\nHe wrote that: \"While one could say that very little was accomplished, or that this wasn't productive, this is a rare and very clear example of what CRT looks like in practice- conversation, the classroom, etc.\n\n\"K-12 needs to be a place where curiosity is encouraged & supported and that includes issues over clarity of language, specific complexities & nuance, personal experiences, etc.\"\n\nCritical race theory has come under fire by parents and educators who actively believe in equality, justice, due process, opposing racism, and the constitution.\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.

      "text": "Teachers don't want parents to know they're indoctrinating their kids\n\nThis simplified cuisine of critical race theory that's being spoon-fed to kids strips them of the concept that they can determine their own future. Instead they are taught a kind of racial determinism.\n\nA teacher made a startling revelation as to what he believes about the problem of parents in education. Matt R. Kay , an author and founding teacher at Philadelphia's Science Leadership Academy, worries about the impact of remote learning on students. But for Ray, the problem isn't the lack of socialization or hands-on learning, it's that parents will be privy to classroom conversations about critical race and gender theory that should otherwise be private.\n\nKay wrote that he's concerned that \"virtual class discussions will have many spectators,\" including parents, and that teacher will \"never quite be sure who is overhearing the discourse.\" He asks \"What does this do for our equity/inclusion work?\"\n\nMany educators retweeted, commented and liked the post. Many parents and concerned citizens view this thread as evidence of the need to pull kids from leftist educational indoctrination factories and embark fully upon homeschool. Kay remarks that kids depend on the privacy of the classroom, and that educators do, too, in order to teach ideas that many parents would find unpalatable.\n\nKay notes, specifically, that he is worried that conservative parents will come between teachers and students, that these parents will see the kind of nonsense that is being distributed and will take issue with it. He states that his concern is for the students, but it's more likely that, while his intentions are student-based, his real concern is that these kinds of ideas will no longer get a hearing solely by the naïve ears of students, but by educated, critical thinkers who know the difference between history, for example, and critical theory.\n\nKay's thread, which is now locked behind a protected Twitter account, gives clarity to those of us that have been concerned about the level of leftist ideology that is being peddled under the guise of education. And the fact that so many other educators like and retweeted it offers an inkling of an insight into where educational principles lie today. Kay's tweet brought more than one indoctrinaire teacher out of the wood-work.\n\nEducators in many schools want nothing more than to get students to look at history, culture, and contemporary society through the lens of race and racism. The problem with the emphasis on race and racism is that, like the phenomenon of first learning a new word and then seeing it everywhere, focusing on race and racism as the primary drivers in society and the only way in which culture is viewed means that we see it in everything, whether it's actually there or not.\n\nThe problem with the emphasis on race and racism is that it is not having the effect of lessening racism or racial tension. The effect is in fact the opposite. The question, however, is if racism is actually increasing, or it is merely perceived to be increasing because we're not even looking for anything else.\n\nA recent analysis of the terms racist(s) and racism as printed in a few of America's most widely read and influential daily papers, as reported by Zach Goldberg in Tablet Magazine , shows that during the same period when this kind of emphasis was increasing, so too were the perceptions of Americans that racism was on the rise, as were these words more prevalent in mainstream media usage.\n\nIs it that the racism was increasing? Or merely that this was all we were guiding ourselves to see? Could it really be true that at a time when more black women are running for office , achieving positions of power in government, and when our country had its first black president, our culture was ramping up racism? Or is it more likely that we have been looking for it?\n\nAs the definition of racism morphed from that which is directly enshrined in law or outright direct hate to things like microaggressions and implicit unconscious biases, racism has emerged from every crevice of culture. Is it really there or are we looking for it so hard that we manifest it? As we increase racial bias awareness training, enhance children's ability to spot racial bias in society at large, and teach them to define and recognize their own privilege, we are disenfranchising kids their own agency and freewill.\n\nWhat does it mean to teach kids to see their own efforts as irrelevant in their success? Kids are learning to recognize that their skin colour has more relevance to their success or failure than their own hard work or perseverance. They are learning that society is too racist for black children too succeed, and so racist that white kids who do succeed do so on the basis of being a member of a privileged race.\n\nInstead of racism decreasing, the enhanced focus on inequity leads to greater classifications of things that we did not previously believe to be inequitable as exactly that.\n\nThose who are now educating youth were the guinea pigs in the social justice classroom labs of the 1990's when these ideas began to get rolled out. They went on to college to study more critical theory, and emerged armed with enough jargon to pass these ideas on to the next generation of students, starting at younger and younger ages.\n\nThis simplified cuisine of critical race theory that's being spoon-fed to kids strips them of the concept that they can determine their own future. Instead they are taught a kind of racial determinism. Recognizing and learning about America's racist past is one thing, and it's important, but entrenching it as a permanent legacy that will live on into the future is a disingenuous and destructive lie.\n\nIbram X. Kendi, who has been touted alongside Robin DiAngelo as a great anti-racist author, penned a piece in The Atlantic where he discovered exactly the same thing that Goldberg discovered in Tablet Magazine , but he interpreted it radically differently. He notes that the perception among Americans is that discrimination has been increasing, from about 2012 on into 2018. He blames the Tea Party movement, and Trump for these increases.\n\nThere is no doubt that racism exists, but the lesson being taught to school children by educators who fear that parents will see what they've been up to is that racism is the driving force in the American story. This lesson has not eradicated or reduced racism, but increased it.\n\nWe've heard from activists and even the Smithsonian that ideals of individuality and merit based advancement and success are racist. But if we don't believe in these things, what reason would any kid have to work hard and to excel? Why would any kid seek to live up to their full potential if they believe that race will be a hinderance to either that success or to them gaining that success on their own merit?\n\nIf we allow ourselves to become a nation of racial determinists, where hard work is removed entirely from the reasons behind success, and we envision racist bogey-men in every corner, we will not get far, and our kids will be the ones who pay the price for our ignorance and misguidance.\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.
