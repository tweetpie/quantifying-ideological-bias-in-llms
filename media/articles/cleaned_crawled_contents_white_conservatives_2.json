      "text": "White conservatives envy African-Americans' deep patriotism, lash out at their history\n\nYou may know about the Times' 1619 Project , a major endeavor published last weekend to reframe the citizenry's understanding of the role of slavery in the founding of America. You may also know about the white conservative reaction to the project. Perhaps the most fascinating take came from the Cato Institute's Ilya Shapiro :\n\nI'm not going to defend the Times , because I think the scholarship, commentary and reporting speak for themselves. (I will single out for praise, though, Kurt Streeter's piece about the NBA's very slow evolution into a black business enterprise.) I'm not going to critique the white conservative reaction either. That, too, speaks for itself .\n\nI do want to point out what these white conservatives (all men, of course) who are expressing anger with the 1619 Project are saying: they love their country. But their love seems provisional to me, like it depends on clear terms and conditions that if unmet will trigger some kind of escape clause. Love, when real, doesn't work that way.\n\nMoreover, they seem unwilling to recognize the deep abiding patriotism of black Americans. Love, when real, is unconditional. It can endure anything . But these men can't endure even the truth . Maybe they're less upset about the 1619 Project than they are about the probability that black Americans love America better than they do.\n\nTake Shapiro's claim that the Times , in speaking the truth about slavery, and in saying that the African-American experience is central to comprehending America, is an effort to \"delegitimize\" the US. That's so interesting. I mean, it's false. In no way does a country's history delegitimize it. That's just silly, and Shapiro should know better.\n\nI also mean that nothing in the 1619 Project says America is not \"mankind's grandest, experiment in human liberty & self-governance.\" It does say that that was true in the beginning only for property-owning (rich) white Protestant men. It does say that the country was built on the perverse paradox of human equality and liberty as well as human bondage. It does say that slavery, as well as the racism that justified it, have continued to shape our ways of thinking. Only with time has America come closer to \"mankind's grandest, experiment in human liberty & self-governance.\"\n\nThe fact that America is an ongoing experiment , not a state of being perfected at the beginning, is lost on some conservatives. And because it's lost, they can't and won't tolerate the truth. Because they can't and won't tolerate the truth, they search for other motives for truth-telling, malevolent motives that are cynically political, having nothing to do with the altruism of correcting an error in our understanding of our history.\n\nThat wouldn't be so bad if it weren't so sad.\n\nAgain, these white conservative men profess love for America, but when pressed, it's clear they don't love their country. Not as it was. Not as it is. Not as it may be in the future. And not when the truth does not satisfy clear terms and conditions. They love something else, something unreal. And that's what's really being delegitimized-an infatuation with a myth, a fable, a tall-tale that makes them feel oh-so -good.\n\nAnd even that wouldn't be so bad if clinging to the myth of America, rather than the fact of it, did not also deny the deep abiding love felt by the people who fought so hard and died so much to be thought of as real Americans. As Adam Serwer said , in a different context, a peculiar irony of our history is that \"the American creed has no more devoted adherents than those who have been historically denied its promises, and no more fair-weather friends than those who have taken them for granted.\"\n\nI'm not suggesting Shapiro and others are taking the American creed for granted. But I am suggesting their patriotism is built on sand. And perhaps they well know it. Indeed, it would be hard not to when compared to black Americans treated so badly and for so long in this country, and who still love America, and make it better."

      "text": "10 Things Everyone Should Know About White Supremacy\n\nThe use of the phrase \"white supremacy\" is ubiquitous in American political discourse. This is a result of many factors. Primarily, the election of Barack Obama and the United States' changing racial demographics have created a reactionary backlash from white conservatives.\n\nWhite supremacy is referenced in relation to specific news events as well. For example, the murder rampage by the neo-Nazi Frazier Glenn Miller, the recent weeks-long debate between pundits Ta-Nehisi Coates and Jonathan Chait about \"black pathology\"; birtherism; stand-your-ground laws; and the open embrace of the symbols and rhetoric of the old slave-holding Confederacy by the Republican Party have been framed and discussed in terms of white supremacy.\n\nConservatives and progressive often use the phrase \"white supremacy\" in divergent ways. Conservatives use the phrase in the service of a dishonest \"colorblind\" agenda, evoking extreme images of KKK members and Nazis as the exclusive and only examples of white racism in American life and politics. Conservatives use extreme caricatures of white supremacy in order to deflect and protect themselves from charges that the contemporary Republican Party is a white identity organization fueled by white racial resentment.\n\nLiberals, progressives and anti-racists use the phrase \"white supremacy\" to describe the overt and subtle racist practices of movement conservatism in the post-Civil Rights era, and how American society is still structured around maintaining and protecting white privilege.\n\nThis analysis is largely correct: however, it often conflates concepts such as racism, white privilege, and white supremacy with one another. Language does political work.\n\nIn the age of Obama, the phrase \"white supremacy\" is often used in political discussions like an imprecise shotgun blast or a blockbuster bomb. If the Common Good and American democracy are to be protected-countering how the right wing has used the politics of white racial resentment, racial manipulation, and hate to mobilize its voters in support of a plutocratic agenda-a more precise weapon is needed. A necessary first step in that direction requires the development of a more detailed and transparent exploration of the concept known as \"white supremacy.\"\n\nWhat is white supremacy?\n\n1. White supremacy is a complex social phenomenon. It is also a relatively new invention that was created to make Europe's efforts to colonize and conquer the world seem like a \"natural\" process wherein \"superior\" white races would dominate \"inferior\" non-whites.\n\nThe Transatlantic slave trade was pivotal for the invention of race by creating a sense of group stigma and a belief in the concrete biological differences between white Europeans and Africans.\n\nIn the United States, a white supremacist racial order was birthed by a revolt in 17th-century Virginia, when black and white indentured servants allied together to fight for their freedom and rights. White elites defeated their rebellion and instituted a system of racial classification in which white indentured servants would be given land and guns after their service was complete while blacks would be made into a permanent class of slaves.\n\n2. White supremacy is comprised of habits, actions and beliefs. It is not necessarily reliant on the specific intentions of its actors, practitioners or beneficiaries. Of course, there are \"active\" racists whose intentions, words, and deeds are meant to advance a racist agenda. However, implicit and subconscious bias, as well as taken for granted stereotypes and \"common sense,\" can also serve a white supremacist order. Ultimately, intent is secondary to the unequal outcomes across the colorline that individuals benefit from and perpetuate.\n\nWhite supremacy also has the power to reorient and reimagine empirical reality for those who have consciously and/or subconsciously internalized and learned its principals and assumptions. White privilege is central here: those people considered \"white\" are also judged to be \"normal\"; the experiences of white people are taken to be universal and a baseline for how others are to be evaluated; African-Americans are judged en masse as having \"bad culture\" while whites are de facto viewed as having \"good culture.\"\n\nWhite people are viewed as individuals where the bad behavior of one white person does not reflect at all on the merits of the group. By comparison, African Americans and other people of color are not afforded that freedom. Ultimately, for white supremacy one's \"Americanness\" is naturally linked to one's whiteness, while the loyalty, and sense of civic belonging assigned to people of color, is contingent until proven otherwise.\n\n3. Images of terrorist organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis serve as outlier caricatures of racism in the post-Civil Rights era. These cartoon versions of white racism do the work of white supremacy as a social and political force because they present virulent white racism as an anachronism or the habit of somehow damaged and defective white people who should be ejected from the public square. In colorblind America, \"polite\" and \"respectable\" white supremacy is far more dangerous to the life chances and safety of people of color than the overt racism of the Ku Klux Klan or other racially chauvinistic organizations.\n\n4. In the most basic sense, white supremacy is a philosophical, material, ethical, economic, scientific, religious, and political system that works to maintain the dominant and relative superior group position of those identified as \"white\" (and their allies) over those marked as \"non-white.\"\n\nThus, white supremacy is the philosophical and systemic umbrella for white racism.\n\n5. Racism and prejudice are not the same things. Racism is prejudice plus power. Racism is also the ability of one group of people to systematically impact the life chances and freedom of others who are deemed to be the Other.\n\nAlthough it is convenient and easy to believe that all groups in the United States are equally \"racist,\" such a claim is empirically unfounded. Moreover, such a fiction sustains white supremacy by ignoring the vast amounts of historical and contemporary evidence detailing how American society is politically, economically, and socially structured to the advantage of white people.\n\nIn the United States, white people are the dominant racial group. Of course, there are white individuals who commit active and intentionally racist acts. But, the most powerful manifestation of white supremacy as a type of group power is how individual white people in American society can still passively benefit from white racism and the psychological, material and political advantages it brings to their group.\n\nThe racial logic and commonsense of white supremacy (and a white racist society) is sustained by not asking about first principles. For example, what public policy decisions led to white Americans having at least 20 times the wealth of black Americans ? Why are urban black and brown communities economically disadvantaged, and white communities (i.e. the suburbs), have been materially advantaged by comparison? Whose interests are served by a criminal justice system that disproportionately and unfairly punishes people of color? 9. Colorblind racism is the most recent iteration in a white supremacist order where it is possible to have \"racism without racists,\" and a black American president, while social and institutional systems still privilege whites over African Americans and other people of color. White racial innocence, and a sincere belief by many white folks that they do not hold racist attitudes, or benefit personally or collectively from systemic white racism, is an example of how white supremacy has evolved to make itself relatively invisible (to willfully ignorant white people) as a dominant social force in American life. Consequently, one of the deep tensions and challenges surrounding racial discourse in post-Civil Rights America is how to locate a given white person's relationship to a broader system of institutional racism.\n\n10. Austerity, neoliberalism, globalization, and the culture of cruelty are some of the most powerful social forces in post-Civil Rights America. White supremacy does not exist separate or apart from those ideologies and practices.\n\nThe destruction of the social safety net and the siphoning of resources from the middle and working classes to the very rich is legitimized through a language which focuses on punishing the \"lazy\" and \"unproductive\" poor, i.e. people of color, in the service of \"efficiency\" and \"fairness.\"\n\nThe gutting of the public sector, deindustrialization and the wholesale elimination of jobs which pay a living wage, has had a disproportionate impact on black and brown communities. In many ways, the onerous assault on the (white) American middle class by the forces of Austerity and \"privatization\" was tested and pioneered on inner-city, working-class, black and brown communities.\n\nThe militarization of police departments, the excessive use of police force against innocent people, and the surveillance society was first applied to black and brown communities in America's central cities. These policies met with little complaint from white people who felt that they were being \"protected\" from \"black crime.\" Those forces are now being unleashed on the white middle-class to their surprise and shock.\n\nWhite supremacy involves, both in the present and historically, the systematic transfer of wealth, income, and other resources from non-whites to whites as a general group, and a white elite, in particular. There are many examples of this phenomenon.\n\nWhite Americans have at least 20 times the wealth of blacks and Latinos. The Homestead Act, the New Deal and the GI Bill, were all examples of wealth creation opportunities and an inter-generational transfer of resources within the white community that African Americans and other people of color were specifically denied access to. The extreme levels of wealth and income inequality in the United States is a story of how race and class work together to structure life outcomes."

      "website": "https://www.alternet.org",
      "text": "Disturbing research helps explain white conservatives' obsession with guns\n\nToo many Americans love guns more than they do other human beings.\n\nThere have been at least 50 mass shootings in America since the massacre and apparent hate crime attack against Asian Americans in the Atlanta area on March 16.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has done nothing to stop America's addiction to gun violence. Writing at the Nation, Tom Engelhardt explains , \"In the first 73 days of Joe Biden's presidency, there were five mass shootings and more than 10,000 gun-violence deaths. In the Covid-19 era, this has been the model the world's 'most exceptional' nation (as American politicians of both parties used to love to call this country) has set for the rest of the planet. Put another way, so far in 2020 and 2021, there have been two pandemics in America, Covid-19 and guns.\"\n\nToo many Americans love guns even more than money. It is estimated that gun violence costs the United States at least $150 billion a year.\n\nIn response to discussions about an assault weapons ban after the mass shootings in Atlanta and Boulder, Sen. Lindsey Graham told Fox News' Chris Wallace , \"If there's a natural disaster in South Carolina where the cops can't protect my neighborhood, my house will be the last ones that the gangs will come to, because I can defend myself.\"\n\nThe next day, Graham circulated a video of himself shooting an AR-15 assault rifle at a South Carolina gun range.\n\nFor many progressives, liberals and other Americans who are not part of the MAGAverse, TrumpWorld or America's gun culture, Graham's performance of gun-toting hyper masculinity was laughable. His comments about defending his family from \"gangs\" were also criticized as being especially ill-timed given the recent mass shooting events . But again, as is so many other instances, those outside of the right-wing echo chamber were not the audience for Graham's performance.\n\nThe South Carolina senator was speaking to a right-wing culture, moral universe and imaginary where guns, whiteness and toxic masculinity are tightly if not immutably linked together. He was channeling the idea of the white American male as defender of his home and family - and of heterosexual white (right-wing) male power and privilege - against some type of \"criminal\" or \"invader,\" generally understood to be black or brown. This enemy to be defended against may be a \"Muslim terrorist,\" an \"urban\" black male or a \"Latino gangbanger.\" He may also be a member of \"antifa,\" the right wing's current bogeyman.\n\nLindsey Graham's assault rifle and others like it are also central to end-times survivalist dystopian fantasies of societal breakdown and failed government that involve \"race war,\" environmental collapse, another pandemic or other such disaster.\n\nIn years gone by, the enemy was the \"Indian\" attacking white settlers in the Old West. Of course, America's imperial Manifest Destiny project viewed white-settler colonialism as a noble \"civilizing\" project, in which the gun was an indispensable tool for killing the Other and maintaining control over black human property and other \"subject races.\"\n\nEvoking the mythos of the Revolutionary War, the MAGAverse and TrumpWorld (and ammosexuals and gun fetishists more generally) also consider Lindsey Graham's AR-15 as his \"musket\" or \"freedom rifle.\"\n\nAs signified in an oft-discussed advertisement for a Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle, such weapons supposedly offer their owners a chance to get their \"Man Card,\" which evidently confer godlike power over life and death, and with it enhanced libidinal drives and allure. The totemic power of such assault-style weapons also enhances their \"rights\" as (white) men and by implication control over \"their\" women and families, and society at large.\n\nNew research from University of Illinois-Chicago political scientists Alexandra Filindra, Beyza Buyuker and Noah J. Kaplan offers insights into these connections between gun ownership, white masculinity, racism and patriotism.\n\nIn an essay for the Washington Post, they elaborate:\n\nThese scholars' new research points to further conclusions:\n\nThese findings complement other research showing the connection between gun ownership and death anxiety where the gun is understood, on a subconscious level, to confer some form of immortality. Filindra, Buyuker and Kaplan's findings also support other research showing the connections between gun ownership, support for \"stand your ground\" and concealed-carry laws and racial hostility towards black people.\n\nA majority of Americans - including many gun owners and even NRA members - support commonsense gun laws such as mandatory waiting periods for buying handguns, limiting access to certain types of weapons and ammunition, improving background checks and closing the \"gun show loophole.\" President Biden has repeatedly expressed his support for such initiatives.\n\nUnfortunately, these rational and reasonable approaches to gun violence as a public health problem will do little if anything to heal or fix the way many Americans - especially white men - understand guns as a key part of their core identity and fundamental personhood. As Jonathan Metzl shows in his book \"Dying of Whiteness\" , many white men in America are literally willing to die (and kill) for their guns.\n\nAmerica's gun violence crisis is a public policy problem. But resolving that problem involves overcoming the way that powerful, moneyed interests such as the gun industry and the NRA can manipulate the spiritual emptiness and emotional insecurities felt by many gun owners.\n\nUltimately, America is sick with gun fever, and will remain so, because too many Americans want it that way."

      "text": "Dear Angry White Conservatives Mourning Romney's Loss: Chill Out\n\nDear angry white conservatives who are mourning Mitt Romney's loss,\n\nIf Fox News is any indication, many of you are dismayed, upset, and befuddled by Mitt Romney's loss to President Obama. Some of these feelings are normal. Politics is tribal. When your team loses, a bit of sadness is expected.\n\nHowever, some white folks are acting out in some very unhealthy ways. Young white conservatives participated in a near riot at the University of Mississippi, where they hurled rocks at bystanders, used racial slurs, and burned Obama and Biden campaign signs. Other angry white folks used the Internet to send out racist messages and pictures on Twitter as an act of protest and anger at the country's re-election of its first Black president. I believe that these events are malicious outliers.\n\nMany white people who voted for Mitt Romney are simply scared and angry that a \"Black socialist Muslim atheist Communist usurper\" was re-elected President of the United States.\n\nEighty-nine percent of Mitt Romney's voters were white. Fifty-nine percent of the white vote went to Mitt Romney. He also won the majority of white voters in every age and gender group . We live in a country that is racially segregated. The United States is also very polarized politically. At present, Americans are not talking to each other across the dividing lines of race, class, and ideology.\n\nBecause many white conservatives only interact with like-minded people who come from the same racial background, it seemed obvious to them that Obama was going to be defeated on election night. With the defeat of Mitt Romney, they are experiencing the universal hurt that comes when reality interjects itself into a dream world and fantasy.\n\nMany white people are feeling imperiled because President Obama's win is being framed by the news media as a sign that people of color are gaining political power in the United States. The pundits keep talking about \"the browning of America\" and how the Republican Party will continue to lose elections if it just relies on white voters to win. I imagine that many white people, especially conservatives and older voters, may be feeling a bit obsolete as the country changes around them.\n\nBut I will tell you things that other people will not; I will tell you the truth even when it makes you upset.\n\nThe media wants to scare you with all sorts of talk about how, in a few decades, America will be a \"majority minority\" country. You \"want your country back,\" and people mock you for these sentiments. I am a good listener. Other people find joy in your tears and from the sad images of Mitt Romney's headquarters, Republican rallies, and voters on election night. I feel your pain.\n\nGuess what? Things are going to be okay.\n\nFirst, we need to admit that many white conservatives have a problem. They are victims. I know that you do not want to hear that word. \"Victims\" is a word that only the liberals, progressives, Black people, gays, and feminists use.\n\nPlease hear me out. We know that most conservatives get their news and information exclusively from Fox News and other types of right-wing media. I get the appeal of this habit: it feels really good to be told that your point of view is correct, and that most of the country agrees with you, even when it does not.\n\nYou are very trusting people by nature. As conservatives, you are also very deferential to authority. Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, and the right-wing media have been saying that good white folks like you are being discriminated against by Barack Obama and his legions of black and brown people. There are supposedly groups of Black radicals who stand around outside polling places, looking all mean and angry, and a Black attorney general who hates white people. According to sites like the Drudge Report, there are roving gangs of Black people who live to waylay and beat up white people. Hispanic immigrants are sneaking into the country by the millions and taking your jobs.\n\nA good many of you white people think things are so bad in the Age of Obama that you actually believe that anti-white \"racism\" is a huge problem facing the country. White men are supposedly the saddest and most oppressed of all groups , as recent research has revealed that many of them have lost all hope in the country's future.\n\nThe right-wing media failed you. They lied and told you that Mitt Romney would win in a landslide. They cooked up stories about voter fraud and rigged polls that were biased against Republicans. The right-wing media machine betrayed you, its audience.\n\nIf I were a white conservative who listened to the right-wing media, I would be scared and upset too. I would feel confused. How could so many people lie to me? It just isn't fair! It must be some type of conspiracy.\n\nI do not have a ready answer. But I do want to help you feel better. I am going to let you in on a secret that Fox News and the Republican party will not share with you.\n\nWhite people run America. More specifically, white men are the most powerful group of people in the United States. Yes, people who look just like you remain in charge. White men control every major social, political, economic, and cultural institution in the United States. With few exceptions, white men are the CEOs of every Fortune 500 company.\n\nWhite men control both Hollywood and the mass media. There, approximately 95 percent of the most important positions as writers, directors, advertising, producers, show runners, executives, and the like are held by white men.\n\nThis is a great advantage in a country where white men make up 30 percent of the U.S. population.\n\nWhite men control the United States Congress and Senate. There are now 20 women in the Senate-a record number. But there are no African Americans in the same governing body. There are two Hispanic and Asian senators, respectively. The majority of senior-level and cabinet positions in the federal government are held by white men. White men are also over-represented on the United States Supreme Court.\n\nYes, it is true that the President of the United States happens to be a Black man; this is a groundbreaking achievement that should not be easily discounted or dismissed. However, Barack Obama has faced unparalleled levels of opposition and resistance from conservatives in Congress-and from many white people in the country as a whole-because of his racial background. While many white folks may not know this, the country's first Black president has done remarkably little in terms of advancing policy goals that would directly benefit people of color in the United States. In fact, Obama has spoken less about race than any president in 50 years.\n\nUltimately, Barack Obama is a Black man who is the chief executive of a white government .\n\nWhite folks have a tendency to see racial progress as a zero sum game : if they feel that they are \"losing\" then someone else must be \"winning.\" In the time of the Great Recession and its aftermath, these anxieties are especially acute. But guess what my friends? Even in the worst economic downturn in 80 years, whites are doing much better than people of color.\n\nThe Black middle class has been decimated by the recession. While almost all Americans saw their economic fortunes decline in this moment, people of color were most acutely impacted. Even in this economic environment, white people have at least 22 times the wealth of Blacks and Latinos (this gap doubled during the recession).\n\nIn addition, white women in their peak earning years are worth an average of 40 thousand dollars. By comparison, Black women and Latinas have a net wealth of about 5 dollars. As sociologist Joe Feagin documents, of the 400 richest Americans according to Forbes magazine, 86 percent of them are white men.\n\nWhile many white men have been bombarded by the media with stories about how they are disadvantaged in the job market by \"quotas\" and \"reverse discrimination,\" the new book Documenting Desegregation exposes such beliefs to be a myth. Since 1966, white men have actually increased their numbers in senior management positions and gained an even greater hold over middle management positions in corporate America.\n\nIn this poor economy many white people are hurting financially; nevertheless, they are doing much better than people of color.\n\nBecause I spend a good amount of time talking to white people, I can anticipate the obvious question. Many of you are likely still thinking about this numbers game, and how white folks are going to be a \"minority\" in America. Do not worry. White people are still going to be the largest single racial group in this country; you simply may not be the majority of the population.\n\nI have a second secret for you. White folks possess one of the most valuable gifts in the history of the United States.\n\nYou are considered \"white.\"\n\n\"Whiteness\" is an amazing invention that has only been around a few centuries. In the United States, it has been something to die for, protect, and kill for. Historically, whiteness is a type of very lucrative property that is handed down through families, and has been protected by the law.\n\nAs the comedian Louis CK smartly observed , being white in America is one hell of a great deal. If offered the choice, he would sign up every year because of all the unearned privileges and advantages that come with it. Whiteness is such a great deal because white folks do not have to actively do anything to benefit from it. However, white people are amazingly protective of this prize-and really careful about whom they let in the club.\n\nFor example, the Irish, Italians, Jews, Poles, and other \"white ethnics\" were once viewed as a type of European \"other\" at the turn of the 20th century. If history is a guide, racial groups that are now considered non-white will become the new \"white\" people in the years to come. Whiteness always finds a way to keep on winning and to grow its numbers.\n\nMy white conservative friends, these feel like scary times for you. As the country changes, the Republican party is going to have to do some soul searching. You will likely be asked to engage in some difficult conversations about the relationship between your political values and racism. As the Southern Poverty Law Center has documented, white folks are going to be under pressure to surrender to their worse and lesser natures by hate groups, dead enders like the Tea Party, and militia groups who will play on your anxieties about the demographic shifts we are seeing in the United States. If you are smart, patient, and pragmatic, there are voices out there-white conservatives in fact-who are trying to help your movement adapt to the 21st century. Do seek them out. You can get your own house in order, and not live in a state of irrational fear and sadness.\n\nRacism and conservatism do not have to be the same thing in America. Mitt Romney's defeat should be a wake up call in this regard.\n\nThings are going to be okay. As someone who cares about my white brothers and sisters, I want you all to feel safe, secure, and prosperous. You will see that a changing America, one in which all people have a shot at success across the color line, is to our nation's collective advantage. A good number of white folks already understand this fact. As such, they chose to vote for President Obama-the candidate who clearly demonstrated that he was best prepared to lead the country forward.  I hope you can come along as we all work together in the service of the Common Good."

      "text": "What Trump's hardcore 'working class white' supporters miss when they talk about secession\n\nPresident Donald Trump's proposed border wall, and the continuing shutdown of the federal government over it, is only the most recent symbol of the increasing schism in American public life. Despite extensive debate, there is no easy solution to reconcile the so-called red America-blue America divide.\n\nCertainly, facts don't seem to matter to Trump's supporters. The wall won't stop immigration, an outstanding analysis by the Cato Institute's David Bier shows. Nor will it affect distribution of the deadliest drugs (by far) identified by the Drug Enforcement Administration , opioid pharmaceuticals. (We might as well shut down all travel to the U.S. from the U.K. and Ireland, and build separate walls around Connecticut and New Jersey, to cut off the largest pill suppliers.)\n\nTrump's wall is simply a $35 billion symbol: America's reverse Statue of Liberty, a beacon of racist hostility illuminating his supporters' goal of reversing demographic change . It deserves uncompromising opposition.\n\nAs Trump's hardcore Republican base of some 50 million to 60 million voting adults becomes more extreme and intransigent and the larger, anti-Trump resistance grows, will some sort of national partitioning be the only way to avoid violent repressions and confrontations? The word secession pops up in heated political moments, but it hasn't gained much traction since the Civil War until recently. For example, one-third of voters in Texas and California are open to secession-for opposite reasons.\n\nConsider a negotiated compromise along the lines of Switzerland's autonomous cantons. America's urban and liberal areas would be allowed expansive powers to retain most revenues and govern themselves as the \"Blue State,\" protecting immigrants, civil rights, environmental regulations, and public services. In exchange, Trump supporters could establish their own largely self-governing, fiscally independent \"Red State,\" uniting strongly conservative, mostly White areas under the rubric of restricting immigration and codifying right-wing policies.\n\nAssume further the new Blue State and Red State would roughly reflect the demographics of their respective voters and urban/rural bases. About half of Blue's adults would be Whites age 30 and older; the other half would include younger Whites and a significant non-White population. In contrast, 80 percent of Red's adults would be over-30 Whites.\n\nThis is where a massive, structural problem intrudes-one that might point to a path away from national breakup and toward practical reconciliation.\n\nThat's because the Red State would quickly fail. The reason is a natural limit demographers call the \" dependency ratio .\"\n\nThe age distribution of Trump's backers indicate their rural/small-town Red State would have fewer than three working-age people (defined here as ages 20 through 64) to support each of their state's numerous residents age 65 and older. That is far fewer than the four or more workers per senior a Western society needs to generate the necessary production and revenues to fund Social Security, Medicare, and basic public infrastructure and supply goods and services. The aging population also could not appreciably raise White birth rates on its own.\n\nCrises would mount. The loss of revenue generated by Red State's small workforce would yield increasingly severe deficits. Heavy taxation of workers and loss of services to elders would diminish quality of life and drive out younger people. Even with outside subsidies (which would undermine the state's independence), such a state would have to import millions of younger \"guest workers,\" overwhelmingly non-White, to survive (which would reignite White anxiety).\n\nThe troubles of the Red State would stand in contrast to the robust economic prospects of the mostly urban Blue State, now rid of tens of millions of dependent elders. Blue would have a balanced ratio of four to five workers per senior. With a generally better-educated workforce , better public services, and access to global markets, it would generate more than enough production and revenues to fund senior needs and social investments.\n\nThe projected dysfunction of a hypothetical Red America mirrors the current divide in well-being splitting rural and urban America. The aging White, largely rural, and Trump-voting counties suffer unfavorable dependency ratios averaging 2.6 workers per senior, leading to downward spirals of reduced local revenues, school and hospital closures, public-sector decay, and social disruption. Centers for Disease Control figures from 2017 reveal continued surges in violent deaths (including suicides, homicides, gun killings, and drug overdoses) among older Whites, concentrated in counties with large White majorities and strong Trump support. Increased arrests and imprisonments of Whites also plague Trump-voting counties.\n\nRight-wing voting and austerity policies exacerbate economic and social crises in those rural communities-and yet those crises paradoxically seem to reinforce intense support for Trump. Meanwhile, even as both Americas struggle with wealth inequality, the favorable demographics of healthier cities underlie their booms in investment and infrastructure improvements accompanying plummeting crime and violence.\n\nThis simple demographic reality may eventually achieve what endless political quarreling, court tests, and even elections can't-American reconciliation. At present, politics and institutions seem powerless to unite Americans. Trump supporters politically act so differently from other Americans, fearing other races and lifestyles , that White conservatives may be fundamentally unable to live with diversity and egalitarian democracy. On the other side, liberal, mostly urban zones will not accept right-wing onslaughts on environmental standards and the civil rights of immigrants, people of color, and LGBTQ people.\n\nStill, a practical consensus may result from an unavoidable reality: Races can't go it alone. Diversity isn't some post-modern amusement cooked up by liberals. Immigration isn't a favor to poorer countries. White Americans (whose dependency ratio is an insufficient 3:1 workers per senior nationwide) need Latino Americans (with their ratio of 8:1). Aging Western societies need immigrants and younger workers obtaining education, filling jobs, and paying taxes that support older Whites' income and health benefits.\n\nProgressives need to emphasize the facts of dependency and support to refute the Right's xenophobic crusade against immigration and diversity-first, to preserve immigration and immigrant rights; second, to push for democratic, one-person-one-vote representation as the antidote to racialized advantage; and third, to adopt a global perspective to replace the narrow, short-term mindset of nationalism.\n\nAttempting to \"win back\" rural voters with conservative rhetoric will be disastrous (it didn't work for Bill Clinton or Joe Biden ). Pro-diversity perspectives reflect the demographics of survival."

      "text": "In Trump's America, 'Christian' just means white identity politics\n\nEven amid the holiday pressures to turn away from the news cycle, it was enough to capture public attention: On Thursday, the day after the House formally impeached Donald Trump, Christianity Today, the flagship publication of evangelical America, published an opinion piece by editor in chief Mark Galli, arguing that Trump should be removed from office . In an essay that bends over backward to accommodate Republican talking points, Galli nonetheless argued that Trump is \"a near perfect example of a human being who is morally lost and confused\" and begs evangelicals to consider \"what an unbelieving world will say if you continue to brush off Mr. Trump's immoral words and behavior.\"\n\nGalli, however, is under no illusions that his speaking out will move the needle with white evangelicals. He told CNN, \"I don't have any imaginations that my editorial is going to shift their views on this matter.\"\n\nSure enough, a group of 177 evangelical leaders - led by Liberty University's head Jerry Falwell Jr., recently in the news for \"accidentally\" emailing revealing photos of his wife to multiple people and being photographed drinking and dancing in a nightclub, behavior forbidden to his students - released a letter denouncing Galli and complaining that he \"questioned the spiritual integrity and Christian witness of tens-of-millions of believers.\"\n\nWell, yeah. Because it's blatantly obvious that anyone who defends Trump's criminality at this point is not acting out of spiritual integrity, but the opposite - they're people who have abandoned any semblance of morality or decency in their lust for power.\n\nNot that the Christian right had much morality to abandon in the first place, as anyone who lived through the George W. Bush years can attest. Trump has simply revealed the large majority of white evangelical Christians for who they are: Not people motivated by sincere faith, but people who see \"Christian\" primarily as an identity marker that accompanies being white, a disdain for urban or metropolitan areas, and their self-identification as \"conservative.\" All of which is used to justify their belief they and members of their tribe are the only legitimate Americans, and deserve to hold and wield a vastly disproportionate share of political power.\n\nIf anything, Galli has been way too generous to evangelical Trump supporters, telling the Atlantic that they believe that defending Trump somehow offers \"good witness to the Gospel.\" No doubt there's a lot of posturing towards that end in conservative Christian circles, but it defies imagination that anyone actually believes that Trump will somehow help convert people to Christianity or convince them to walk the path of mercy and kindness preached by Jesus. In this instance, religious identification is just a cudgel, another way to define \"real\" Americans in the right-wing imagination against the cosmopolitan America that is racially diverse and broadly tolerant of Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, atheists and other assorted non-Christians.\n\nSure enough, when the Washington Post visited an evangelical church in Wisconsin , most people there hadn't read the Christianity Today editorial and had no intention of doing so. One congregant complained that the magazine has been taken over by the \"social justice movement\" and therefore should be considered as the voice of \"nonbelievers.\"\n\nObviously, the \"belief\" in question here has nothing to do with the gospel of Jesus Christ, who talked at length about valuing the downtrodden. It's a belief in the moral superiority of white conservatives and their right to rule over others, even when they are vastly outnumbered.\n\nI saw yet another example of this when I wrote an article last month expressing sadness about feeling alienated from the Christmas spirit, at a time when many members of my own family support a president who has repeatedly suggested that people like me should be imprisoned or even murdered .\n\nThe reaction I got from conservatives was not a message of Christian charity or compassion for my suffering, much less any self-reflection about what Jesus might say about a leader who encourages his followers to hate people for being different or for simply speaking the truth. Instead, the reaction was a concentrated effort to increase my pain as much as possible, and ideally to inflict emotional harm on a scale that might cause serious damage to my mental health. (They failed, to be clear. But the fact that \"Christians\" would do such a thing was instructive in itself.)\n\nThe principal harassment strategy was to track me down on social media, even on my Instagram feed, and flood it with \"Merry Christmas\" messages - from white male strangers - to taunt me for my personal grief. It's particularly interesting that this was the weapon of choice. These people are taking what they supposedly believe is the birth celebration of their lord and savior and using it as a hurtful weapon. Is that the behavior of people who have genuine faith in Jesus' message of mercy and kindness, or the behavior of people who use \"Christianity\" as an instrument of domination over others they see as inferior?\n\nMy experience is hardly unique. Stirred by years of Fox News lying to viewers and telling them that liberals are somehow trying to take Christmas away, conservatives have increasingly embraced the phrase \"Merry Christmas\" to mean, basically, \"F**k you\" to anyone that they've deemed less than legitimate Americans.\n\nDonald Trump himself has gone a long way towards encouraging this view of Christianity not as a faith of love and compassion, but as a label to divide \"real\" Americans from the non-persons. His reaction to the Christianity Today editorial was to claim that any Democrat elected in his stead would be a \"a Radical Left nonbeliever.\"\n\nThat language is utterly nonsensical if \"Christian\" is taken to was refer to a spiritual belief system. Leading Democratic candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren , Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden are all faithful followers of various Christian denominations. Sen. Bernie Sanders has said he identifies strongly with his Jewish heritage and has \"spiritual feelings,\" although he is not a member of a congregation. Contrast that with Trump, who could not name a single book of the Bible when claiming to be a big fan in a 2015 interview, and who tried to put money on the Communion plate during an obligatory church appearance during the 2016 campaign.\n\nFor Trump and his followers, being \"Christian\" is now almost totally divorced from any belief in or understanding of actual Christian theology. It's about defining the in-group vs. the out-group. Jesus Christ himself could return from the dead and Trumpian \"Christians\" like Falwell would denounce him as a \"nonbeliever\" in short order. It's not about believing in Jesus. It's about believing in Donald Trump - and in the white nationalist identity politics he represents.\n\nAmanda Marcotte is a politics writer for Salon.

      "text": "Sadism and the far right: How Freud explains why Republicans are killing themselves\n\nMore Americans are dying from the covid in states run by Republicans than in states run by Democrats. In terms of cold political calculation, Democratic governors are striving to save supporters from death. Yet Republican governors seem content hurtling supporters toward it.\n\nWhy would they do that? When the former president refused to help \"blue states\" battle the new coronavirus, it was disgraceful and sadistic. Yet it was understandable (again in cold political terms). You'd think the Republicans would want to help their base. But thinking that would mean you're thinking like a liberal. Republicans don't do that.\n\nWhen Republican leaders hurt their own - for instance, by fining business owners for asking customers to mask up, thus spreading the plague more widely - they are not undermining themselves. They are in fact feeding into an already established story about \"real Americans\" being the \"real victims\" while the real victims perpetuate political evil.\n\nHow do sadist policies work with masochistic outcomes to not undermine the whole project but instead deepen the commitment of Republican supporters to the cause of restoring America to greatness?\n\nFor an answer, I turned to Casey Ryan Kelly. He's a professor of rhetoric and public culture at the University of Nebraska -Lincoln. His latest book is called Apocalypse Man: The Death Drive and the Rhetoric of White Masculine Victimhood . In it, Professor Kelly applies Sigmund Freud's concept of \"the death drive\" to understanding not only the former president's incendiary rhetoric but also GOP incoherence.\n\nI sent him the above image in order to ask: Huh?\n\nI turned to the concept because I wanted to find what unified conservative incoherence. I was struck by, on the one hand, the GOP's obsession with grievance and victimhood and, on the other, their preoccupation with strength, power and other similar attributes\n\nYeah, right. How does one square that circle?\n\nFor nearly 40 years, conservatives have forged their political identity on the assumption that they have been exiled from politics and marginalized by changes in the culture.\n\nThe problem is you have to square this idea with the fact that conservatives have made huge political gains that have ostensibly resulted in minority rule.\n\nSo they have to reconcile this contradiction. There is so much legitimacy in being able to claim one is a victim that conservatives are often manufacturing their own marginalization with trivial \"culture war\" issues: \"critical race theory,\" confederate monuments, Antifa and Black Lives Matter and so on.\n\nThis is an intoxicating elixer, because conservatives become attached and invested in their identity as marginalized (for instance, \"reverse discrimination\" is a bigger issue that racial discrimination against minorities).\n\nMy argument is that they compulsively restage an encounter with their own subjugation, endless repeating grievances and enjoying doing so.\n\nThe case studies in my book articulate how conservatives become attached to victimhood, because it enables them to disavow their privileges and overwhelming dominance of politics\n\nSo even as they fear humiliation, they seek it out? Or create conditions in which they will experience humiliation?\n\nYes, the trick is to engineer situations that appear to be discriminatory or unfair but without actually conceding any real substantive power.\n\nFor example, take free speech controversies on college campuses.\n\nThe plan is to invite a very controversial conservative speaker to campus that sparks liberal protests. The speaker is disinvited or the speaker withdraws based out of fear of \"riots.\" Then the conservative news media run story after story about how oppressive campus culture is for conservatives.\n\nThere is very little at stake for conservatives but liberals come off as looking intolerant. Either they accept intolerant speech (like Milo Yiannapolis or Richard Spencer) or look like agents of intolerance.\n\nThe minor humiliation conservatives suffer from being disinvited pales in comparison to the cultural power they attain by looking like they are victims of discrimination.\n\nThey can then assert that white conservatives deserve to fairly engage in identity politics but from a position of material strength. It's a win-win.\n\nTrump is a great case study in this as well.\n\nHis speeches at rallies are an incessant list of grievances, mainly concerning how his loyal supporters have been humiliated and the world is laughing at them. It's almost masochistic, like a Friars Club roast. Then he offers to fight on their behalf to overcome their humiliation. They willingly concede and trust in his power.\n\nIt seems the Republicans achieve a win-win-win by eliciting sympathy, or the appearance of sympathy, from pundits and political actors who are invested in their public image of being politically neutral. Think of the \"anti-woke\" discourse that's been in vogue of late.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nThey get to look like they are the rational political center and anyone on the left who brings up evidence of historic and structural oppression is met with the demeaning label of \"woke\" or \"triggered.\" The left looks out of control, overly emotional and irrational.\n\nThe timing is right. Social justice made tremendous gains after the murder of George Floyd, which occurred amid a transparently racist administration. Now that Trump is gone, \"respectable white people,\" as I call them, and the press corps are more than happy to pile on to a white backlash that has been cascading since Biden's inauguration.\n\nConservatives are skilled at turning the tables on \"social justice.\"\n\nThere is a great book by Alyson Cole called the The Cult of True Victimhood: From the War on Welfare to the War on Terror (2006) in which she examines how the victim's rights movement is a perfect case study in how to portray the victims of discrimination in the criminal justice system as phony victims and the victims of crime as the true innocent victims of society.\n\nWhile that is about a very specific case of the criminal justice system, you can see the concept of true victimhood play out to nullify and delegitimize police protests and Black Lives Matter.\n\nLet's turn to Freud. Can you break down how his concepts apply? First, what's the death drive?\n\nFreud found that World War I soldiers continually re-experienced their battlefield trauma as something that was not in the past but something being experienced as happening to them in the present.\n\nHe found that patients would continually return to this trauma but without adequately mourning it. As a result, they carried their trauma with them everywhere and it became assimilated into their identity.\n\nHe called this condition \"melancholia.\"\n\nThis signaled to Freud (as he writes in Beyond the Pleasure Principle ) that all people compulsively repeat past experiences, and in doing so attempt to bind (or domesticate) the unpleasure of trauma, absence and loss.\n\nHe noted that his grandson used to throw a toy tethered to a string and say \"fort\" (gone) and retrieve the toy saying \"da\" (there). He argued that the child was domesticating the displeasure of his mother's absence, restaging his desire for her but in a scenario in which he controlled the absence and presence of the toy. His idea of \"compulsive repetition\" is that all people domesticate the displeasure of loss by revisiting past traumas.\n\nThe \"death drive\" for him is not so much a desire to return back to inorganic matter, but rather a compulsion to repeat that alleviated tension within the psyche by revisiting a moment in the past in which a person imagined themselves as being whole, complete and without psychic tension.\n\nCulturally speaking, the death drive manifests in public discourse that returns to a nostalgic scene of our prior selves before we were fractured by trauma (i.e., \"Make America Great Again\").\n\nThe trick is we were never \"whole\" or complete. We only imagine ourselves in that way to manage loss but sometimes without adequately mourning the past as the past.\n\nSo, in lay terms, we revisit traumatic moments to recover a version of ourselves that we believe to be coherent, stable and unified. The return is compulsive because we can never recover something we never had, so we do it perpetually.\n\nThat's what Trump does best, repeating himself. Is the rhetoric feeding the psychology or the psychology feeding the rhetoric?\n\nI would say both.\n\nTrump intones the same message repetitively: the world used to be better (sometime, anytime, in the past you wish to imagine). Your birthright entitlements were stripped from you: your history, your culture, your wealth were taken away by radical leftist democrats. Wouldn't it be nice to go back to when we didn't have to contend with so many mysterious and nefarious social forces (the 1950s or perhaps even earlier when people knew their place).\n\nThe repetition of this message invites his supporters to imagine themselves as victims of loss and trauma, and to long for a return to something better (even though the past was not any better. It had its problems too).\n\nThis taps into a psychical process we are all familiar with in how we might long for better days in the past. It's both a reflection of the death drive deflected into the culture and taps into the death drive by staging an encounter with a fantasy of ourselves when we were great.\n\nMore Americans continue to die of the covid in GOP-controlled states than otherwise. In a sense, the death drive is literally driving Republicans toward death. Freud didn't have that in mind, obviously.\n\nIndeed. I am fascinated with the notion that one must risk infection to demonstrate their conservative credentials. It is literalizing the death drive: prove your loyalty by avoiding any care or concern for your own health and safety. I've seen people call this getting covid to \"own the libs.\" Conservative governors are also literally killing off their voting base at the same time.\n\nThey are driven to endanger their lives in order to keep faith with an imagined past that they are compelled to return to in order to maximize their feelings of dislocation and humiliation in the present. I'm getting dizzy.\n\nIt's a wild ride to go through the logic. I guess the way it becomes consistent is if we understand the psychological need it serves.\n\nNothing is ultimately more humiliating than conceding that you are not a fully autonomous person who owes something to others. The death drive plus radical individualism creates a toxic politics.\n\nI don't mean to throw a curveball at you but ... I've been reading an interview from 1989 between Bill Moyers and Michael Josephson. This is what Josephson says:\n\n<QUOTE>The value of being ethical isn't simply that every day you get every single thing you want but, in the long haul, you feel better about it and you've created a better society, because the cumulative impact of you or I being selfish is a terribly selfish society where we don't know what to expect from people anymore.\n\nIf we translate the Golden Rule, \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,\" into \"do unto others as you think they will do unto you,\" or \"do unto others as they have done unto you,\" which are variations and excuses, we have an awful society.\n\nI thought of this when you mentioned \"radical individualism.\"\n\nWow, that comment ages pretty well. Once we disown that we have any debt or obligation to others, society becomes untenable.\n\nI saw this a lot in how doomsday preppers intensified the logic of individualism to such a degree that quite literally anything that embodies collective duties is an affront to their humanity.\n\nAs a result, they'd rather short sell the social contract and build bunkers and treat their neighbors as threats to their way of life.\n\nElsewhere, Josephson says a \"yuppie version of success\" -- by which he means \"greed is good\" -- is going to force you to make sacrifices. What he meant was sacrificing your ideals or your soul.\n\nBut in the current context, it's even more profound. The death drive creates conditions in which the smallest sacrifice -- wearing a mask -- is seen as an intolerable affront to your liberty. In refusing to sacrifice anything, they end up sacrificing everything, meaning die.\n\nIt seems to turn into a suicide pact. In conceding nothing to other people's needs and safety, you actually doom yourself and nothing is really gained, except for the satisfaction of knowing you were right (even as you are put onto a ventilator).\n\nLet's loop back to your book. Can you enlarge the idea of melancholia?\n\nMelancholia is a kind of nostalgic longing (at its root, nostalgia means an \"ache for home\"). But what distinguishes melancholia from nostalgia is that the past is not seen as the past but as something experienced as happening in the present.\n\nIn mourning a loss, we typically reconcile that the past is precisely that and that it can never be retrieved. Even if it could, it would do us no good. Mourning and even some forms of nostalgia revisit the past but to establish a healthy relationship to our losses.\n\nMelancholia represents a refusal to leave things in the past, and we develop an unhealthy and compulsive relationship. We cannot move past the event. The past begins to own us and actively shape our actions in the present. It's a fixation or habit we cannot kick.\n\nThe \"Lost Cause\" myth fits that, doesn't it?\n\nYes!"

      "text": "Democrats Are Still Chasing Rural White Voters, and It's a Strategy Doomed to Fail\n\nLeft-leaning political Twitter erupted in mockery on Thursday when the Democratic Party unveiled its cringeworthy new slogan: \"A Better Deal: Better Skills, Better Jobs, Better Wages\", which was not only bad on its own but painfully reminiscent of the Papa John's slogan . Despite the rush from many diehard Bernie Sanders acolytes to write off the slogan as neoliberal business-as-usual Democratic nonsense , the reality is that the slogan reflects Democratic efforts to incorporate the criticisms of those who argue that Democrats should abandon the emphasis on \"identity politics\" and instead try to woo white working-class voters with populist economic policies.\n\n\"Democrats jettisoned social and foreign policy issues for this exercise, eschewing the identity politics and box-checking that has plagued Democratic campaigns in the past, most recently Hillary Clinton's. This will be purely an economic message,\" writes Dana Milbank for the Washington Post . \"This is meant to be a populist manifesto that doesn't conform to the left/right debate but instead aims to align Democrats with ordinary, middle-class Americans fighting powerful special interests.\"\n\nIt's a tempting idea, of course: Just stop talking so much about racism and sexism so much and instead talk about jobs and wages ( never mind that Hillary Clinton actually did focus more on jobs and wages than any other issue ) and boom! Watch the white rural voters that handed states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan to Donald Trump come into the Democratic fold.\n\nWho doesn't want to believe liberals have that much control - that Democrats alone could make the cultural struggles tearing apart this country go away by putting the focus on jobs and other economic issues, and watch white voters return to the flock, drawn by all those progressive policies?\n\nThe problem is, and continues to be, that there's no evidence for this. The roller-coaster politics around health care really drive home how much Republican base voters view politics through a culture-war lens. Progressive policy is, however appealing in the abstract, is a secondary concern to the desire of angry white conservatives to exert or reassert their cultural dominance. Which goes a long way towards explaining the loathing of Obamacare: It was the \"Obama\" part, not the \"care\" part, that riled up the GOP base. Now that Barack Obama is gone, anger over the health care bill is rapidly receding.\n\nOn Thursday, the New York Times published interviews with some of those rural whites in Pennsylvania who have become such desirable voters and found that the law they so loathed when Barack Obama was in office has, now that there's a Republican in charge, stopped offending them so much.\n\n\"I can't even remember why I opposed it,\" said Patrick Murphy, who owns Bagel Barrel, on a quaint and bustling street near Mr. Brahin's law office here in Doylestown. ...\n\n\"Everybody needs some sort of health insurance,\" Mr. Murphy said. \"They're trying to repeal Obamacare but they don't have anything in place.\"\n\nThe percentage of Republicans who want to see Obamacare repealed is declining. Over three-quarters of Republicans demanded repeal a year ago , but now fewer than 60 percent support the Republican plan to do so.\n\nThis rapid shift makes sense if one views conservative politics through a culture-war lens. The problem for Republicans with Obamacare wasn't that it offended some sense of fiscal conservatism. It's that it was President Obama's signature legislative achievement, and many white conservatives hated Obama because - simply by being black and intelligent and urbane and a Democrat - reminded them of the declining cultural dominance of conservative Christian whites like themselves. Electing Trump has allowed this group of voters to believe they are culturally ascendant again - and repealing Obamacare, which was always mostly about sticking it to the liberals, has lot much of its salience as an issue.\n\nThese voters aren't really moved by policy. Hell, 41 percent of Republican voters actually want a single-payer system. The issue isn't with Democratic policy, but with Democrats , who are perceived as snooty, educated, racially diverse city-dwellers, and therefore hated. Even if Democratic politicians tried to abandon \"identity politics\" entirely, it wouldn't matter. Conservative voters can see, with their own two eyes, that the nation is changing culturally. They will continue to use the Republican Party as a cudgel to beat up the people that threaten them.\n\nThis recent New Yorker article about Trump country is a sobering reminder of these dynamics. No one seems to believe that the problem with the Democrats is that they aren't doing enough to raise wages. Instead, there's an inchoate anger over cultural changes that largely fall outside either party's control. It's telling that the media was the \"enemy\" Trump was best able to whip up rage against among crowds in rural areas.  Journalists are the Fox News-assigned symbol of the cosmopolitanism that the Trump-voting masses see as a threat to their cultural dominance.\n\nNone of this is to say that Democrats shouldn't embrace progressive policies. If anything, they need to be bolder and offer a more robust health care safety net (such as an option to buy into Medicaid) and a guaranteed jobs program. But doing this in hopes of winning over rural white voters is a fool's errand. Those voters mostly aren't voting their economic self-interest, and won't start doing so anytime soon. Instead, they are clinging to a mythological past of Christian white dominance, and the Republicans, especially Donald Trump, are promising to restore it.\n\nWhat Democrats need to do instead is harness those cultural changes that Republican voters resent, and turn them towards this progressive agenda. Which is a fancy way of saying that they need to give up chasing white voters and instead put their resources towards organizing voters of color, as well as urban whites (particularly women), who embrace these cultural shifts, and try to increase turnout with those groups.\n\nThat will require not just a robustly progressive agenda, but continued attention to fighting racism, sexism and homophobia, in order to signal to voters of color, LGBT voters and women that Democrats see the Republican assaults on their rights and are ready to fight back. The coalition that Obama and Clinton built is a good one, and if more of the people in it could be persuaded to vote, the Democrats would start winning more elections. It's not a sexy path forward, perhaps, but it's the one that has a chance of working."

      "text": "Why White People Freak Out When They're Called Out About Race\n\nStop me if you've heard this one.\n\nLast year, a white male Princeton undergraduate was asked by a classmate to \"check his privilege.\" Offended by this suggestion, he shot off a 1,300-word essay to the Tory , a right-wing campus newspaper . In it, he wrote about his grandfather who fled the Nazis to Siberia, his grandmother who survived a concentration camp in Germany, about the humble wicker basket business they started in America. He railed against his classmates for \"diminishing everything [he'd] accomplished, all the hard work [he'd] done.\"\n\nHis missive was reprinted by Time . He was interviewed by the New York Times and appeared on Fox News. He became a darling of white conservatives across the country.\n\nWhat he did not do, at any point, was consider whether being white and male might have given him-if not his ancestors-some advantage in achieving incredible success in America. He did not, in other words, check his privilege.\n\nTo Robin DiAngelo, professor of multicutural education at Westfield State University and author of What Does it Mean to Be White? Developing White Racial Literacy , Tal Fortgang's essay -indignant, defensive, beside-the-point, somehow both self-pitying and self-aggrandizing-followed a familiar script. As an anti-racist educator for more than two decades, DiAngelo has heard versions of it recited hundreds of times by white men and women in her workshops.\n\nShe's heard it so many times, in fact, that she came up with a term for it: \"white fragility,\" which she defined in a 2011 journal article as \"a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves. These moves include outward display of emotions such as anger, fear and guilt, and behaviors such as argumentation, silence and leaving the stress-inducing situation.\"\n\nWhen the Black Lives Matter movement marched in the streets, holding up traffic, disrupting commerce, and refusing to allow \"normal life\" to resume-insofar as normalcy means a system that permits police and vigilantes to murder black men and women with impunity-white people found themselves in tense conversations online, with friends and in the media about privilege, white supremacy and racism. You could say white fragility was at an all-time high.\n\nI spoke with DiAngelo about how to deal with all the fragile white people, and why it's worth doing so.\n\nSam Adler-Bell: How did you come to write about \"white fragility\"?\n\nRobin DiAngelo: To be honest, I wanted to take it on because it's a frustrating dynamic that I encounter a lot. I don't have a lot of patience for it. And I wanted to put a mirror to it.\n\nI do atypical work for a white person, which is that I lead primarily white audiences in discussions on race every day, in workshops all over the country. That has allowed me to observe very predictable patterns. And one of those patterns is this inability to tolerate any kind of challenge to our racial reality. We shut down or lash out or in whatever way possible block any reflection from taking place.\n\nOf course, it functions as means of resistance, but I think it's also useful to think about it as fragility, as inability to handle the stress of conversations about race and racism\n\nSometimes it's strategic, a very intentional push back and rebuttal. But a lot of the time, the person simply cannot function. They regress into an emotional state that prevents anybody from moving forward.\n\nSAB: Carla Murphy recently referenced \"white fragility\" in an article for Colorlines , and I've seen it referenced on Twitter and Facebook a lot lately. It seems like it's having a moment. Why do you think that is?\n\nRD: I think we get tired of certain terms. What I do used to be called \"diversity training,\" then \"cultural competency\" and now, \"anti-racism.\" These terms are really useful for periods of time, but then they get coopted, and people build all this baggage around them, and you have to come up with new terms or else people won't engage.\n\nAnd I think \"white privilege\" has reached that point. It rocked my world when I first really got it, when I came across Peggy McIntosh . It's a really powerful start for people. But unfortunately it's been played so much now that it turns people off.\n\nSAB: What causes white fragility to set in?\n\nRD: For white people, their identities rest on the idea of racism as about good or bad people, about moral or immoral singular acts, and if we're good, moral people we can't be racist - we don't engage in those acts. This is one of the most effective adaptations of racism over time-that we can think of racism as only something that individuals either are or are not \"doing.\"\n\nIn large part, white fragility-the defensiveness, the fear of conflict-is rooted in this good/bad binary. If you call someone out, they think to themselves, \"What you just said was that I am a bad person, and that is intolerable to me.\" It's a deep challenge to the core of our identity as good, moral people.\n\nThe good/bad binary is also what leads to the very unhelpful phenomenon of un-friending on Facebook.\n\nSAB: Right, because the instinct is to un-friend, to dissociate from those bad white people, so that I'm not implicated in their badness.\n\nRD: When I'm doing a workshop with white people, I'll often say, \"If we don't work with each other, if we give in to that pull to separate, who have we left to deal with the white person that we've given up on and won't address?\n\nSAB: A person of color.\n\nRD: Exactly. And white fragility also comes from a deep sense of entitlement. Think about it like this: from the time I opened my eyes, I have been told that as a white person, I am superior to people of color. There's never been a space in which I have not been receiving that message. From what hospital I was allowed to be born in, to how my mother was treated by the staff, to who owned the hospital, to who cleaned the rooms and took out the garbage. We are born into a racial hierarchy, and every interaction with media and culture confirms it-our sense that, at a fundamental level, we are superior.\n\nAnd, the thing is, it feels good. Even though it contradicts our most basic principles and values. So we know it, but we can never admit it. It creates this kind of dangerous internal stew that gets enacted externally in our interactions with people of color, and is crazy-making for people of color. We have set the world up to preserve that internal sense of superiority and also resist challenges to it. All while denying that anything is going on and insisting that race is meaningless to us.\n\nSAB: Something that amazes me is the sophistication of some white people's defensive maneuvers. I have a black friend who was accused of \"online harassment\" by a white friend after he called her out in a harsh way. What do you see going on there?\n\nRD: First of all, whites often confuse comfort with safety. We say we don't feel safe, when what we mean is that we don't feel comfortable . Secondly, no white person looks at a person of color through objective eyes. There's been a lot of research in this area. Cross-racially, we do not see with objective eyes. Now you add that he's a black man. It's not a fluke that she picked the word \"harassed.\" In doing that, she's reinforcing a really classic, racist paradigm: White women and black men. White women's frailty and black men's aggressiveness and danger.\n\nBut even if she is feeling that, which she very well may be, we should be suspicious of our feelings in these interactions. There's no such thing as pure feeling. You have a feeling because you've filtered the experience through a particular lens. The feeling is the outcome. It probably feels natural, but of course it's shaped by what you believe.\n\nSAB: There's also the issue of \"tone-policing\" here, right?\n\nRD: Yes. One of the things I try to work with white people on is letting go of our criteria about how people of color give us feedback. We have to build our stamina to just be humble and bear witness to the pain we've caused.\n\nIn my workshops, one of the things I like to ask white people is, \"What are the rules for how people of color should give us feedback about our racism? What are the rules, where did you get them, and whom do they serve?\" Usually those questions alone make the point.\n\nIt's like if you're standing on my head and I say, \"Get off my head,\" and you respond, \"Well, you need to tell me nicely.\" I'd be like, \"No. Fuck you. Get off my fucking head.\"\n\nIn the course of my work, I've had many people of color give me feedback in ways that might be perceived as intense or emotional or angry. And on one level, it's personal-I did do that thing that triggered the response, but at the same time it isn't only personal. I represent a lifetime of people that have hurt them in the same way that I just did.\n\nAnd, honestly, the fact that they are willing to show me demonstrates, on some level, that they trust me.\n\nSAB: What do you mean?\n\nRD: If people of color went around showing the pain they feel in every moment that they feel it, they could be killed. It is dangerous. They cannot always share their outrage about the injustice of racism. White people can't tolerate it. And we punish it severely-from job loss, to violence, to murder.\n\nFor them to take that risk and show us, that is a moment of trust. I say, bring it on, thank you.\n\nWhen I'm doing a workshop, I'll often ask the people of color in the room, somewhat facetiously, \"How often have you given white people feedback about our inevitable and often unconscious racist patterns and had that go well for you?\" And they laugh.\n\nBecause it just doesn't go well. And so one time I asked, \"What would your daily life be like if you could just simply give us feedback, have us receive it graciously, reflect on it and work to change the behavior? What would your life be like?\"\n\nAnd this one man of color looked at me and said, \"It would be revolutionary .\"\n\nSAB: I notice as we've been talking that you almost always use the word \"we\" when describing white people's tendencies. Can you tell me why you do that?\n\nRD: Well, for one, I'm white (and you're white). And even as committed as I am, I'm not outside of anything that I'm talking about here. If I went around saying white people this and white people that, it would be a distancing move. I don't want to reinforce the idea that there are some whites who are done, and others that still need work. There's no being finished.\n\nPlus, in my work, I'm usually addressing white audiences, and the \"we\" diminishes defensiveness somewhat. It makes them more comfortable. They see that I'm not just pointing fingers outward.\n\nSAB: Do you ever worry about re-centering whiteness?\n\nRD: Well, yes. I continually struggle with that reality. By standing up there as an authority on whiteness, I'm necessarily reinforcing my authority as a white person. It goes with the territory. For example, you're interviewing me now, on whiteness, and people of color have been saying these things for a very long time.\n\nOn the one hand, I know that in many ways, white people can hear me in a way that they can't hear people of color. They listen. So by god, I'm going to use my voice to challenge racism. The only alternative I can see is to not speak up and challenge racism. And that is not acceptable to me.\n\nIt's sort of a master's tools dilemma.\n\nSAB: Yes, and racism is something that everyone thinks they're an authority on.\n\nRD: That drives me crazy. I'll run into someone I haven't seen in 20 years in the grocery store, and they'll say, \"Hi! What've you been doing?\"\n\nAnd I say, \"I got my Ph.D.\"\n\nAnd they say, \"Oh wow, what in?\"\n\n\"Race relations and white racial identity.\"\n\nAnd they'll go \"Oh, well you know. People just need to-\"\n\nAs if they're going to give me the one-sentence answer to arguably the most challenging social dynamic of our time. Like, hey, why did I knock myself out for 20 years studying, researching, and challenging this within myself and others? I should have just come to you! And the answer is so simple! I've never heard that one before!\n\nImagine if I was an astronomer. Everybody has a basic understanding of the sky, but they would not debate an astronomer on astronomy. The arrogance of white people faced with questions of race is unbelievable."

      "text": "Here's Why Republicans' Disturbing Romance with the Racist Confederacy Is So Troubling\n\nAmong the historical ironies of our current era is the defense of Confederate monuments and southern white \"heritage\" by Republicans. The curious path that the Grand Old Party of Abraham Lincoln has followed to its present stance is an example of expediency and ideology subverting principle.\n\nFor more than a century after the Civil War, the defense of white southern \"heritage\" was the preoccupation of white Democrats. Until the 1970s, Republicans in the South were a long suffering minority who had to battle against all manner of Democratic machinations to enfeeble their opponents. The party recruited African Americans-who remained loyal to the party of Lincoln and hostile to the white segregationists who still presided over the Democratic Party in the region-and whites who favored Republican policies and were less enchanted by white supremacy than their Democratic rivals. Southern Republicans were often vocal opponents of the poll tax and other Democratic schemes that suppressed voter turnout and impeded equal representation in state houses. Nationally, Republican ranks included moderates and liberals whose commitment to racial equality was crucial for the expansion of civil rights from the Civil War until the election of Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe Republican embrace of the white southern heritage began in 1972 as part of President Richard Nixon's reelection campaign. Nixon believed he had to fend off arch-segregationist George Wallace while retaining the support of a \"silent majority\" alienated by the Democratic Party's liberalism. Republican strategists sought to peel off white voters in the South who recoiled from the Democrats' commitment to affirmative action, school desegregation, and opposition to the Vietnam War. This so-called \"Southern Strategy,\" which appealed to white suburban southerners who were anxious to preserve de facto segregation in the suburbs, allowed the Republican Party to exploit the anxieties of whites in the South and beyond without having to categorically oppose racial integration. By fulminating against urban crime, court-ordered school busing, and excessively generous welfare programs, Nixon portrayed the Democrats as pressing too fast and too far to force integration. Even while Nixon avoided the fire-breathing racism of George Wallace, white voters had little difficulty discerning the Republicans' message. After the 1972 election, Nixon's special counsel John Ehrlichman acknowledged that \"the subliminal appeal to the anti-black voter was always present in Nixon's statements and speeches.\"\n\nDespite the success of the Republicans' strategy in 1972, the Democratic Party retained the allegiance of many white southerners through the 1970s. From Virginia to Mississippi, Democratic officeholders included old-line segregationists who only grudgingly acceded to the new reality of growing black political empowerment. Ensconced in positions of power by seniority, these Democratic politicos showered federal and state largesse on their districts while playing up their regional loyalties in thick southern accents.\n\nOnly in hindsight is it evident that 1972 marked the emergence of the new face of Republicanism in the South: Jesse Helms. The significance of Helms' successful Senate campaign that year was obscured by the contemporaneous election of moderate white politicians elsewhere in the region, and especially by the triumph of Jimmy Carter in his 1976 campaign for the White House. Observers were too quick to assume that any lingering legacies of Jim Crow would soon be swept away in the \"new New South.\"\n\nHelms had previously been a minor figure in national affairs even while he pioneered the politics of white resentment in North Carolina. Taking advantage of his position as an executive at a Raleigh, North Carolina, television station during the 1960s, he had begun delivering nightly broadcast editorials. He honed a stridently conservative message that he presented as down home, common sense traditional values. Americans, Helms growled, were besieged by nihilists, communists, and other radicals intent on undermining Christian and American values. He did not need to literally wave the Confederate flag to reassure whites that he would protect their interests and defend southern \"heritage.\" His accent, his invocations of traditional values, and his visceral contempt for civil rights activism made such appeals superfluous.\n\nRonald Reagan's 1980 campaign and subsequent presidency was the death knell of the party of Lincoln. Reagan himself evidenced little sympathy for Confederate heritage, but he courted anyone who was receptive or sympathetic to his caricature of \"tax and spend\" liberalism. During his presidential campaign, he made it clear that he wasn't embarrassed to glad-hand race-mongers like George Wallace and voters who had previously championed segregation. Notably, he delivered a major campaign speech endorsing \"states' rights\" at the Neshoba County Fair in Philadelphia, Mississippi. Lee Atwater, a Republican consultant who had an outsized role in the Republican presidential campaigns during the 1980s, revealed the logic behind the invocation of \"states' rights\" by Reagan (and other Republicans): \"By 1968 you can't say 'nigger'-that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states' rights, and all that stuff.\" Observers dwelled on the symbolism of his invocation of states' rights within a few miles of the site where the Ku Klux Klan had murdered three civil rights activists in 1964. But many overlooked the cultural symbolism of the specific site of his speech, the Neshoba County Fair. In 1980 (and virtually to the present), the fair is a festival of white Mississippi culture during which black musicians perform, black chefs cook, and black service workers tend to the needs of white fairgoers who reside in elaborate \"cabins\" on the fairgrounds. The fair is as close to a whites-only utopia as Mississippi has to offer. No location was more fitting for Reagan's implicit renunciation of a century of Republican commitment to equality.\n\nReagan's handiwork prepared the way for the surprisingly rapid consolidation of Republican strength in the South. Reagan's version of Republicanism purged most of the liberals and moderates lingering in the party's ranks. Free-market ideologues and Christian conservatives who shared a contempt for liberal \"social engineering\" and a hatred of communism assumed their places. Meanwhile, retirements thinned the ranks of old-time Democrats who still commanded loyalty in the hinterlands of the white South.\n\nJesse Helms' tenacious opposition to the establishment of a national holiday in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. was a sign of how far the party of Lincoln had traveled in only a few years. Helms, with the aid of John Porter East (another North Carolina Republican), mocked King's historical importance, criticized his opposition to the Vietnam War, and tarred him as a communist. Reagan gave credence to Helms' slanders until finally caving in and signing the legislation creating the holiday in 1983. Helms, Reagan, and the naysayers had made their point even in defeat; any observer understood that Republican support for the holiday was half-hearted at best and that, in the eyes of many conservatives, it was a tawdry concession to illegitimate \"special interests.\"\n\nYoking the Republican Party to the Defense of Confederate Heritage\n\nConfederate symbols to the cause of fanning the resentments of white southerners was by no means the exclusive work of Republican politicians. The Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV), neo-Confederates, and avowed white supremacists in the region played a crucial role during the 1980s and 1990s. Founded in 1896, the SCV failed for nearly a century to muster a large membership or to exercise much cultural authority. But during the 1970s and 1980s, its ranks were invigorated by new recruits, including Civil War reenactors and men vigilant against any insults to southern white \"heritage.\" Included in the membership of the SCV were white supremacists who looked to the Confederacy as inspiration for the creation of a white Euro-American homeland. The League of the South, a neo-Confederate and white supremacist organization founded in 1994, added a patina of intellectual rigor to the Confederate revival. Together, the SCV, the League of the South, and their allies warned white southerners that cosmopolitan academics, liberal and irreligious politicians, foreign organizations, and other sinister forces were intent on the destruction of the white South's values and heritage. Attacks on the symbols of the Confederacy were one manifestation of this nihilism run amok. While liberals applauded the tentative first steps in the creation of a pluralist South that incorporated everyone into civic life, neo-Confederates angrily countered that the South historically had been and should remain an Anglo-Celtic homeland. Equally important, when the white South launched the Confederacy, it purportedly had come closer than any previous or subsequent society to creating the ideal Christian republic. The defense of white southern \"heritage\" was, literally, the defense of everything that was sacred.\n\nWith gathering energy during the 1990s, the SCV picketed, lobbied, campaigned, and litigated to prevent \"heritage violations,\" which included \"any attack upon our Confederate Heritage, or the flags, monuments, and symbols which represent it.\" Particular energy was devoted to bringing suit against countless school districts and municipalities that sought to restrict the public display of the Confederate Battle Flag. Although the SCV usually failed in these efforts, it stoked the fears and resentments of members and allies who were steeped in a white regional memory that dwelled on white southerners' victimhood at the hands of Union generals, liberal judges, northern legislators, and outside agitators.\n\nThis defense of Confederate heritage increasingly contaminated the region's public life during the 1990s. At the same time that activists within the SCV gained control of the organization, Republicans grasped that Confederate symbols could be used as a wedge issue to loosen the weakening grip of Democratic politicians on the rural South. Georgia provided a vivid illustration of the dangers for Democrats of tangling with Confederate heritage. Throughout the 1990s, state politics were roiled by demands to change the state flag, which segregationist politicians had redesigned to include the Confederate Battle Flag in response to the Supreme Court's 1954 landmark Brown V. Board of Education decision. When the 1996 Olympics brought international scrutiny to Atlanta and the state, Democrats and some business leaders advocated the removal of the divisive Confederate symbol from the state flag. But other politicians, especially Republicans, exploited the issue to depict Democrats as captives of black activists and outsider business elites hostile to white southern heritage. During the 2002 gubernatorial campaign, Republicans pummeled Democratic Governor Roy Barnes for his role in the adoption of a new state flag, rallying the support of rural white males who harbored grievances against what they perceived to be metropolitan, liberal, and elitist policies. In the hands of Republican candidate Sonny Perdue's campaign, the new state flag became a symbol of \"political correctness,\" affirmative action, multiculturalism, moral laxity, and other perceived modern ills. Similar battle lines emerged elsewhere, including Alabama and Mississippi, whose state flags also incorporated the Confederate battle flag. In South Carolina, controversy arose over the display of the Confederate flag above the statehouse.\n\nWith the alliance between neo-Confederates and the Republican Party cemented by the end of the 1990s, it became commonplace for Republican politicos to boast of their devotion to southern \"heritage.\" Texas congressman Ron Paul, for example, was a steadfast defender of the Confederacy and an even more ardent champion of the Confederate constitution. When asked whether he favored secession, Paul readily answered yes, \"the states should be able to secede.\" But, he lamented, \"that principle was destroyed with the Civil War.\" The Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity has been outspoken in defending the display of the Confederate Battle Flag. When Rick Perry, a member of the SCV, was governor of Texas, he repeatedly expressed enthusiasm for secession and pondered whether Texas should secede.\n\nThe Contemporary Politics of White \"Heritage\"\n\nWhite \"heritage\" organizations circulated \"voters' guides\" that almost exclusively endorsed arch-conservative Republican politicians like Congressman Paul and Haley Barbour of Mississippi. In several southern states, especially Mississippi and South Carolina, leading Republican politicians welcomed the support of reactionary white nationalist organizations. Governor Kirk Fordice of Mississippi and Senator Trent Lott, for instance, displayed no embarrassment about meeting repeatedly with the Council of Conservative Citizens, an organization that continued to oppose integration and racial equality into the 21st century. The rare Republican who strayed from the party's new Confederate orthodoxy risked a furious backlash, as Governor Jim Gilmore of Virginia learned in 1998. He used his Confederate History Month proclamation (the month had been a state tradition for decades) to denounce slavery, prompting R. Wayne Byrd, the state president of the Heritage Preservation Association, to warn that he would suffer for his \"shameful attempt...to pander to racist hate groups like the NAACP.\" Subsequent Republican politicians during the 2000s were loath to cross defenders of Confederate heritage.\n\nIndeed, only extraordinary circumstances persuaded southern Republicans to reevaluate their now steadfast defense of all things Confederate. Not until after the 2015 massacre of nine African Americans at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, by Dylann Roof, a white supremacist, did Republican leaders of the state grudgingly furl the Confederate battle flag that had graced the state capitol grounds for decades. Before his murderous attack, Roof had immersed himself in the websites of the Council of Conservative Citizens and other white nationalist organizations that fomented racist stereotypes and myths about black criminality. Roof also had educated himself in his race hatred by touring slavery-related historical sites in North and South Carolina and visiting shrines to the Confederacy. When photographs of Roof posing with the Confederate battle flag circulated after the massacre, even some die-hard Confederate apologists conceded that the time-worn defense of the flag as a symbol of \"heritage, not hate\" rang hollow. The continuing display of the battle flag on the state capitol grounds became a particular flashpoint. The flag had first been raised over the state capitol in 1962 by order of the state's governor, Democrat Ernest Hollings, as a protest against desegregation. In 2000, after sustained demonstrations and a boycott by the NAACP, the flag was moved from atop the building to a flagpole incorporated into a Confederate memorial located in front of the capitol. There it remained until three weeks after Roof's violent spree, when it was finally taken down.\n\nThe removal of the Confederate battle flag from the South Carolina capitol grounds was widely applauded as evidence of statesmanship and a new commitment to reconciliation within Republican ranks in the state and the South. Yet arguably the most important response by Republicans to the banishing of the Confederate battle flag from public space has been the proliferation of \"heritage protection\" laws. While Republicans retreated from defending the Confederate flag, they nevertheless were steadfast in their devotion to the preservation of Confederate monuments in the public spaces of the South. Alarmed first by the outcry after Roof's rampage, and then subsequently by the desecration of Confederate monuments by activists energized by the Black Lives Matter movement, Republican legislators in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia took the lead in passing laws that imposed onerous requirements, typically including legislative approval, to alter names on buildings or to move or remove monuments. Riddled with legal ambiguities and resting on untested claims of legislative authority, these laws pose hardships on any communities intent on revising their civic landscapes. Communities graced with teams of lawyers may test the laws or try to navigate the legislatures, but their attempts almost certainly will end up in state or federal court. In the meantime, the contemporary landscape of the South, which is cluttered with thousands of memorials to the Confederacy, will remain frozen for the foreseeable future.\n\nAfter white nationalists, neo-Confederates, and others staged a violent protest to oppose the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee from a municipal park in Charlottesville on August 12, 2017, white conservatives sought to divorce themselves from racist extremists even while defending those in Charlottesville who had rallied to celebrate Confederate heritage. President Trump's public comments three days after the tragic death of Heather D. Heyer, a counter-protester in Charlottesville, included a mash-up of arguments that had long circulated among Confederate apologists for two decades. He warned against the erasure of history and suggested that \"good people\" had been present among the crowds of white nationalists. In subsequent comments, the conservative commentators drew comparisons between the campaign to remove Confederate symbols and the destruction of ancient monuments by ISIS in Syria and the Taliban in Afghanistan and Jewish art in Nazi Germany, implying a moral equivalency between American anti-Confederate activists and the most reviled extremist enemies of the United States. Such remarks were consistent with the long-familiar tactic of attacking the NAACP, which advocated boycotts against states that prominently honored the Confederacy, as a racist hate group. Remarkably, since 2017 Trump and other Republicans have implied that opposition to the preservation of Confederate heritage is un-American. And thus, the party that was responsible for preserving the Union is now offering a full-throated defense of naked symbols of treason associated with a war that claimed more American lives that all other conflicts combined.\n\nIf the curious history of the Republican Party's embrace of Confederate heritage did not have such corrosive consequences, we might dismiss it as farcical. But in the current environment, this history is tragic. At present, white conservatives apparently are unwilling to consider even token concessions to opponents of Confederate symbols except in the wake of horrific acts of violence like Roof's massacre. And with laws in at six southern states that are intended to impede the removal of Confederate and other divisive memorials, the only path forward is to either elect new legislators or challenge the laws in the courts. Neither course of action is likely to defuse the issue in the near future or to bring to an end the Republican Party's romance with the Confederacy.\n\nThis article was produced by Make It Right , a project of the Independent Media Institute."

      "text": "What Old, White Conservatives Miss About America\n\nTheir nostalgia isn't necessarily bigoted. The main reason people feel wistful for less racially enlightened times is that everyone romanticizes childhood.\n\nIs the nostalgia white conservatives feel for the America of their youth rooted in racism, as Matthew Yglesias contends ? Or is Reihan Salam right to \" resist and resent \" the notion that American conservatism is rooted in racist sentiment, a view that he says is held by many on the left? Those are the questions at issue in the recent back-and-forth between these two Atlantic alums, both of whom are unusually sharp observers of American politics and culture. Salam kicked things off by writing a column for The Daily that includes this provocative paragraph:\n\nYglesias responded as follows:\n\nThought-provoking arguments on both sides.\n\nWhat I'd ask Salam is whether he thinks the character Clint Eastwood plays in Grand Turino was racist. He seems like a good test case, in that he was understandably alarmed by a changing cultural landscape that made his neighborhood less safe, but he also erroneously presumed, based on the skin color of his neighbors, a larger gulf in cultural values than was justified by reality. (I'd say that he was a bit racist, but that he wasn't deserving of the full stigma usually attached to the term -- one can be racist without being Bull Connor or David Duke, and the lack of specific term for that is a real obstacle to frank racial conversation in the United States.)\n\nAs for Yglesias, I am in concurrence with his strong belief that America is a much better place today than it was in 1949. With few exceptions, to think otherwise signals a lack of cross-racial empathy, at minimum. But I resist the idea that there is nothing save white privilege for John Boehner to wistfully miss. He's a conservative Catholic. As a kid, he lived in a country where religion played a larger role in public life; divorce, premarital sex, and cohabitation were stigmatized; a comparatively larger share of social welfare spending came from private charities; abortion was much less common; and city bureaucrats would never dream of shutting down a kid's lemonade stand. All good things if you're a conservative Catholic, aren't they?\n\nOf course, all this presumes nostalgia is rational.\n\nBut almost every older American one encounters is nostalgic for the era of his or her youth. Hasn't it always been so? (For one thing, they were young back then!) One of the magazine pieces I found most rewarding to report concerns a senior center in Harlem, and the elderly black people who frequent it.\n\nHere's the beginning of the piece :\n\nThey do!\n\nIn that senior center, I encountered a bit of racism from some residents who complained about the Dominican immigrants who'd moved into the neighborhood over the years. Certainly you can tell a story about immigration, gentrification, and a relative loss of black privilege in West Harlem.\n\nFor the most part, however, folks had fond memories of youth, lamented that cultural institutions like the Savoy Ballroom no longer existed, complained about rising crime especially when perpetrated by members of their own racial group, and offered all the standard grandparent complaints too: the kids these days, with their informal dress, lack of respect for elders, affinity for talentless musicians, etc.\n\nOlder white conservatives are the same way. Yeah, some are racist in ways that make me uncomfortable. Others aren't racist at all. And among both groups, there are a lot of senior citizens who think the country of their youth is slipping away.\n\nAnd they're right!\n\nAmerica is radically more socially liberal than it was in 1949. Its television programs are cruder and filled with violence. Its out-of-wedlock birthrate is skyrocketing. Attitudes toward drug use are significantly more permissive. Far fewer businesses shut down to observe the Sabbath. Children are much more likely to be placed in daycare while both parents work outside the home. Gays are allowed in the military. College orientation now includes free condoms. Whatever one thinks of all these changes, it seems to me that Jim Crow and the Civil Rights Movement were major enough events that, based on them alone, America should be deemed better today, even in the eyes of folks who think other stuff has gone in the wrong direction.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that older white people -- or older black people -- must stop being nostalgic about less racially enlightened times, or that their wistfulness is grounded in racism, or that it's even possible for a human being to rationally evaluate the overall system of norms into which he was raised, to rationally compare them to prevailing norms many decades later, and then to judge which period was better and have it alone determine his emotional reaction.\n\nWhich brings us back to Boehner. No, Obama isn't snuffing out the America of his youth, but the fact that the House speaker claimed otherwise isn't a reflection of racist nostalgia so much as it is another example of a prominent Republican exaggerating the supposed radicalism of Obama's domestic agenda and economic policy. \"Does he feel nostalgic for the higher marginal tax rates of the America he grew up in?\" Yglesias asks. \"For the much larger labor union share of the workforce?\"\n\nSeriously?\n\nWhat are the chances that Boehner believes his own hyperbolic soundbite? Or that his genuinely felt nostalgia for the America of his childhood is informed by rationally comparing marginal tax rates when he was 9 to public policy today? Do people feel nostalgic for abstract public policy?\n\nThey do not.\n\nImage credit: Reuters"

Letting the Democrat win, in other words, would doom the country.\n\nTrump supporters' rampage on Wednesday represented a bracingly physical expression of that belief-and a bitterly ironic inversion of it. To save the country, in their eyes, the pro-Trump rioters assaulted the same building that the actual Flight 93 passengers died to protect.\n\nThe riot showed how the ominous tenor of contemporary Republican messaging could be fueling white conservatives' extremism. For at least the past decade, GOP candidates and conservative-media personalities have routinely deployed rhetoric similar to the Flight 93 argument. Only about 40 hours before the insurrection, at a campaign rally hosting an enthusiastic, virtually all-white audience in rural Georgia, President Trump insisted that if Democrats won the state's two Senate runoff elections this week, \"America as you know it will be over, and it will never-I believe-be able to come back again.\"\n\nTrump's speech that night didn't attract as much attention as his incendiary remarks in Washington on Wednesday, which fueled the riot and led to calls for his resignation, removal, or impeachment. Nor did his closing argument in Georgia succeed: The elections there tipped control of the Senate to the Democrats.\n\nRead: Republicans meet their monster\n\nBut Trump's remarks showed how deeply apocalyptic imagery has pervaded Republican electoral strategy. When each election is presented as life-and-death for the country, it may not be surprising that more and more Republican voters and leaders want to maintain power by any means necessary. The claim that any Democratic victory will irrevocably reconfigure the nation taps into a deep fear among key components of the Republican coalition: that they will be eclipsed by the demographic and cultural changes that have made white people-especially white Christians-a steadily shrinking share of the population. When Republicans \"say Democrats are a threat to America, I think they mean to America 1950,\" the veteran Democratic strategist Paul Begala told me. And in the years ahead, that vision of America will only diverge further from reality in a country where kids of color will soon represent a majority of the under-18 population, where a growing number of young people do not identify with any religious tradition, and where white Christians likely slip below 40 percent of the society.\n\nIn polling last fall by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute, a larger share of Republican voters said that white people and Christians face significant discrimination in the United States than said the same about Black people and Latinos. In another national poll conducted earlier last year by the Vanderbilt University political scientist Larry Bartels, just more than half of Republican voters strongly or somewhat agreed with the statement that \"the traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it.\" Fewer than one in six Republicans disagreed. (The rest were unsure.) Foreshadowing Republican voters' embrace of Trump's racist and baseless claims of election fraud in big cities with large Black populations, Bartels also found that three-fourths of Republican voters agreed that \"it is hard to trust the results of elections when so many people will vote for anyone who offers a handout.\"\n\nTrump may be uniquely determined to inflame and weaponize Republicans' willingness to accept (or even welcome) antidemocratic means of maintaining power. But the breadth of anxiety inside the GOP coalition about the fundamental demographic, economic, and cultural changes remaking America strongly suggest that these party tendencies won't disappear when Trump leaves the White House. If anything, they could intensify as those changes accelerate and as the incoming Biden administration-which has given prominent roles to people of color, LGBTQ people, and women-embodies all of them.\n\nAfter all, Trump is not the only prominent elected official to hammer Republican voters with doomsday messaging, including arguments that Democrats want a socialist takeover of the country. \"The choice in this election is whether America remains America,\" Vice President Mike Pence declared at last summer's GOP convention. In an article on the Fox News website just before the Georgia vote, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida declared that Democratic victories would unleash a \"socialist assault on our nation.\"\n\nThat was also the daily drumbeat from David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, the two Republican incumbents who lost this week's Senate races. The two are buttoned-down multimillionaire former corporate executives, who in an earlier era are easy to imagine as standard-issue country-club Republicans who want to cut taxes and regulation. Yet in the runoff elections, each centered their race on the idea that they represented the last line of defense against a unified Democratic government that would allegedly destroy America. Loeffler robotically called her Democratic opponent, Raphael Warnock, a \"radical liberal\" almost each time she mentioned his name in public, and said \"we will lose America\" if he won the election. On Monday night, Trump raised the ante on that argument: \"There is no such thing as a moderate Democrat,\" he said at the Georgia rally, in a distinct echo of the 1950s-era red-baiting politics of his former mentor Roy Cohn. \"This party, this Democrat party is a Marxist socialist party-it's a communist party.\"\n\nSuch language has a long history in the Republican Party. It was especially popular from the 1950s through the early 1960s-particularly among the GOP far right-in the era of Joe McCarthy and the John Birch Society. In a legendary 1950 California Senate race, Richard Nixon famously charged that his Democratic opponent, the representative and former actor Helen Gahagan Douglas, was \"pink right down to her underwear.\" In the early 1960s, Ronald Reagan, then a fading actor transitioning into politics, delivered a speech for the American Medical Association in which he warned that if Democrats passed an early version of Medicare for the elderly, \"one of these days you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children, and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free.\" In Reagan's classic 1964 \"A Time for Choosing\" speech on behalf of the Republican presidential nominee Barry Goldwater, he likewise warned that Democrats were morphing into something akin to \"the labor Socialist Party of England.\"\n\nRead: A Christian insurrection\n\nBut both Nixon and Reagan mostly muted such rhetoric as they moved onto the national stage and as the pitched social conflicts of the 1960s receded. Although they may have harbored those beliefs privately, neither Nixon nor Reagan typically described Democrats in nearly as ominous terms as they did earlier in their career-or as Trump does now. \"Even if, at certain points in their lives, Reagan and Nixon entertained thoughts like that, they wouldn't share it,\" notes the historian and journalist Rick Perlstein, whose four-book series on the modern conservative movement includes volumes on both Nixon and Reagan.\n\nNixon's and Reagan's choice to temper their rhetoric reflected the reality that in the early years of the Republican political revival after 1968, both men still needed to attract voters and navigate around institutions sympathetic to the Democratic Party, which had dominated national politics since Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\n\"In the case of Nixon, that apocalyptic vision was clearly something that lived in his heart,\" Perlstein told me, noting that Nixon expressed it in his once-secret White House tapes . But Nixon was also \"tactically and strategically shrewd.\" He \"prepared obsessively, was extremely concerned about how he came off to the public, and was working in a context in which the dominant political institutions were largely liberal-both the media and largely Congress.\"\n\nThough Reagan was a more ideological figure than Nixon, in the big, signature speeches of his presidency, Reagan talked about Democrats more in sorrow than anger. He sought to attract wavering Democrats by noting that he had once belonged to their party too-before, as he charged, the party evolved away from him. Once Reagan took office, \"he understood that he was the institutional embodiment of this country that had to put a public face forward to the world that was respectable,\" said Perlstein, whose latest volume is titled Reaganland . \"So he understood that he believed things that maybe the public wasn't ready for.\"\n\nBoth George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush often criticized Democratic policies and denounced their opponents as too liberal, but neither routinely portrayed the party as a threat to America's fundamental traditions. Neither did the GOP's presidential nominees in 1996 (Bob Dole), 2008 (John McCain), or 2012 (Mitt Romney).\n\nThe apocalyptic strain of Republican argument never entirely evaporated, though. It persisted in Newt Gingrich's caustic portrayal of Democrats as the enemies of \"normal Americans,\" among conservative grassroots groups (particularly religious conservatives), and within the emerging conservative-media empire, led at first by Rush Limbaugh and other talk-radio hosts in the late 1980s and by Fox News starting about a decade later. In 2010, the Tea Party movement, which erupted after Barack Obama's first two years in office, revived charges of \"socialism\" against Democrats more forcefully than at any point since the 1960s, and merged them with the ongoing anxieties about cultural and demographic change that radiated through the social-conservative movement, talk radio, and Fox. That anxiety crystallized into the birtherism slur (promoted by Trump) against Obama.\n\nLike an invasive plant species, the fevered Tea Party style steadily drove out the more restrained rhetoric deployed by both Bushes, Dole, McCain, and Romney. Trump has completed that transformation with years of messaging that's portrayed his supporters-the virtuous \"real America\"-as under siege from a pincer attack by contemptuous elites above and dangerous minorities and immigrants below determined to steal \"our country.\" Changes in the electoral and media environment have reinforced this shift: Although in the era of Nixon and Reagan, Republicans tried to win voters not entirely in their camp, the party now operates in more of a closed circle. It relies primarily on overtly conservative media to mobilize a more homogeneously conservative electoral base. Those changes have not only allowed, but encouraged, Republicans to vilify Democrats more extravagantly.\n\nApocalyptic rhetoric has \"absorbed all the available oxygen of the Republican ecosystem,\" Perlstein told me.\n\nAdam Serwer: The Capitol riot was an attack on multiracial democracy\n\nDemocrats over the past decade have generally grown tougher in their portrayals of Republicans too, and no shortage of them have described Trump as a racist or a threat to American democracy. But even leaving aside the (considerable) extent to which he's justified those labels, there's still an imbalance: Democratic candidates, with the need to build coalitions that are more diverse both demographically and ideologically than the GOP's, are much more likely to pledge to work with Republicans than to portray the party as endemically extremist. The equivalent to Republicans labeling Democrats as socialists or Marxists would be if the Georgia Senate candidates-much less Biden-described Republicans as authoritarians or fascists. In competitive races, that simply does not happen.\n\nThis week's outrage is not likely to dissuade Republicans from using Flight 93-style arguments, because Trump has changed the party's electoral incentives in a way that pushes many (if not most) GOP candidates toward such inflammatory hyperbole.\n\nTrump's redefinition of the GOP as a vehicle for the white Americans most uneasy about racial and cultural change has alienated many previously Republican-leaning white suburban voters, even in previously Republican-leaning states-as this week's Georgia losses painfully demonstrated to the party again. That means, to win elections, virtually all Republicans now need superheated turnout from the Trump base: white, non-college-educated, nonurban, and evangelical Christian voters. And that means Republicans of all stripes will feel pressure to continue portraying Democrats not merely as misguided or wrong, but as an existential threat to GOP voters' lives-even as Wednesday's riot captures how those alarms are exacerbating the greatest strains on the nation's cohesion since the Civil War."

      "text": "Is Conservatism as We Know It Doomed?\n\nThe movement that William F. Buckley started has mostly made peace with the New Deal. Its members just haven't quite admitted it to themselves yet.\n\nIs conservatism as we know it on the path to extinction?\n\nJonathan Chait thinks so . \"I believe this because the virulent opposition to the welfare state we see here is almost completely unique among major conservative parties across the world,\" he explains. \"In no other advanced country do leading figures of governing parties propose the denial of medical care to their citizens or take their ideological inspiration from crackpots like Ayn Rand. America's unique brand of ideological anti-statism is historically inseparable (as I recently argued ) from the legacy of slavery. Whatever form America's polyglot majority ultimately takes, it is hard to see the basis for its attraction to an ideology sociologically rooted in white supremacy.\"\n\nThere is a nugget of truth here. There's no future for the \"Mister, we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again\" wing of the conservative movement. When the last American to have lived through the New Deal dies, I doubt any significant constituency will still dispute its legitimacy, nor do I think there's a future for the notion that it's illegitimate for the federal government to test prescription drugs or enact environmental rules. The aspect of anti-statism most inextricably tied to white supremacy-the notion that it's inappropriate for the federal government to pass and enforce laws that protect the civil rights-is thankfully going to die as well.\n\nI'm confident in these predictions about the future in part because I think that the right and left alike are fooling themselves about the degree of support, in movement conservatism today, for ideological anti-statism, Randian utopianism, or the notion that medical care should just be denied to sick citizens.\n\nThere is widespread cognitive dissonance on the right when it comes to social welfare and redistribution of wealth generally.\n\nConservatives are partly to blame for this confusion. Consider talk-radio entertainer Mark Levin, a favorite of many movement conservatives. If you accept the argument in his bestselling book, Liberty and Tyranny , it's hard to avoid the conclusion that Social Security and Medicare are unconstitutional and that America would be better with FDR's legacy undone.\n\nBut if you listen to Levin's radio show, you won't hear him agitating for the repeal of those programs or vilifying everyone who supports them as rotten statists. He understands that his audience of relatively wealthy, relatively older, mostly white conservatives don't want to end those social-welfare programs. They want to continue benefitting from them.\n\nThere is widespread cognitive dissonance on the right when it comes to social welfare, a social safety net, and the redistribution of wealth generally. Self-described conservatives often articulate their first principles as if they oppose all welfare spending. But they don't actually think food stamps or welfare checks for impoverished families should be eliminated, which helps explain why redistributive social-welfare spending exists in red states as well as blue states, in red counties as well as blue counties, across Republican as well as Democratic majorities.\n\nConservatives talk tough. They're convinced the system has a lot of waste and fraud. The idea of freeloading hucksters on welfare outrages them to a degree far out of proportion to other government waste, sometimes for discreditable reasons. They're not all talk on welfare cuts, but their bark is worse than their bite.\n\nThis is most obvious when one examines the candidates behind whom the conservative movement rallies and what happens when they actually win elections. No one who reads Ayn Rand carefully could mistake the world she hoped to create for any program by any Republican president or congressional majority. The height of movement conservatism under Reagan did not even begin to undo the New Deal. President George W. Bush expanded social welfare in the healthcare system. Neither John McCain nor Mitt Romney, the conservative alternative to McCain in 2008, can be mistaken for ideological anti-statists.\n\nRomney either embodied or understood this cognitive dissonance better than most. He did his best to bring universal health insurance to Massachusetts, bragged about all the people he helped, and then, some years later, told donors that his opponent's supporters were just takers who vote blue for the social-welfare bribes. Remember how during the 2008 and 2012 GOP primaries, Romney reinvented himself at every opportunity even as he insisted he'd been the same guy all along? That was the cognitive dissonance in conservatism personified.\n\nMost movement conservatives would be loath to eliminate social welfare spending. No elected Republican has tried to do it in memory, and none ever will. Conservatives seldom rally around actual anti-statists. Yet they are loath to admit, even to themselves, that they favor some degree of redistribution of wealth.\n\nWhat's silly is suffering a portion of that hit for the ability to pretend you'd return to a pre-New Deal America if you could. Lots of conservatives do that.\n\nIt's as if they're afraid that if they admit it's legitimate for Uncle Sam to redistribute a portion of their income, they'll have no way to object if he comes for all of it. Ironically, free-market icons like Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek were much more comfortable endorsing the legitimacy of a social safety net. And they were no less able to defend the market and private property!\n\nIf rank-and-file conservatives actually believed that social-welfare spending ought to be eliminated (or much more far-fetched, that the next Congress ought to implement an Objectivist policy platform), it might make sense to suffer the consequences of holding positions that are very unpopular with the electorate. What's silly is suffering a portion of that hit for the ability to pretend you'd return to a pre-New Deal America if you could. Lots of conservatives do that.\n\nWith all that in mind, let's return to Chait's characterization:\n\nI believe this because the virulent opposition to the welfare state we see here is almost completely unique among major conservative parties across the world. In no other advanced country do leading figures of governing parties propose the denial of medical care to their citizens or take their ideological inspiration from crackpots like Ayn Rand. America's unique brand of ideological anti-statism is historically inseparable from the legacy of slavery. Whatever form America's polyglot majority ultimately takes, it is hard to see the basis for its attraction to an ideology sociologically rooted in white supremacy.\n\nIt's true, conservatives will never again elect a president, or even a nominee, who virulently opposes the welfare state, advocates denying medical care to citizens, aspires to implement Randian philosophy, and harbors anti-statism inseparable from slavery. Of course, it isn't clear that the conservative movement ever did elect anyone like that. Instead it elected Ronald Reagan, George H.W Bush, and George W. Bush, and tried to elect Bob Dole, John McCain, and Mitt Romney.\n\nOne day, movement conservatives will admit that they think there should be a safety net and no Cuban embargo. On that day, they'll already have felt that way secretly for years."

      "text": "The Sci-Fi Story That Offends Oversensitive White Conservatives\n\nThe right's latest bogeyman, Derrick Bell, once pondered what would happen if aliens offered gold in exchange for America's black people .\n\nAmericans decided in 2008 that Barack Obama wasn't a radical black leftist, despite attempts by some conservatives to exploit his relationship with Jeremiah Wright and contact with Bill Ayers. Predictably, President Obama has not governed as a radical black leftist, or adopted the controversial rhetoric of a fiery preacher, or embraced the tactics of the Weather Underground. There is nevertheless another conservative attempt to persuade Americans that he's hiding something.\n\nThe evidence? A couple decades ago, Obama hugged the late law professor Derrick Bell after introducing him during a rally at Harvard Law School. You can read about Professor Bell here . Spoiler alert: there's no shame in having hugged him. True to its genre, the controversy is a big nothing-burger. But it has renewed interest in a provocative short story that Professor Bell published in 1992. Perhaps the easiest way to characterize it is \"critical race theory meets sci-fi.\" It begins as alien ships unexpectedly arrive on earth. The aliens have a proposition for the United States.\n\nTheir offer:\n\nHad white Americans swiftly repudiated the alien offer due to their basic decency and lack of racism, the story wouldn't be controversial, so I trust I am not spoiling anything by revealing that isn't how things go in the piece. Bell has a rather dark view of human nature -- see The Lottery for another dark exploration of a similar theme -- and can you blame him? He was born in 1930 and spent his early career helping to desegregate swimming pools and schools over the objections of racists who wanted to keep them segregated. And he was later forced to resign from the Justice Department for the transgression of refusing to give up his NAACP membership.\n\nI don't really understand what the conservatives who conclude from this story that he is a racist are talking about. In fact, he seemed to think, circa 1992, that a majority of whites still harbored complicated but ultimately racist attitudes toward blacks. If the aliens came to America today, their ships loaded with gold, I don't think America would agree to sell them its black residents if it went to majority vote. I am less certain how a referendum on Muslims would go. America would certainly have sold aliens citizens of Japanese ancestry in 1941. And also Native Americans at various points throughout our history.\n\nThose objecting to \"The Space Traders\" would do well to acknowledge that for many decades of American history, including years during Professor Bell's life, a majority of Americans would have voted in favor of trading blacks for fantastic wealth, unlimited energy, and an end to pollutants. I wonder, if God could run the hypotheticals for us, and Americans were forced to wager $1,000 of their own money, what year they'd choose as the first when blacks would win the referendum. I'd be curious for an answer from Diane Ellis, who seems to think that the story is deplorable and evidence of Bell's alleged racism. I'd say it's evidence that his experiences made him understandably pessimistic about how racial majorities will treat racial minorities given the right circumstances. To label someone as a racist for honesty conveying his dark view of human nature is the sort of politically correct, reductive stifling of speech that conservatives are supposed to stand against.\n\nFlickr user MJTMail"

      "text": "How to Stop the Minority-Rule Doom Loop\n\nThe next two years might be America's last chance to protect the basic democratic principle of majority rule.\n\nP resident Joe Biden came into office facing four \"converging crises\" : COVID-19, climate change, racial justice, and the economy. But after a few weeks of fast action on a pandemic relief plan, a fifth crisis will determine the fate of the rest of his administration, and perhaps that of American democracy itself: the minority-rule doom loop, by which predominantly white conservatives gain more and more power, even as they represent fewer Americans.\n\nThe doom loop consists of four interlocking components. Candidates who represent white conservatives-Republicans, in our ideologically sorted era-begin every election cycle buoyed by a sluice of voter suppression and gerrymandering (what I call electoral welfare), which makes it easier for them to win. Then antidemocratic features of the American system that have always existed but never benefited one party over the other in any systematic way help those same candidates take control of institutions such as the White House and the Senate, despite winning fewer votes and representing fewer people than their opponents. Once in control of these institutions, these newly elected officials use them to entrench their power beyond the reach of voters. If they are eventually voted out of power, they retain a veto over the agenda of the majority, which they use to block change and feed the conservative case that the government is \"broken.\" This hastens their return to power-along the very path they greased with voter suppression.\n\nThe net effect of this doom loop is a growing divergence between the agenda of the government and the will of the governed, an untenable dynamic in any democracy. With Democratic control of Congress hanging by a handful of seats, the next two years might be the country's last chance to stop this cycle.\n\nKenneth Owen: Minority rule cannot last in America\n\nThe loop starts at the ballot box, where Republicans are making it harder than at any time in recent history for those who are unlikely to vote for them to vote at all. According to Michael McDonald, a professor at the University of Florida and one of the nation's foremost experts on voting laws, \"We are witnessing the greatest rollback of voting rights in this country since the Jim Crow era.\" The Supreme Court's 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder unleashed a new wave of voter suppression targeted at reliably Democratic constituencies such as nonwhite voters and young people. The pace of suppression has only increased since the November election. According to the Brennan Center for Justice , which tracks voter-suppression efforts across the country, 47 states have seen 361 bills aimed at restricting voting rights since the beginning of the year.\n\nRepublicans don't just have an easier time winning elections; they have an easier time piecing together individual election wins to gain control of the institutions that govern American life. Here, too, the doom loop gives a big boost to candidates who represent predominantly white conservatives. Over the past half century, demographic shifts have rendered the antidemocratic features of American government newly vulnerable to exploitation, but especially by candidates who represent white conservatives.\n\nThe clearest-and most powerful-demonstration of this is the role of the Electoral College in American politics. Throughout the 20th century, the antidemocratic potential of the Electoral College remained dormant. After 1888 until 2000, every president who won the White House won both the popular vote and the Electoral College. Even when the popular vote was close, the Electoral College only accentuated the margin of the victor. In 1960, it augmented John F. Kennedy's narrow popular victory with a 303-219 Electoral College win. Eight years later, it converted Richard Nixon's .7 percent popular-vote win over Hubert Humphrey into a 301-191 electoral-vote victory. A swing of thousands of votes in either election could have caused the popular vote and Electoral College results to diverge. But it didn't happen, and so for the entire 20th century, America never had to contend with a president who had won fewer votes than his opponent.\n\nIndeed, the fear that the Electoral College could have produced an antidemocratic result in 1968 inspired a bipartisan and nearly successful effort to eliminate it. As the journalist Jesse Wegman documents in his book, Let the People Pick the President , the strong showing of Alabama Governor George Wallace, who ran as an independent, came close to denying Nixon an Electoral College victory, which would have thrown the election to the House and taken it out of the hands of voters. In response, in 1969, an amendment to repeal the Electoral College passed the House 338 to 70. By the time the amendment passed the House, 30 states were already poised to ratify it, with more leaning toward joining them to reach the necessary threshold of 38. In the Senate, the repeal effort came within a few votes of succeeding but was scuttled by a filibuster . Reflecting the consensus at the time, the historian James MacGregor Burns warned that by keeping the college in place, America was playing \"a game of Russian roulette, and one of these days we are going to blow our brains out.\"\n\nHe was right. Today, the antidemocratic force of the Electoral College is the dominant feature of American politics. Since 2000, both Republican presidents who won the White House came to power without winning the popular vote. The consequences of these presidencies for America and the world are hard to overstate.\n\nRepublicans owe their newfound Electoral College advantage to a recent shift in white voters' preferences. As the analyst David Shor has found , that advantage exists \"because white voters without a college degree *in large midwestern states* switched their votes en-masse from Obama to Trump in 2016.\" According to FiveThirtyEight , the effect of this shift is that a Democratic presidential candidate now has to run at least 3.5 percentage points ahead of their Republican opponent in the popular vote to win the White House-the largest advantage either party has held in more than 70 years, and the first time any advantage has helped a party overcome a popular-vote deficit.\n\nRepublicans enjoy the same kind of structural welfare when it comes to the Senate, where they have to win fewer votes than Democrats to control the chamber. Although it was always theoretically possible for a party to control a majority in the Senate despite representing a minority of the population, it did not happen with any frequency in the 20th century. By contrast, in the 21st century, every time Republicans have controlled the Senate, they have represented a minority of the population.\n\nRead: How the minority wins\n\nLike the Electoral College, the antidemocratic nature of the Senate has always existed, but it did not favor one party over the other in any systematic way until recently. The decision to award each state the same number of senators regardless of population was one of the most controversial of the Constitutional Convention, where James Madison decried it as a source of \"injustice.\" Back then, the largest state by population, Virginia, was about 10 times more populous than the smallest state, Delaware. Today, the most populous state, California, is roughly 70 times larger than the smallest state, Wyoming, rendering the injustice Madison condemned exponentially worse.\n\nAs with the Electoral College, Republicans owe their ability to wield minority rule in the Senate to white voters. Democrats and Republicans used to win Senate seats in big and small states at comparable rates because both parties used to be competitive with white working-class voters. But since the 1960s, the shift of these voters toward the GOP has turned the Senate's overrepresentation of rural areas into an entrenched Republican advantage. As the political scientist Lee Drutman has found , where there was once little correlation between the size of a state's population and the party that represented it, \"there is now a clear and pronounced partisan small-state bias in the Senate thanks to mostly rural, less populated states voting increasingly Republican.\" Such states are, of course, overwhelmingly white. A 2018 analysis by Civis Analytics found that nonwhite voters are more underrepresented in the Senate than at any time since 1870. In today's Senate, evenly split at 50 seats a party, that bias toward predominantly white, small states means that Democrats represent 41 million more people than Republicans.\n\nAs white conservatives shrink into a minority bloc, the doom loop provides them a pathway to gain power anyway. Once in power, they use it to accelerate the loop.\n\nControl of the White House and Senate allows Republicans who came to power on the backs of a white, conservative minority to appoint judges who make it even easier for Republicans to win elections. Although conservative and liberal justices sided against former President Donald Trump's outlandish claims of election fraud, conservative judges are waging a steady, if quieter, campaign against voting rights. A recent study shows that 79 percent of decisions by Republican-appointed judges restrict access to the ballot, versus 37 percent for Democratic-appointed judges. This has proved true at the Supreme Court, where Chief Justice John Roberts authored the majority opinion in the Shelby case, gutting the 1965 Voting Rights Act and capping off the career-long crusade against voting rights that he began as a political appointee in the Reagan Justice Department. Overall, judges appointed by Bush and Trump make up 48 percent of the judiciary. Judges appointed by Trump alone make up 28 percent. When these judges hear antidemocratic claims that are less absurd than Trump's, they are likely to be sympathetic.\n\nGerrymandering at the state level also plays a crucial role in the doom loop, allowing Republicans to maintain control of state legislatures, which then pass restrictive voting laws in key swing states and inflate Republicans' numbers in Congress, despite representing a minority of the populations in those states. A bipartisan panel of judges found that in North Carolina's 2018 midterm elections, Democratic candidates for the state legislature won a majority of the statewide vote, but Republicans won 54 percent of state House seats and 58 percent of state Senate seats. A University of Southern California study found that Michigan, Wisconsin, Virginia, Ohio, and Pennsylvania all suffer from minority rule in one or both chambers of their state legislatures. These state legislatures draw the congressional-district maps every 10 years, and will do so in the coming months, following the results of the 2020 census. As Dave Wasserman of The Cook Political Report has shown , Republicans can use this upcoming round of redistricting to gerrymander away Democrats' majority in the House of Representatives before a single vote is cast in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nThe loop makes it harder and harder for Democrats to win elections, despite representing more and more people. But when Democrats do fight that uphill battle and win, the last leg of the loop lets politicians who represent white conservatives wield a veto over the majority's agenda. These representatives use any means available to them to manufacture gridlock and sow discontent among voters-which, in addition to frustrating any possibility of a strong governmental response to the various crises America is dealing with, feeds the conservative case that the government is broken and helps them regain power. This effort largely takes place in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThe Senate was designed to give minority factions a voice, but senators committed to maintaining white supremacy expanded the limited minority protections designed by the Framers into full-bore veto power. Even Madison, who went out of his way to design protections for minority factions, believed that after the minority had its say, issues should be decided by majority-rule votes. In \" Federalist No. 10 ,\" often cited by conservatives for Madison's eloquent defense of minority rights, he makes clear that the principle of majority rule superseded the minority's right to block and delay. \"If a faction consists of less than a majority,\" Madison wrote, \"relief is supplied by the republican principle, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote.\"\n\nIndeed, the Senate functioned as a majority-rule institution for the first 200 years of its existence. In 1964, for instance, President Lyndon B. Johnson was informed by an aide that he was certain Medicare would pass because his whip count pegged support at 55 votes, enough to pass. In today's Senate, that would mean certain failure.\n\nThe major exception to the practice of majority rule in the Senate was civil rights, and the driving force behind the rise of the minority veto was white supremacy. The visionary of the minority veto was Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, a champion of the slaveholders and spiritual father of the Confederacy. Starting in the 1830s, Calhoun recognized that majority rule would lead to the steady elimination of slavery, and sought to expand the power of the minority on behalf of the slaveholding faction he represented. Calhoun was explicit about his goal to strengthen Madison's minority protections into an outright veto. In his Disquisition on Government , Calhoun complained that Madison's system offered insufficient protections to minority factions, and explained that his own goal was \"to give to each portion or interest of the community a negative on the others.\"\n\nThe best Calhoun could do against a Senate where rules and norms still firmly entrenched majority rule was to innovate what we would recognize today as the \"talking\" filibuster. Although this early iteration was strong enough to delay bills for as long as its practitioners could hold the floor, it was almost never powerful enough to block them altogether. Still, it was a radical innovation at the time. When Calhoun launched into his early filibusters, cloaking himself in the mantle of minority rights and shocking contemporary observers, the Senate was still governed by the ethic laid out in the manual of congressional procedure Thomas Jefferson had written, which dictated that \"no one is to speak impertinently or beside the question, superfluous, or tediously.\"\n\nDavid Litt: We already got rid of the filibuster once before\n\nCalhoun's dream of an outright minority veto would begin to emerge in the Jim Crow era. Once again, southern white supremacists found themselves facing a majority determined to make progress on civil rights. In the early decades of the 20th century, federal anti-lynching and anti-poll-tax bills repeatedly mustered majority support in the House and Senate, and enjoyed the backing of presidents of both parties; one anti-poll-tax bill appeared to have the votes to pass into law as early as 1891. The American public was ready for action too. When the polling firm Gallup first surveyed Americans about federal anti-lynching laws in 1937, it found 72 percent of the public to be in support, including a majority in the South. On anti-poll-tax laws, Gallup found more than 60 percent support as early as the 1940s.\n\nTo block the majority's desire for action on civil rights, the white-supremacist senators of the South repurposed a 1917 rule intended to end filibusters and used it to extend them indefinitely, thus killing bills altogether. Declaring that the real issue was not civil rights but minority protections, they turned this new procedural vote to end debate (or invoke \"cloture\") into the de facto vote on a bill itself. Because the rule set the cloture vote at a supermajority threshold while the vote to pass bills remained at a majority, a minority could win the vote on cloture, but not the vote on passage.\n\nPuffing themselves up to lofty rhetorical heights, southern senators turned this new cloture vote into the decisive vote for civil-rights bills, and only civil-rights bills. \"Free speech and the Constitution of the United States won a memorable victory,\" Senator Tom Connally of Texas boasted in 1942, celebrating the use of cloture to defeat a bill to end poll taxes. At the time, Texas still had poll taxes, but Connally dismissed them as a \"mere incident.\" On issues other than civil rights, southern senators routinely voted to end debate. Somehow, free speech seemed to become an issue strictly when civil-rights legislation was at stake.\n\nAlthough this procedural switcheroo was consistently applied to civil rights only through the 1960s, in the second half of the century, it began to be used for other issues. That change came gradually at first, maybe a few times per two-year session of the Senate, and then began to accelerate during the end of the 20th century and into the 21st, before exploding into the hundreds under Senator Mitch McConnell.\n\nWhen McConnell became minority leader in 2007, the number of measures forced to clear the supermajority hurdle of cloture doubled over the previous session and continued rising. By 2013, half of all the filibusters ever waged against presidential nominees in the Senate's history had been directed by McConnell against President Barack Obama. Under McConnell's leadership, it became routine for every piece of business before the Senate to require 60 votes to pass.\n\nThere was never an affirmative decision that the Senate should require a supermajority of 60 votes for passage instead of a majority. It just kind of happened, the product of decades of acquiescence in the face of determined obstructionists. Of course, the flip side of requiring a supermajority on all legislation is that a minority can block whatever it wants. In the modern Senate, Calhoun's minority veto has effectively transpired.\n\nAs the use of the modern filibuster and its 60-vote threshold expanded, both parties took advantage of it when it served their interests. (As a senior aide to the Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, I defended many Democratic filibusters after Republicans took the majority in 2014.) But although the filibuster occasionally comes in handy for progressives, it has always benefited conservatives far more, and still does today. Obstruction has a partisan lean to the right-it is more useful to conservatives, who, in William F. Buckley's famous phrase describing his magazine, National Review , are the constituency that \"stands athwart history, yelling Stop.\" By contrast, progressives primarily advance their agenda by passing major legislation. A 2019 study by the Center for American Progress shows that Republicans have used the filibuster to block Democratic legislation roughly twice as often as Democrats have used it to block Republican bills.\n\nOne aspect that might have exceeded even Calhoun's wildest dreams is the ease with which the modern filibuster and its attendant minority veto can be wielded. Today, no one is required to debate on the Senate floor. In 2013, Republicans filibustered a bill to create universal background checks proposed by Senators Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey following the Newtown massacre. The bill secured the support of a bipartisan majority of 55 senators. During the week the bill was on the floor, its opponents largely declined to debate it. Senator McConnell, leading the opposition, spoke about the bill for a grand total of two minutes. That same week, McConnell found more time to celebrate the legacy of Margaret Thatcher and the March Madness victory of the University of Louisville men's basketball team than he did to discuss background checks.\n\nIn Calhoun's time, opponents would have had to hold the Senate floor in order to block a measure like the background-checks bill from receiving a majority-threshold vote. They would have been forced to endure the public's ire for opposing a bill backed by 88 percent of the American people, as a poll showed at the time. But in the modern Senate, no one was required to explain themselves. At best, the public had a hazy idea of why the bill failed. It wasn't voted down, exactly. Rather, it failed to secure 60 votes to clear a once-obscure procedural hurdle and died. Calhoun's minority veto was wielded quietly, but with tremendous force.\n\nAbout a year and a half after Republicans defeated the Manchin-Toomey bill, they regained the Senate majority, thanks in no small part to voter frustration with \"Washington gridlock.\" The 54 seats Republicans won in 2014 represented 46 percent of the American population. Republicans used that control to block most of the remainder of President Obama's agenda and, most consequentially, his appointment of Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. When Trump won the White House, he filled the seat with Neil Gorsuch, later adding Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett alongside him. Today, they make up half of a six-seat conservative majority poised to strike down much of Biden's agenda, while McConnell wields Calhoun's veto in the Senate. Together, these forces can impede desperately needed change, depress the Democratic base-and with help from voter suppression and gerrymandering, return Republicans to majorities in the House and the Senate in the 2022 midterm elections, permanently crippling Biden's presidency.\n\nOn and on, the doom loop spins.\n\nB reaking the loop is possible, but only if Biden treats it as a crisis. \"It's getting to the point where, you know, democracy is having a hard time functioning,\" he observed to George Stephanopoulos last month. Indeed, the question of whether our democracy can perform its most basic function of reflecting the will of all its people, or whether it becomes a force wielded by a white minority to overrule our diverse majority, will be decided on Biden's watch. If he fails, the window of opportunity will slam shut and may not reopen.\n\nDavid Frum: The Founders were wrong about democracy\n\nBreaking the doom loop starts with ending or at least eroding Republicans' electoral welfare through a robust democracy agenda. Although the House has passed H.R. 1, the Senate must do the same, and both chambers must follow that up by passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, as well as additional democracy reforms such as Representative Jamie Raskin's Ranked Choice Voting Act.\n\nDemocrats must reform the courts, which are undergoing a crisis of legitimacy. As Quinta Jurecic and Susan Hennessey recently wrote , \"The Court has come to more closely represent the interests of a powerful minority,\" a fact underscored by the looming threat that Roberts might reiterate his Shelby decision by striking down new voting-rights laws. Biden's commission is a good place to start, but its recommendations must be aggressive and congressional Democrats must see them through.\n\nFinally, Democrats must fix the Senate. This means rectifying the representational imbalances that enable Republicans to more easily control the Senate. Wyoming, a predominantly white state of about 600,000 people, is represented by two senators, while the similarly sized District of Columbia-where a plurality of the population is Black-is represented by zero senators. Granting D.C. statehood won't solve the Senate's underrepresentation of nonwhite Americans, but it will be a step in the right direction. Puerto Rico, whose population is larger than more than 20 states, certainly deserves to become a state as well.\n\nThe gateway to all of these reforms is eliminating or dramatically reforming the filibuster. Simply put, none of the other reforms will pass if Democrats leave the filibuster intact.\n\nFilibuster reform should aim at keeping what is good about the Senate, including the minority's right to be heard and have a voice in the process, while restoring what has been lost: the ability to move forward with the nation's business in a reasonably timely fashion, by majority vote if necessary.\n\nIf Biden and congressional Democrats enact these reforms, they will start to break the doom loop. Calhoun would be appalled. But Madison, whose respect for minority rights never obscured his higher loyalty to the \"republican principle\" of majority rule, would approve.\n\nThis story is part of the project \" The Battle for the Constitution ,\" in partnership with the National Constitution Center ."

      "text": "Don't Read This If You Were a Rush Limbaugh Fan\n\nThe talk-radio host, who died this week, hurt the conservative movement.\n\nUpdated at 12:07 p.m. ET on February 19, 2021.\n\nAs a radio broadcaster, Rush Limbaugh, who died yesterday, was a great success: He pioneered his genre, attracted millions of listeners for several decades, and grew fantastically wealthy. Many good people were used to his daily company, something unimaginable to critics who heard only the most odious excerpts from his broadcasts, never the more typical segments. If you're a Limbaugh fan who feels like you've lost a friend, my condolences, and best to stop reading here.\n\nAs a proponent of conservatism in America, Limbaugh was a failure who in his later years abandoned the project of advancing a positive agenda, culminating in his alignment with the vulgar style and populist anti-leftism of Donald Trump. Character no longer mattered. Budget deficits no longer mattered. Free trade no longer mattered. Nepotism no longer mattered. Lavishing praise on foreign dictators no longer mattered.\n\nAll that mattered was owning the libs in the culture war, in part to avenge a deeply felt sense of aggrievement. Limbaugh and Trump were alike in attaining great wealth and political influence while still talking and seeming to feel as though society was stacked against guys like them.\n\nFrom the April 2005 issue: Host\n\nIn obituaries and commemorations, many right-leaning commentators are crediting Limbaugh with advancing movement conservatism, as if he were the William F. Buckley Jr. of the Baby Boomer generation. That's certainly how it felt in the 1990s when I would hear him in the car with my grandparents. Back then, before Fox News, no one on the right was as popular with the public.\n\nYet he wasn't for everyone with conservative instincts , and the proposition that Limbaugh helped conservatism thrive or grow is unsubstantiated. National Review and Barry Goldwater reinvigorated conservatism in postwar America. The high-water mark of American conservatism, Ronald Reagan's presidency, was over before Limbaugh was a force in American politics.\n\nOver the ensuing decades, as Limbaugh grew in fame and gained as much influence in the Republican Party as anyone, the conservative movement suffered from political and intellectual decline. \"In place of the permanent things, we get Happy Meal conservatism: cheap, childish, familiar,\" a writer at The American Conservative once complained . \"Gone are the internal tensions, the thought-provoking paradoxes, the ideological uneasiness that marked the early Right.\" The seesaw of partisan politics gave conservatives occasional victories, such as the 1994 Republican takeover of the House and the 2010 Tea Party wave, but once in office the GOP tended to squander those victories quickly and never accomplished much conservative change. The government kept getting bigger. The country kept getting more socially liberal. The right delighted in the fact that the left was never able to create its own Rush Limbaugh, despite various attempts . But perhaps that supposed failing has helped progressives make gains.\n\nSince Limbaugh's political radio career took off in the late 1980s, each successive Republican president has been less conservative than the last, and Trump was the least conservative GOP president since Richard Nixon. Looking at that trajectory and thinking that Limbaugh helped advance conservatism in America is as delusional as believing Jeb Bush's claim that his brother kept Americans safe on 9/11.\n\nIn 2006, after Republicans lost the House in midterm elections, Limbaugh admitted that he'd long been \"carrying water\" for GOP elected officials even though he didn't believe they deserved it. Over time, as the talk-radio style of culture-war point scoring over a substantive agenda, and loyalty over intellectual honesty, became more common among GOP politicos as well as right-leaning entertainers, the coalition got less and less conservative, culminating in the GOP's takeover by populists who openly championed tariffs and other barriers to the free trade of goods.\n\n\"This is called the Republican Party,\" Trump emphasized during his 2016 campaign. \"It's not called the Conservative Party.\" Or as Limbaugh himself put it on his show that same year, \"Can somebody point to me the conservative on the ballot? What do you mean, Rush? Are you admitting Trump is not a conservative? Damn right I am! Folks, when did I ever say that he was? Look, I don't know how to tell you this. Conservatism lost in the primary, if that's how you want to look at it.\"\n\nBrian Rosenwald: They just wanted to entertain\n\nLimbaugh isn't solely or mostly responsible for conservatism's decline, but he is partly responsible. He spent several decades running interference for whoever was leading the Republican Party, only to complain later that those same Republicans were corrupt swamp creatures. Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Newt Gingrich, George W. Bush, Sarah Palin, Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, and Trump differed greatly in their worldviews and policy agendas, but Limbaugh, always more a partisan warrior than an intellectual leader with independent convictions, aligned with each just at the height of his or her power in the GOP, even in years when fiscal profligacy under Republican leadership meant ballooning budget deficits and debt. Nor is fiscal conservatism the only core belief Limbaugh jettisoned.\n\nIn the 1990s, no one spent more time than Limbaugh insisting on the importance of character in a president. \"This, ultimately, is why the issue of character is so important,\" he wrote in his 1992 best seller, The Way Things Ought to Be . \"Liberals wig out when character becomes an issue, because many of their candidates are of dubious character.\" In the aughts, no one spent more time deflecting Democratic attacks against President George W. Bush's foreign policy. But when Trump, a former Democrat and serial adulterer who lied constantly, became a Republican and ran for president characterizing Bush's foreign policy as an unmitigated disaster, Limbaugh got on board as people with deeper commitments to conservatism went Never Trump. While never a RINO, he became a conservative in name only.\n\nFor Limbaugh, most standards mattered only as long as they were useful weapons in a given moment. \"Without question there is a rising clamor for change, not only in our political institutions and establishment, but in the policies and directions which emanate from them,\" Limbaugh wrote in 1992, when he was aligned with the establishment Bush family against the insurgent Ross Perot. \"The key to change, though, will be found inside, not outside the system among politically experienced people who are ethical, honest, and moral-characteristics that do matter, despite how loudly they are pooh-poohed by the liberal elite. Outsiders, and those who present themselves as such, will ultimately end up as carcasses strewn across the countryside, false prophets of a false premise.\" When aligning with Trump, he contravened all those ideas.\n\nLimbaugh's shiftiness applied beyond partisan politics to the culture war, in which he took glee in skewering what he saw as frivolous accusations of racism perpetrated by frequent foils such as Al Sharpton, even as the perennially color-conscious talk-radio host established himself as a race-baiter as promiscuous as any. Hired as an NFL commentator in 2003, Limbaugh immediately fixated on the race of a Black quarterback. In 2009, I wrote about how often he accused others of racism: *\n\nHarvard Professor Henry Louis Gates? \"He's a racist,\" Mr. Limbaugh said. \"He's an angry racist.\" Sonja Sotomayor? \"She's a bigot. She's a racist,\" Mr. Limbaugh said. \"How can a president nominate such a candidate? And how can a party get behind such a candidate? That's what would be asked if somebody were foolish enough to nominate David Duke or pick somebody even less offensive.\" President Obama? He's \"the biggest reverse racist in history.\"\n\nDemocrats generally? \"The racism that everybody thinks exists on our side of the aisle has been on full display throughout their primary campaign.\" Liberals? \"You know, racism in this country is the exclusive province of the left.\" The media? \"We're witnessing racism all this week that led up to the inauguration. We're being told that we have to hope he succeeds. That we have to bend over, grab the ankles, bend over forward, backward, whichever, because his father's black, because this is the first black president.\"\n\nMinorities generally?\n\n\"The days of them not having any power are over, and they are angry. And they want to use their power as a means of retribution. That's what Obama's about, gang. He's angry, he's gonna cut this country down to size, he's gonna make it pay for all the multicultural mistakes that it has made, it's mistreatment of minorities. I know exactly what's going on.\"\n\nIn one particularly odious example of fueling divisive racial paranoia, Limbaugh told his audience, \"It's Obama's America, is it not? Obama's America, white kids getting beat up on school buses now. You put your kids on a school bus, you expect safety but in Obama's America the white kids now get beat up with the black kids cheering, 'Yay, right on, right on, right on, right on,' and, of course, everybody says the white kid deserved it, he was born a racist, he's white.\"\n\nRemarks like that alienated principled conservatives such as Rod Dreher, who said at the time, \"Good grief, Limbaugh is up to something wicked. He's plainly trying to rally white conservatives into thinking that now that we have a Black president, Blacks are rising up to attack white kids! Christ have mercy, what is wrong with these people? I won't have anything to do with it, not even tangentially.\"\n\nFor my entire life, Limbaugh, as much as any leftist, was a hypocritical force for identity politics. More than that, he personified bigotry. Bull Connor and Lee Atwater were gone, George W. Bush was reaching out to Latino voters, but Limbaugh could still be relied upon to question Obama's place of birth or call Sandra Fluke a slut.\n\nIn the end, Limbaugh was aligned with a Republican standard-bearer who openly bashed Mexicans and Muslims to win the White House. Trump lost the popular vote twice and served one term, accomplishing the confirmation of many conservative judges but little else of lasting consequence for conservatives. By the end of Trump's time in office, conservative self-identification was falling overall.\n\nMany on the right will still feel like Limbaugh did a lot for conservatism, but facts don't care about feelings. William F. Buckley Jr. advanced conservatism. Milton Friedman advanced conservatism. Limbaugh advanced the smug hatred of liberals and feminists, took pleasure in mocking the left, fueled the ugliest impulses of his audience more often than he sought to elevate national discourse, boosted Republican politicians (whatever their policy preferences) until the end, and died an identitarian populist who betrayed the philosophy he long extolled. He will likely be remembered more for the worst things he said than the best things he said, because unlike Buckley, who said his share of awful things, no Limbaugh quote stands out as especially witty or brilliant. Given his talents as a broadcaster, his shortcomings were a tragedy. At least he gave generously to charity.\n\nMay he rest in peace.\n\n* A previous version of this article misstated the year that Limbaugh was hired as an NFL commentator. It was 2003, not 2009."

      "text": "This Time It's Different: The Conservative Response to Ferguson\n\nThe politics of crime has changed since the 1990s. Can Rand Paul help his party embrace the new reality?\n\nA dead black teenager, an enraged black community, an aggressive and ham-handed mostly white police force: The standoff in Ferguson, Missouri, is depressingly familiar. What's not is the way conservatives have reacted.\n\nFor decades, from George Wallace to Richard Nixon to Ronald Reagan to Rudy Giuliani, conservative pols have responded to conflicts like Ferguson in the same way: support the cops, paint your liberal opponents as soft on black crime, and reap a vast harvest of white working-class votes. Forty, 30, 20, or even 10 years ago, the idea that a leading Republican presidential candidate would react to a violent confrontation between police and black demonstrators by insisting that \"we must demilitarize the police\" and bemoaning the fact that \"our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences\" would have been inconceivable.\n\nIn explaining Senator Rand Paul's response to Ferguson-and the growing skepticism of tough-on-crime policies among leading Republican politicians today-commentators often cite the libertarian attitudes of younger voters and the GOP's desperate need to change its image among African Americans and Latinos. But reaching out to these constituencies by shifting GOP policies on crime would be impossible if it produced the kind of furious backlash among conservative activists that Republican politicians have endured for trying to change their party's policies on immigration.\n\nWhy can Paul get away with it? Because of one of the most fundamental, and underappreciated, shifts in the American political landscape: the decline of crime. From the late 1960s, when violent crime began to rise, through the mid 1990s, when it began to fall , crime was among the most potent issues in American politics, and a key factor in pushing political discourse to the right.\n\nIn 1968, Richard Nixon ran an ad consisting solely of a middle-aged white woman walking alone a dark and deserted street as the narrator declared, \"Crimes of violence in the United States have almost doubled in recent years. Today a violent crime is committed every sixty seconds.\"\n\nIn 1988, Republicans made Michael Dukakis's furlough program for state inmates-and the image of convicted murderer Willie Horton, a black man who did not return from a furlough and committed rape and armed robbery-a key element of their assault on the Massachusetts governor.* During that year's debates, CNN's Bernard Shaw asked Dukakis whether he'd want the death penalty for a man who raped and murdered his wife. (The question is virtually inconceivable today.) When Dukakis gave an unemotional and statistics-laden answer , some pundits declared his candidacy over.\n\nWhen Bill Clinton ran four years later, he was so determined to avoid Dukakis' fate that in late January 1992, with the Iowa caucuses only days away, he flew back to Arkansas to preside over the execution of Ricky Ray Rector, a man so mentally impaired that during his last meal he asked guards to save his pecan pie for \"later.\" Upon becoming president, Clinton signed a crime bill that rescinded the right of inmates to receive Pell Grants for university education, created \"boot camps\" for delinquent minors, allocated large sums for new prisons, and made 60 new offenses eligible for the death penalty.\n\nBut in the two decades since, violent crime has dropped and dropped. As a result, public attitudes have softened. The percentage of Americans who favor the death penalty for murderers, which hit 80 percent in 1994, fell to 60 percent last year. Even more importantly, crime has virtually disappeared as a political issue. In 1994, according to the University of Albany , 37 percent of Americans cited crime or violence as the \"most important problem facing the country.\" By 2012, it was 2 percent.\n\nIt's not that many of the white conservatives who once voted Republican because of their fear of crime no longer harbor racialized fears about illegality and public disorder. They still do. But to a large degree, those fears have shifted from black crime to Latino immigration. And this shift has given Paul and other Republicans the space to challenge harsh police tactics and sentencing policies without incurring the wrath of their party base.\n\nIn intriguing ways, Rand Paul in 2014 is the mirror image of Bill Clinton in 1992. Clinton won white votes by confronting their stereotype of Democrats as soft on black crime. Paul is trying to win black and other minority votes by confronting their stereotype of Republicans as indifferent to white racism. By 1992, the rise of crime had made liberal Democrats so desperate that they were willing to accept Clinton's embrace of policies that made them uncomfortable. Today, demographic change is making some conservative Republicans desperate enough to accept Paul's embrace of policies that make them uncomfortable. If Republicans are smart, they will heed the shifting politics of crime and follow Paul's lead.\n\n* This post originally stated that Horton committed murder while on furlough. We regret the error."

      "text": "Conservatives and \"Liberal Guilt\"\n\nThis Ron Rosenbaum column praising liberal guilt (and suggesting that conservatives ought to feel some too) inspires Ezra Klein to write :\n\nI think Reihan makes one important rejoinder to this point, noting that part of the conservative critique of \"liberal guilt\" has to do with the (arguably) perverse effects of a politics based on remorse over what your ancestors did - whether it's left-wing Westerners making excuses for Third World tyrants or left-wing Americans accusing anyone who wanted to talk about crime and social pathology in minority communities of \"blaming the victim.\" But the deeper question remains: Its political consequences aside, is guilt an appropriate response to the sins of your ancestors (whether biological or ideological)? Or is it a character flaw - a form of self-congratulatory scrupulosity? I'm not sure what my answer would be, but I don't think it's fair to say that the latter argument \"doesn't actually make any sense.\"\n\nConsider this passage from Rosenbaum:\n\nBut Buckley felt guilty because his writing made him directly complicit in the perpetuation of Jim Crow. And yes, there are many conservatives of his generation, and to a lesser extent the generation after, who should feel guilty because of things that they themselves said and did. But what's at issue in the debate over \"liberal guilt\" isn't whether Buckley should feel guilty about what Buckley did; it's whether I , as a twentysomething conservative, should feel guilty about what he did - and, more broadly, whether I, as a twentysomething white American, should feel guilty about what white Americans used to do to black Americans. (Or to further confuse things, whether someone like Ramesh Ponnuru, as a thirtysomething Asian-American conservative, should feel guilty about what white conservatives said and did in the past.) One provisional answer would be to say no to guilt, and yes to shame: I think they're different emotions, and that shame's connection to \"dishonor\" rather than \"culpability\" makes it a more appropriate response to sins that you yourself are only complicit in indirectly, through the ties of blood or citizenship or ideological fellow-travelership. But shame, in turn, only makes sense in relation to communities that you wish to associate yourself with, or that you can't disassociate yourself from even if you tried. So where race and racism are concerned, I feel much more ashamed as an American than I do as a twenty-first century conservative, because I feel a stronger loyalty to the America of the 1950s (or the 1850s) than I do to the conservative movement of the 1950s. I'm sure I would have subscribed to the early National Review and felt philosophical affinities with many of its writers, but I'm also pretty sure - allowing for the faint absurdity of any such hypothetical - that I wouldn't have self-identified a Buckleyite right-winger during the Civil Rights Era, and I don't think it makes sense to feel shame over the decades-old conduct of people you wouldn't have agreed with at the time just because the shifting currents of American politics eventually landed you in the same political camp. Certainly, it would be absurd to insist that figures like Charlton Heston or Richard John Neuhaus, who were courageous civil-rights activists long before they became associated with the conservative point of view on gun control or abortion, should feel guilty over things their future ideological allies did and said, but that they themselves opposed. Obviously, the situation is less clear cut for those born to late to choose a side. But the conservatism that I would associate myself with wasn't born until the neoconservative turn in the 1970s, and to the extent that I feel ashamed of the conservative record on race, it's the post-1970s record - which obviously contains its share of sins - that I keep uppermost in mind."

And, you know, it's been pretty consequential to trying to understand this thing called the racial wealth gap, that most people have concluded is rooted in the disparities between access to homeownership. But I was - you know, and so the history tends to stop around 1968, when the Fair Housing Act was passed. And, you know, one of the questions that I often encounter as someone who teaches about the history of housing discrimination is: What happened after that? And so, you know, I wanted to really look at: Why, even after the federal government stops its practices of redlining, does racism persist?\n\nAnd one of the things that I try to look at in the book is how the federal government doesn't really upend the consequences of segregation. It just says, you know, from this point on, segregation is not legal, without actually dealing with the issues that precipitated that moment. And the conditions that are created after decades of disinvestment, neglect, exclusion and isolation really become the basis upon which lenders and the real estate industry, in total, treat black consumers differently. And the result is that for African Americans, even those who are able to access homeownership, that it's done on different terms, that it's more expensive, that it is typically confined to a market that is seen to have less value. So, even those black people who are able to purchase a home, it comes to mean something different than it does for their white peers, where the house has become an asset that accrues in value over time. Often for African Americans it becomes a debt burden and not an accruing asset for which - which can be passed on to their children. So, I was interested in looking at why these patterns of inequality continue to exist even when the law is formally changed.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, in your book, obviously, you go through the - you refer to the earlier periods of the '30s, '40s and '50s, when you really, in essence, had a dual market. You had a private market for homeownership, and then you had the federal government, especially after - as part of the New Deal, building public housing, largely even then segregated - white public housing and black public housing. But then, around the '70s, you get all the rise of these public-private partnerships. And then you talk about what happens, especially in the '70s, in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit, St. Louis and others -\n\nKEEANGA - YAMAHTTA TAYLOR : Yeah.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: - with the failures of the federal government's attempts to promote homeownership among African Americans. I'm wondering if you could expound on that.\n\nKEEANGA - YAMAHTTA TAYLOR : Sure. I mean, I think that the popularity of public-private partnerships really derived from the Johnson administration. I mean, there's a whole entire history of the private sector in collaboration with the federal government to, you know, do everything from build railroads to its original homeownership programs in the 1930s. So that aspect isn't new. But there is a - the newness of the programs that I look at are the ways that these partnerships are used to build and produce low-income housing. But what is different with the Johnson administration is that it's caught between the bind of Vietnam and the pressures at home, the mass rebellions that happened throughout the 1960s. And to avoid a larger deficit even becoming even larger, Johnson engages in these partnerships with the real estate and banking industries to kind of shift the production of low-income housing, whether it's homeownership or whether it's rentals, to the private sector.\n\nAnd there are all sorts of problems with that. I mean, the main one is that it's the real estate and banking industries that have been largely responsible for the dearth of good, affordable, safe and sound housing in African-American communities in the first place. And so, what does it mean then for the federal government to partner with these institutions, for which race, racism and racial discrimination, has been so critical to its bottom line in the first place, keeping white neighborhoods exclusively white and keeping black people locked in deteriorating and dilapidated housing? And because of segregation and the enclosure that it ensures means that black people have very few options and, in many ways, are a captured audience. And so, what does it mean for the federal government to then empower, with its resources, mortgage guarantees and subsidies, this particular sector?\n\nAnd I think that there's a more fundamental problem that I definitely locate in my research, which is that these are - there are two really opposing set of objectives here, where you have private real estate corporations and banks that are primarily interested in making money. Why is there no real affordable housing in the United States? Why is this a perennial problem that has never been solved? Because there's no money in creating affordable housing for poor and working-class people. There's no money to be made. So that when that is left to the private sector to fulfill, you know, it always comes up short, because there's no money to be made in housing those kinds of people. So you have the profit motive from the private sector, but then, you know, what is the public policy for? It's to promote public welfare. And so, these are two opposing goals: profiteering and public welfare. And to put them together erupts into, you know, a million different kinds of contradictions that play themselves out in these programs.\n\nAnd one of the biggest problems that emerge is then the inability of the federal government to actually enforce its own civil rights laws, to aggressively regulate its programs, because, you know, if you're in partnership with these entities and the federal government itself has divested from creating housing, from producing housing, managing it on its own on a nonprofit basis, then - and has become completely reliant on the private sector to produce this housing, then it makes it difficult to police and punish its private partners when they begin to engage in fraudulent and corrupt practices. And so, all down the line, I found conflicts of interest and contradictions that could not be overcome in these policies. And the result, you know, are a series of not just failed programs, but a host of tens of thousands of foreclosures that are centered in African-American working-class communities, that then work to devalue the surrounding properties, and that a generation later become the basis upon which these communities and the people who live in them are declared to be subprime.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Princeton professor Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, whose book is just out. It's called Race for Profit . You quote President Nixon, who famously said, \"If they own their own homes, they won't burn the cities down.\" So, you talk about the shift away from excluding black Americans from homeownership in the '60s and early '70s, and you say that \"Racist exclusion gave way to predatory inclusion.\" Explain what you mean.\n\nKEEANGA - YAMAHTTA TAYLOR : Sure. I think that a basic tenet of liberalism in the period after the Second World War, really through the 1960s into the early 1970s, is that America is basically a good society. The problems that African Americans are facing is one that comes from exclusion, that, essentially, if black people are included into the same institutions that have produced this enormous white middle class after the Second World War, then those institutions can play the same role in black communities. So, the problem is exclusion, and all we need is inclusion. And the problem for that outlook is that it doesn't actually allow us to understand the institutions that we are suggesting black people be integrated into. And so, from the purview of housing, the problems with this idea of just shifting from exclusion to inclusion become very clear.\n\nAnd so, I describe the inclusion of African Americans into conventional real estate practices and mortgage banking as predatory. And it's really a way to understand how the previous period impacts the contemporary moment, meaning that the decades of disinvestment, of racist exclusion of African Americans from the conventional real estate market, you know, create a tremendous amount of distress in black communities. It is at the root of substandard housing in black communities. And those become the basis upon which even when African Americans are included, for them to be treated differently, for them to be seen as more risky. And the whole notion of risk gives the banks and real estate industry an excuse to charge African Americans more, to subject them to less secure banking methods, all of which end up putting African Americans in - making them vulnerable to new predatory practices that aren't exactly like the previous examples, like, you know, the use of contracts in lieu of conventional mortgages. And Chicago is one example. So they're not quite that way, but it means that, you know, African Americans have to rely on unregulated mortgage banks as opposed to commercial banks with better interest rates and a better situation overall.\n\nSo, it's really trying to look critically at the institutions and practices themselves, and not just whether or not African Americans are present and able to actively participate. We need to look at the institutions themselves and the practices themselves to determine whether or not this is the best way to increase social mobility for black people.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I wanted to ask you - you begin your book with one home buyer, Janice Johnson, in 1970, trying to get a mortgage, an FHA mortgage. You live in Philadelphia. And Philadelphia was really, actually, the epicenter of the FHA crisis -\n\nKEEANGA - YAMAHTTA TAYLOR : Yeah.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: - of the 1970s. I remember I lived there in the 1970s, and there were about 35,000 abandoned homes, federally owned abandoned homes, and a huge squatters' movement developed, led by Milton Street and John Street, Henry De Bernardo, the Puerto Rican Alliance and others, to reclaim those homes. How did that happen? How did so many homes, federally insured by the government, all end up really paving the way for gentrification? Because once all those people were expelled from the inner cities, that's when the massive gentrification movements began in many of those cities.\n\nKEEANGA - YAMAHTTA TAYLOR : Well, the way that the programs that I look at look worked - so, they're created by the 1968 Housing and Urban Development Act. And the most well known - there are two programs that are probably the - were the most prolifically used in a city like Philadelphia: Section 235 of the '68 act and Section 221(d)(2) of the '68 Act. Section 235 was a program that allowed people to pay $200 as a down payment. The mortgage was 20% of their income, so not the value of the house. And interest rates were capped at 1%. And the issue that made this all operational was that the federal government for the first time stepped in and said, \"We will ensure the mortgages of all of these homes that are purchased under the terms of these programs in the inner city for the first time.\" And so, what mortgage insurance meant, the FHA wasn't lending money, but it told the banks that if someone defaults or goes into foreclosure, \"We will pay the loan off.\" And it essentially removed all the risk from the banking industry. And this really helped to crack wide open the urban housing market in completely unprecedented ways. And so, now you have speculators who were coming in, who were buying up properties, many of which had already been condemned or they were in very poor condition. They do a cheap rehab, which often just involved a quick coat of paint, and they would flip them to poor and working-class families that were desperate for housing.\n\nAnd one of the things that I look at in the book is the way that black mothers, black women who were living in public housing, who were welfare recipients, were particularly targeted by the real estate partners in this program, on the hope that they would go into default and that they would foreclose, because the banks were making their money not just because the loans were insured, but they made their money for every loan that they secured and on the closing costs of selling the house in the first place. And so, the more foreclosures, the more that they could take the same house that was in poor condition, and sell it and repeat this process over and over again. And so, many of these families, when they'd move into these homes, within a matter of weeks and months, realizing that they were in such deep disrepair, and themselves being on extremely fixed incomes, would just walk away.\n\nAnd so, the HUD programs were not the basis for all of the abandonment in cities during this time. There are a lot of different factors, that include the outmigration of whites, that include the beginnings of the movement of some African Americans to the suburban periphery. So there are many different pressures that are existing within the housing market in neighborhoods at this time. But the role of HUD can't be underestimated, because one of the issues that arises is that as these properties, some of - many of which the value has been inflated because HUD has hired part-time real estate agents as appraisers, who - it's a low-wage job. They are susceptible to bribes. Real estate agents bribe them to inflate the value of the homes. And so, when these houses go back to HUD , they can't be resold, because they've been overvalued. And so, that is why HUD's housing reserves become so large. And so what they do is they start selling - having open auctions for these houses, selling them for anywhere between a dollar and $100, which then invites speculators to come back in to buy the houses and to begin the process all over again. So, even if HUD wasn't responsible for all of the abandonment issues that are happening in the cities at this time, these actions certainly weren't helpful.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And I'm wondering also - there are some housing advocates, especially in the African-American and Latino community, who have claimed for years that there was a political purpose, as well as a racial bias, in federal housing policy. They point to the 1974, I think, Community Development Act that specifically set out a goal of spatial deconcentration of the inner city, to -\n\nKEEANGA - YAMAHTTA TAYLOR : Yes.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: - in essence, because, as you pointed out, the government was so worried about riots and unrest in the inner city, that there was a political project to remove African Americans and Latinos from the inner city, in essence, to defuse the danger to urban America.\n\nKEEANGA - YAMAHTTA TAYLOR : Well, there certainly was a debate about it. I don't think that there was a consensus position. Even you look in the - within the Nixon administration, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the mysterious liberal who ends up coming up with all of these conservative positions and then is an adviser to Richard Nixon, definitely favored a political project of deconcentration, meaning pushing African Americans into the suburbs at a moment when black people are concentrated in cities, which for the first time becomes the basis of political power. And this coincides with what we see as the emergence of the black political class and black elected officials, new mayors, African Americans being voted to Congress. The Congressional Black Caucus forms informally in 1969 and formally a 1971. So, this is all happening at this time. But for someone like Nixon, there's a problem, which is that, you know, he has spent the first term of his administration carefully curating the coalition of disaffected, angry white suburban homeowners. And part of the appeal that he makes to them is that \"I will keep your neighborhoods and communities white.\"\n\nAnd so, there is a big debate about where - because one of the things that the HUD Act does is that it mandates Congress to produce 26 million units of new and used housing, rehabilitated housing, within a 10-year period. And so, one of the debates that emerge is: Well, where will this housing go? It's very expensive to build in cities because of insurance costs, because of land costs. And so, this means that, you know, to keep this housing cheap and where there's plenty of space, it should be built in suburbs. White people in the suburbs don't want affordable housing, low-income housing in their communities, because they know that that will bring African Americans into those neighborhoods.\n\nWithin black politics, there's a debate among those who see the potential for the development of black politics and black elected officials based on the concentration of black people in cities, but black people in search of housing know that as a captured market within the city, that it limits their housing choices. It places downward pressure on the conditions of the housing and upward pressure on the price of housing when they are confined to one aspect of the market. So, many African-American working-class and poor African Americans want housing wherever they can secure it. So, all of that is to say that this is a highly contested issue, where African Americans should live, both from white conservatives and white political operatives, but also within the black community itself.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're going to break and then come back to this discussion. I want to ask you about Bernie Sanders' wealth tax and also this fifth anniversary of the growth of the Black Lives Matter movement. Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor is a professor at Princeton University.

We speak with Allie Young, a citizen of the Navajo Nation and founder of Protect the Sacred, who organized a horseback trail ride to the polls. She says it was important to her to motivate Indigenous youth to turn out. \"I was hearing on the ground that they weren't feeling very motivated to participate in this election,\" she says. \"I wanted to communicate to them that this is an election that we just cannot sit out.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're going to break and then come back to talk about what Native Americans can do, and that has to do with voting, which certainly people came out in force. We'd like to ask you to stay with us, Allie. We're also going to be joined by a Native American from Wisconsin. But, Jodi Archambault, in this last 30 seconds that we have you, can you, overall, talk about the massive voter turnout, at least increase in Native American turnout, not noted in the mainstream media?\n\nJODI ARCHAMBAULT : Sure. I just want to say that despite the risk of being exposed to COVID , the numbers were incredible. And I think that this is something that is often overlooked by mainstream media, only because mainstream media has a tendency to leave out the full picture when it comes to Native Americans. In fact, CNN did an infographic, and they labeled - they did a breakdown of all the different people who voted in the election, and for Native Americans, they didn't have us labeled as Native Americans. They called us \"something else,\" 6%.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We have that actual graphic right here. It says \"white.\" It says \"Latinx\" [ sic ]. It says \"Black.\" And then - or \"Latino,\" \"Black,\" and then \"something else,\" and then \"Asian.\"\n\nJODI ARCHAMBAULT : Yeah, yeah. And social media, we are very much - our resiliency is through our humor. And so, it just took off. Everybody kept saying, like, \"Custer said, 'Yeah, they sure are something else.'\" You know, Custer, from the last couple centuries ago. And a lot of people have just taken it as a call to try to bring attention to the people at CNN , to the people at the mainstream, who just continuously don't see us. They don't see us, and it's intentional, because we are a reminder of the bloodshed that it took to make this country. We're not congruent with the American dream.\n\nAnd we are still here. We're actually leading, leading the way on how to handle pandemics, because we've been through so many of them. And it's so much ingrained in our communities that we're not seeing this as - we're not victims in this; we're actually ready to fight. We're ready to push back and do what we can to protect ourselves, because it's the only way we've made it this far. And we know that people in America don't see us, so we have to do it for ourselves.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah. And, Jodi, I wanted to comment on this, because I also, when I saw this figure of \"something else\" or \"other\" in these exit polls, tried to dig down a little deeper into what was behind it, especially since it had appeared to grow by about a percentage point from the previous election. It turns out that this is a catch-all placeholder, where they include people who identify themselves as multiracial, people who declined in the exit polls to identify their race, and also Native Americans. So it's a catch-all, which - it's indefensible, but it is a complex number. And it turns out that about two-thirds of those who identified as \"other\" or \"something else\" voted for Joe Biden versus Donald Trump. So, it's a shortcut for the exit poll people not to have to do a better job of being able to parse the various parts of the electorate.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, we want to thank Jodi Archambault for joining us, citizen of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota. And we're going to continue on this issue, that Juan is just addressing, with Allie Young, who led horseback riders to the polls. She's a citizen of the Navajo Nation, founder of Protect the Sacred. And we're going to go to Wisconsin to speak with a Native American man who's been analyzing the Native American vote. No, it's not \"something else.\" It is the Native American nations of this country. Stay with us.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Tia Wood singing \"Ride to the Polls,\" a song cover of \"Old Town Road\" by Lil Nas and Billy Ray Cyrus. This is Democracy Now! I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González, as we continue to look at how Native American voters in key swing states helped to turn the 2020 presidential election for Joe Biden due to a massive increase in Native voter participation.\n\nAs we reported, on election night, CNN sparked swift backlash after posting an image of voter demographics which included a racial category labeling Native American voters as, quote, \"something else.\" They would later apologize.\n\nIn fact, it was Native American voters who helped flip several states for Biden in this year's presidential showdown. In Arizona, a state that has not gone blue since 1996, Navajo voters turned out in much higher rates than 2016, after a massive grassroots effort to get out the vote. In Wisconsin, where Biden won by just 21,000 votes, there was also a surge in Native American voter participation that helped turn the state blue. Trump won Wisconsin in 2016.\n\nFor more on voting in Indian Country and the critical role Native American voters played in this election, we're joined from Wisconsin by Burton Warrington. He's president of Indian Ave Group. He is a lawyer who served in the Interior Department. He is Menominee, Potawatomi and Ho-Chunk. Still with us in Arizona [ sic ] is Allie Young, a citizen of the Navajo Nation and founder of Protect the Sacred.\n\nAllie, if you could start off by talking about what you did in Arizona? Talk about the horseback ride that you took - actually, I understand you're now in New Mexico.\n\nALLIE YOUNG : Yes, I am. Yeah, my mom lives here in New Mexico, and I'm with my sister and my mother right now.\n\nYeah, I work with my father, who lives in Rough Rock, New - or, in Rough Rock, Arizona. Sorry. And we work together, and I've always voted in Arizona, resided with my father. And we've always done trail rides. That's our bonding thing. And we've done them throughout Navajo Nation. And this year, when we were thinking about the election, he wanted to do a Biden-Harris trail ride. And when I called him back and thought about the significance of a trail ride and the respect that our people have for the horses - and, you know, as we call it, horse medicine. And horse medicine is when you are in rhythm with the horse, and almost in sync, and you're reconnected and refocused as you ride in our own homelands and are reminded of exactly what our ancestors have fought for, our lands to still be in our own homelands, and our cultures and also our right to vote.\n\nSo, I went back to my father, and I said, \"So, what's happening with the trail ride?\" And he said, \"Yeah, I don't know. I don't think we're going to do it.\" And I said, \"I think we should do it. But with Protect the Sacred, I have to be nonpartisan, so if it's more of a getting folks out to the polls so that they can cast their ballots, I think we should do that,\" because at the same time, I think that our Native American youth - I was hearing on the ground that they weren't feeling very motivated to participate in this election, as a lot of other communities of color, because, you know, why continue participating in a system that has never worked for us and is not working for us? And I wanted to communicate to them that this is an election that we just cannot sit out.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: You're talking to me, Julie?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Keep going, Allie.\n\nALLIE YOUNG : And so, I wanted them to - I often find that our Native youth, you know, we are more educated than ever. That's why there's this resistance, because we know our history and what has happened to us historically. And also, we're more connected to technology and information than ever, and we're more eager to reconnect to our cultures, and that respect for our ancestors and our elders is still there. And so I wanted to strategize and use that and say, \"OK, let's find something that will excite our Native youth that's rooted in our culture, that will also help us reclaim Arizona,\" because, you know, I keep saying that Arizona is Indigenous DNA , it is not Republican DNA , as I heard on the news when I was watching about a month before we decided to do trail - ride to the polls. And that's what really motivated me, is because Arizona has this deep history of many tribal communities, and it is not just a place where white conservatives go to retire. And this is our homeland. And we wanted - I called on my people: \"Let's show up. Let's show them that we're still here. Let's be represented. Let's make sure that we have a seat at the table and that our voices are heard.\" And so, that's why it was so important. And I'm so happy that a lot of young people did come out. It did excite them. I got so many positive messages from our efforts. And I think it was a positive turnout.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Allie, I wanted to ask you about that. What were the results, from what you've been able to tell? Not so much, obviously, because the exit polls didn't factor in or count Native American votes, but what's been the result in the actual vote totals that you've been able to see so far?\n\nALLIE YOUNG : Yeah, well, I believe around 60-something thousand Navajos in Navajo Nation. So, Coconino County, Navajo County - which is where I did all of my work, and I vote in Navajo County - and Apache County, they all overlap the Navajo Nation. And in those areas, Navajo people turned out to vote. I think 84% of those who had registered turned out to vote, and 97% of those who cast their ballot voted for Joe Biden. And that's just incredible. That just shows the contribution of the Native vote in key swing states, in not only Navajo Nation, but there is a map that compares tribal communities, and all of those tribal communities voted blue. And so, we came out strong. I think we did do a great job in reclaiming Arizona, saying that we're still here, that we've always been here, and that now we're going to keep working to hold this new administration accountable, as well.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You know, you not only organized Navajo voters, Allie, but one of the hardest groups not so much to organize, to get out in the streets, to be activists, but to actually vote. And that's young people. Maybe it's because of your last name, Allie Young, but you sure managed to galvanize a lot of young people. What kind of message do you have for what is the most effective way to get first-time voters involved, to make them feel like they really are making a difference, when it's - you know, they haven't done this before?\n\nALLIE YOUNG : Well, my strategy was all around, you know, you've got to think about what we're working within. With young people, we are very tuned in to social media, so definitely it is a powerful tool. So, connecting with them that way, we had a huge social media strategy, and also layering in the cultural revitalization, and particularly with Native youth, but also, I think, with a lot of other youth across other communities of color, because I think we're in this amazing moment where all of our communities of color are reconnecting to our cultures and really proud of who we are and where we come from. So, using that and saying, \"Let's show up in that way. Let's show, through social media, in fighting for our representation,\" that takes work. And we have to - you know, we're not just going to automatically be talked about in the media. We have to show up.\n\nAnd that's the messaging that I used, especially for Native people, who - we're too often invisible in the media. We're called \"something else.\" And so, you know, let's turn that on its head. Let's show them that we're still here, we're not going away, and we're going to make our statements. And I think that's really effective, with especially our leaders, our young leaders today. We are very progressive. We are - I think, as Native people, we're innately activists and political, because we're not even supposed to be here. And that's definitely the messaging and strategy that I used.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Allie, we have less than a minute left, but I'm wondering just if you could quickly say what your main expectations are of the new Biden administration's policy toward Native American people?\n\nALLIE YOUNG : Yeah. Well, we're definitely going to be making sure that we're represented, especially when it comes to climate change. We do want a seat at the table. We want to be in that conversation, because we have just incredible knowledge about the ways that we respect Mother Earth, that we honor Mother Earth, and those are things that will end up saving Mother Earth. And so, learning from us and collaborating with us, and also on issues of - we're still in COVID -19, and it's still severely impacting our tribal communities, so we're expected - we're expecting them to work with us in helping us to bring the funding and the aid that we need, because $8 billion was not enough in the initial stimulus package.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you so much, Allie Young, for being with us, citizen of the Navajo Nation, organized throughout Arizona, is in New Mexico now, and founder of Protect the Sacred. And we will bring you Burton Warrington, Menominee, Potawatomi and Ho-Chunk, at democracynow.org , to talk about the critical Native voter count in Wisconsin.\n\nThis is Democracy Now!

An Analysis of New York City Mayoral Race of 2005\n\nBy Juan Gonzalez\n\nOn November 8, the voters of New York City will elect a new mayor. Incumbent Republican Michael Bloomberg is being challenged by Democrat Fernando Ferrer. Also on the ballot are half a dozen minor party candidates, including Thomas Ognibene of the Conservative Party and Tony Gronowicz of the Green Party. By the time the race is over, Bloomberg, a billionaire media mogul, will have spent more than $100 million from his personal fortune, shattering all spending records for any elected office in the United States other than president. Ferrer, a veteran politician from one of the poorest neighborhoods in the country, is running a shoestring campaign in which he has been outspent by Bloomberg by an astounding 17-to-1.\n\nBloomberg's television and radio commercials have blanketed the airwaves for months in more than a half-dozen languages, so it should come as no surprise that public opinion polls show the mayor with a commanding lead.\n\nA Ferrer victory would make him the first Latino mayor in New York history, and coming on the heels of Antonio Villaraigosa's successful run for mayor of Los Angeles earlier this year it would signal that the nation's exploding Latino population has begun to redefine and realign political power in urban America.\n\nThroughout this long campaign, however, many progressive and liberal activists in the city, even in the African American and Latino communities, have sat on the sidelines or shown little enthusiasm for the Democratic challenger. Those progressives-in an echo of Bloomberg's own campaign-claim that Ferrer is a lackluster candidate and political hack. They view the current mayor as a political moderate who is a Republican in name only, who is more conciliatory to the city's Black, Brown and poor communities than his predecessor Rudy Giuliani, and thus they regard his re-election as an acceptable and largely inevitable outcome. Most of the city's organized labor leaders have backed the Republican mayor, except for a handful of the most militant unions, such as the transit workers, the huge Local 1199, and the Professional Staff Congress, all of which are doggedly fighting to elect Ferrer.\n\nQuite simply, to a large number of progressives there is no fundamental difference between Bloomberg and Ferrer.\n\nThat viewpoint, in my opinion, is profoundly mistaken.\n\nI believe the New York mayoral race of 2005-a contest to control a government that employs some 300,000 workers and dispenses an annual budget of more than $50 billion-is a pivotal battle for the city's workers and its middle class, for the nation's 40 million Latinos and for the future of urban America.\n\nMany well-meaning progressives, unfortunately, have yet to grasp the stakes in this race, and that failure is rooted in two persistent weaknesses of the progressive movement.\n\n1. Class and racial divisions among progressives themselves 2. A lack of any rigorous analysis of the economic and political forces that are rapidly transforming everyday life in our nation's cities.\n\nI do not say these things lightly.\n\nAs a journalist who has chronicled urban politics in this country for decades, as a Puerto Rican with long experience in movements for racial and ethnic equality, and as a labor activist who has consistently fought to revive the American trade union movement, I learned long ago that outward appearances are often deceiving, that the surface manifestations of any political process often mask powerful currents swirling below.\n\nYet I have been amazed at the virtual absence of dispassionate and comprehensive analysis about this election; an analysis grounded in facts, one that places the conflict in the context of broader historical patterns, one that consistently asks: what is in the best interest of working people and the marginalized or oppressed groups of New York City? Once you begin to look at the mayoral race from that deeper perspective, you begin to realize that there have been few times in recent memory when an urban electorate faced such a clear class choice-in the personalities of the candidates, their stands on the issues, and the forces they represent.\n\nYou need only look at the traditional ruling circles of the city-the banking, corporate, real estate and media barons-to see how much they understand what's at stake. Rarely have they been so unified in their determination to defeat a candidate who comes from the \"Other New York,\" who speaks openly about economic inequality and claims to represent the working class and racial minorities.\n\nAs if to underscore that unanimity, there has bee a constant barrage of reports from the corporate media for the past several months that portrayed Ferrer as a flip-flopper, a liar, a bungler, incompetent, uninspiring, as racially divisive, even as a threat to bring back the drugs, crime and exploding welfare rolls that rabid conservatives most commonly associate with the era of the city's only black mayor, David Dinkins.\n\nMeanwhile, radical and progressive activists who routinely criticize the corporate mass media for distorted and biased reporting on national and international events issues - such as the Iraq War, civil liberties abuses, federal response to Hurricane Katrina, and global warming - have failed for the most part to discern the media distortion that has existed for month on the New York mayoral race.\n\nHave these activists been devoting so much attention to war atrocities in Baghdad that they have lost sight of the daily problems in their own Brooklyn neighborhoods? Are they more drawn to combating devastation in the Brazilian rain forest than to addressing toxic pollution in the Bronx or Brownsville? Have they quietly reconciled themselves to being political gadflies in perpetual dissent over the big national and international questions, while they avoid the issue of how progressives build mass movements at the local level for lasting social change on those everyday matters that deeply affect the American people right here - housing, jobs, public education, public safety, transportation and taxes?\n\nPersistent class and racial differences within the progressive movement often affect, in ways both conscious and unconscious, the way we react to particular political events. That is why my experience of more than 25 years of covering big city politics has convinced me that Michael Bloomberg, more than any New York mayor in memory, is systematically consolidating a velvet-glove takeover of city government on behalf of Wall Street's financiers and the city's real estate barons. I have repeatedly chronicled many of the most flagrant examples of that takeover in my column in the Daily News.\n\nThe era of Rudy Giuliani's mayoralty from 1994 to 2002, in contrast, was the period of iron-fisted government. Giuliani so polarized the city that African Americans, Latinos, and Asians, who now comprise more than two-thirds of its 8 million people, started to rebel and a broad popular opposition began to emerge around civil rights. That rebellion climaxed after the scandalous shooting of unarmed African immigrant Amadou Diallo, when more than a thousand of the city's top political and community leaders were arrested in civil disobedience protests over several weeks in front of police headquarters. The subsequent public outrage against Giuliani's authoritarian policies led to a Justice Department investigation and eventually to a consent decree against the Police Department that banned racial profiling. Only the enormous tragedy of the 9/11 attack in the waning days of Giuliani's second term managed to resurrect the former mayor's bankrupt reputation.\n\nIn the weeks after that attack, with Giuliani unable to seek re-election because of term limits, Bloomberg, a novice to government, emerged and surprised the experts when he spent an unprecedented $73 million in a campaign that narrowly defeated Public Advocate Mark Green, a veteran liberal Democrat. At first, because he exuded none of the meanness and arrogance of a Giuliani, many found Bloomberg refreshing, a possible throwback to the liberal Republicans that New York was famous for producing after World War II.\n\nBut since assuming office he has accelerated a trend by which the ruling circles of New York's white minority population have sought to permanently transform and privatize the democratic apparatus of city government. If that transformation is successful it will almost surely cripple the ability of the city's African American and Hispanic majority-and of candidates who defend the working and middle classes-to exercise any meaningful control over municipal government for decades to come.\n\nEven if they win election in future years, progressive candidates will discover that the city's control over its own revenues has been so emasculated that they will be reduced to functioning as neo-colonial puppets, with little ability to improve the welfare of the majority of city residents.\n\nA report last week by the non-profit Economic Policy Institute, for example, revealed that the city granted more than $1 billion in property tax breaks to corporations and developers during Bloomberg's first two years in office. That was an astonishing 40% increase over the last two years of Giuliani, who himself was known for giving out generous tax breaks to major corporations.\n\nMany of those tax breaks are guaranteed for 20 or 30 years, and often the discounted Payments in Lieu of Taxes (or PILOTs) that the developers agree to pay are then earmarked to finance new mega-projects, to pay off bonds for new sports facilities or to spur more luxury housing or high rise office buildings, and those revenues are inevitably assigned to new quasi-public agencies that can resist public scrutiny. By siphoning off those tax streams for decades to come, Bloomberg, like Giuliani on a smaller scale before him, is effectively dismantling the tax base that future mayors and city councils will need to pay for basic city services.\n\nThere is, however, a larger political purpose behind this strategy that few progressives have fully understood. The ruling circles of our nation have had a big problem for many decades. All the great American centers of finance and commerce, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Dallas, are now overwhelmingly populated by African Americans and immigrants from the former colonial or neo-colonial nations of the Third World, most especially from Latin America. But the financial and real estate elites still trace their origins to the diminishing white minorities of those cities. Given our nation's persistent history of racial and ethnic segregation, those elites have yet to develop close ties to or intimate knowledge about the new majorities in those cities. At the same time, systemic pressures from the capitalist market keep pushing the CEOs and real estate moguls to consolidate even tighter control over elected officials to assure ever-more lucrative government contracts, tax cuts and cheap land, and thus to further maximize profits.\n\nThus traditional democratic models, whereby the new non-white majorities in those cities would get to elect the next generation of local leaders, increasingly pose unacceptable risks to those ruling circles. In the past, business leaders simply sought to identify, groom and finance pliant local politicians they could easily manipulate, but the rapid growth of the voting power and sophistication of the new urban populations has prompted the ruling circles to embark on a wholesale reinvention of local government, to structurally remove financial control of the cities and their land away from the developing urban majorities.\n\nIn the decades after World War II, the white middle and upper classes responded to the influx of minorities by simply fleeing to the suburbs and even the exurbs. They then simply commuted by car or regional transit systems into the cities each day to administer them and conduct their commerce. But beginning with the oil crises of the late 1970s and 1980s, the limits of that absentee approach became apparent and new government policies emerged aimed at gentrifying the inner cities and bringing back the white middle class.\n\nToday, with the world approaching peak oil production, and the price of petroleum destined to skyrocket for decades to come, there is an even stronger economic imperative to reclaim greater swaths of the cities from the poor and working class, to create metropolises on the European or Latin American model, where the wealthy both inhabit and work in the central core, while the poor are relegated to huge low-income and slum housing in the distant suburban rings.\n\nThus, it is no surprise that during the past few years I have heard the same refrain from local leaders in scores of working class neighborhoods around the city: the land is being given away at fire sale prices to huge developers. The list of such mega-projects and land rezoning initiatives under Bloomberg is truly breath-taking: the $5 billion plans for a new Jets Stadium, luxury housing and office buildings on Manhattan's West Side; a huge project for luxury condominiums along the Williamsburg waterfront; a giant new Nets arena and high-rise luxury development in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn; a big-box retail complex in the South Bronx near Yankee Stadium: hundreds of of millions of dollars in tax abatements for Wall Street's Goldman Sachs to build a new corporate headquarters near Ground Zero. The frenzied construction of luxury housing has been accompanied by the decontrol of more than 200,000 rent stabilized apartments in the past few years that provided affordable housing for the working class; by the conversion of thousands of middle class Mitchell-Lama units to market-rate housing, and by virtually no construction of low-income housing. In every neighborhood, local leaders tell me the same story: City Hall is circumventing established mechanisms of public oversight and community control, making backroom deals with developers and bankers, steamrolling any opposition to its wholesale land giveaways.\n\nAlready more than 500,000 New York City households are paying more than 50% of their income for rent. The poor and working class are literally being pushed out, only to be replaced by wealthy new resident who comes from around the United States and even overseas (given the weak U.S. dollar and historically low low interest rates, it has become more attractive than ever for rich Europeans and Asians to invest in condominiums and other property in New York and other U.S. cities).\n\nA similar type of disregard for democratic procedures has been evident in Bloomberg's policies of preventive arrests by the New York police to thwarting mass protests-whether against the war in Iraq in 2003, at the Republican convention in 2004, or even the monthly bicycle protests of the environmental group Critical Mass.\n\nIt has been evident, also, in public education, the area of public policy that Bloomberg claims as his greatest success. One of the mayor's first acts was to seize direct control of the schools by abolishing both the Board of Education and the 32 separate community school boards. While many of those elected boards, which were created during the community control battles of the 1970s, had become corrupt and ineffectual, they remained the only mechanism by which black and Hispanic parents could make their voices heard on education issues. Today there is virtually no community input into public school policy. The directors of the city's Department of Education, all appointed by the mayor, merely rubber stamp decisions made in City Hall. Parents and teachers I have interviewed tell me they are shut out of local school management and they claim classroom curriculum has just one overriding goal-improving standardized test scores.\n\nThat is not to say all of Bloomberg's policies have been a disaster. Some reforms he has instituted in education, social services and public health have been positive and were long overdue. But those few reforms pale next to his systematic dismantling of the city's lost established structures of democratic governance-a process that will make it possible in the future for more authoritarian leaders to rule with virtually no accountability.\n\nThe Fernando Ferrer campaign, despite its many faults and weaknesses, has mounted a direct challenge to Bloomberg's anti-democratic policies. It has opposed the \"City for Sale\" sign for real estate developers. It has called for an end to the massive housing displacement of the city's working class and poor communities.\n\nFrom a class and racial perspective, the policy differences between Ferrer and Bloomberg are indeed stark.\n\nFerrer, for example, backed a lead paint removal bill passed by City Council to protect poor children from lead poisoning, while Bloomberg vetoed the bill, then after Council overrode his veto he backed a long and unsuccessful court challenge to overturn the law.\n\nFerrer has opposed the establishment of of big box non-union stores like Wal-Mart and Target in the city unless they agree to basic labor protections and to provide health benefits for their employees, while Bloomberg has welcomed the stores and even offered them tax incentives.\n\nFerrer has backed a living wage bill in Council, while Bloomberg has opposed it.\n\nFerrer has urged the return of a stock transfer tax to require Wall Street traders to help finance city public schools, and the reimposition of a commuter tax so that suburbanites who use city services each day pay their fair share of costs, Bloomberg has opposed the stock transfer tax and provided only lukewarm support to the commuter tax. Instead the mayor increased property taxes on all homeowners by 18%, and he ordered a drastic increase in the prices of parking and other nuisance summonses, all of which have disproportionately hurt the working class.\n\nFerrer has opposed the war in Iraq, called for withdrawal of U.S. troops and opposed military recruitment in schools, while Bloomberg has largely backed the war, or at least refused to criticize President Bush's handling of it, and has supported military recruitment in the schools.\n\nDespite those stark policy differences, many black and white progressives remain unconvinced about Ferrer. Some point to Ferrer's statements on the Diallo shooting as a reason. Earlier this year, speaking at a meeting of police sergeants, Ferrer said he did not believe the shooting had been a crime, that the four cops involved had been a product of terrible training and accountability under the Giuliani-controlled Police Department. They should have been fired, he said, but not sent to jail. He said this even though he had been one of the many public officials arrested in front of Police Headquarters in the protests against the shooting. While it is true that Ferrer raised the same issue of accountability back then when he was arrested, many saw his latest Diallo statement as duplicitous and as pandering to conservative supporters of law-and-order. He has since apologized several times for the remark but the corporate media have consistently dogged him with questions about Diallo.\n\nThat statement, in effect, has been turned into a handy tool with which to drive a wedge between the black community and the Ferrer campaign, even though most black political leaders in the city continue to back him, including Al Sharpton who organized the original Diallo protests. Those black leaders have not forgotten that Ferrer was one of the authors of the controversial legislation that created a Civilian Complaint Review Board in the late 1980s and that he has spoken out against police abuse on more than one occasion.\n\nBoth black and white progressives, however, have yet to admit a certain uneasiness they feel about the Ferrer campaign, one that is rarely broached in public. That uneasiness stems from the astonishing growth of the Latino population, not only in New York but around the nation. The 2000 Census reported that 28% of the city's population, nearly 2.2 million people, were Hispanic. Five years later, that number is probably closer to 2.5 million, and by the end of the decade is likely to surpass 2.8 million-or about 35% of all city residents.\n\nFor white progressives this is an especially difficult trend to confront, because they, like the white upper class conservatives, find themselves increasingly surrounded by a population that is culturally and ethnically distinct from the America that they once knew and grew up in. Given the unconscious attitudes of racial or ethnic superiority that still exist in much of white America, it is easy to understand how so many white progressives could easily succumb to a media narrative that continually denigrates a Latino candidate like Ferrer as bumbling and incompetent. Many Blacks and Hispanics, no matter how educated or professional they are, have confronted the same questioning or dismissal of their skills and abilities on a daily basis in this country, from both white conservatives and white progressives, many of whom do not even realize the chauvinist underpinnings of their attitudes.\n\nWhen Bloomberg ran for mayor in 2001 against Mark Green, for instance, progressive whites uniformly backed Green, who came came from a wealthy family (his brother is a millionaire real estate developer), and who had long been part of Manhattan's upper class elite. In 1997, Rudy Giuliani won re-election in a landslide against Democrat Ruth Messinger. Messinger, too,was a longtime member of Manhattan's Upper West Side liberal circles, though admittedly a more radical one,, so progressives had no problem flocking to her campaign. In 1989, by the time David Dinkins was elected mayor, he had already become part of the New York political and social scene as Manhattan borough president. Dinkins was considered an \"acceptable\" candidate by a significant sector of the city's invisible government and by Manhattan's liberals Democrats. For example, Robert Rubin, the Wall street executive later to become Treasury Secretary under Bill Clinton was an early and ardent backer of Dinkins.\n\nFerrer, on the other hand, has never been accepted by Manhattan's ruling elite, especially not by the richest Democrats. Steven Rattner, one of the national Democratic Party's biggest fundraisers, publicly declared several weeks ago that he didn't know anyone in New York who was backing Ferrer. He meant, of course, that he didn't know any glitterati like himself who were supporting him. Meanwhile Bill and Hillary Clinton, the royalty of the Democratic Party, endorsed Ferrer on the one hand while openly signaling to their biggest donors and to the corporate media that this was not a campaign they would fight seriously to win.\n\nThe domination of city politics by Manhattan's upper classes has become so commonplace that most people never even notice it. Ferrer, for example, is the first major party mayoral candidate to come from outside of Manhattan in nearly 30 years - since Mario Cuomo from Queens ran on the Liberal Party line against Ed Koch in 1977.\n\nBut impoverished class origins hardly qualify anyone to be mayor of New York. His detractors note that Ferrer simply doesn't have the leadership abilities to hold the second-toughest job in America.\n\nTo hear them, you might imagine that New York City history is replete with charismatic, enlightened and outstanding mayors. Just consider for a moment some of the men-and they have all been men - who have occupied New York's City Hall. Fiorello LaGuardia, of course, is perhaps the best example of a great mayor who both defended the interests of the city's working class and ran an efficient government. But before LaGuardia, there was Jimmy Walker, the dapper 1920s figure who enjoyed unmatched popularity and fawning press coverage while presiding over rampant corruption, and who ended up fleeing the country in 1932 to escape arrest. Then there was William O'Dwyer, another popular Tammany Hall mayor of the 1940s. He also resigned in disgrace in 1950 as more than one hundred cops including his top police officials were being ousted in a massive bribery scandal. O'Dwyer was followed in office by a total incompetent, Anthony Impelliteri, who in turn was followed by another Democratic Party hack, Robert Wagner. From O'Dwyer through Wagner, real power in the city was wielded by a man the voters never elected to anything. His name was Robert Moses and he did more than any political leader in the 20th century to define the architecture, financial structures and class divisions of New York and other American cities. After Wagner, came John Lindsay, Abe Beame, Ed Koch, Dinkins, Giuliani and now Bloomberg. Lindsay, perhaps the most charismatic and inspiring of them all, created the massive borrowing and deficit budgets that later bankrupted the city under Beame.\n\nMy point in reviewing this gallery of leaders is to underscore how impeccable competency and political purity have rarely been hallmarks of New York City mayors. Even the best had more than their share of human frailties, and a few were absolute scoundrels even while they enjoyed huge popularity.\n\nToday, when television marketing is the principal instrument for social control, the corporate media want us all to choose our politicians like we choose cereals or cars or sneakers-digesting the message in the ads they create without even thinking. They would have rally to a personality divorced from history, from race and class and gender, from political parties, from ideologies, even from elementary stands on major issues.\n\nIt is in this context that we should begin to view this battle between Bloomberg and Ferrer. Between a billionaire who enjoys the power of incumbency, the unanimous support of the city's corporate elite, the backing, in both editorials and news coverage, of all its main outlets, and who has $100 million to spread his message everywhere, and an imperfect Latino politician from the Bronx, armed only with a progressive program and a commitment to defend the city's workers and democratic rule.\n\nSo why is such a massive propaganda campaign necessary against an opponent all the polls claim has no chance of victory? Could it be that New York's elite and the Bloomberg campaign know something the rest of us don't? Are they perhaps more worried about the massive demographic changes and voter discontent than even we realize? Could such a huge and expensive campaign be needed precisely to convince the new majority of voters that the pervasive and steady theft of democratic government they are witnessing, the massive dislocation of the working class and the poor from New York-the kind of nightmare scenario that Hurricane Katrina recently fast-forwarded in New Orleans - isn't really happening at all?\n\nAt this stage, it is remotely possible but extremely improbable that Ferrer can engineer an upset victory over Mayor Bloomberg next week. Admittedly, there are 200,000 new Democratic voters who registered for the first time during last year's presidential election, and no pollster has any idea how many of them will show up on Election Day. But such a victory remains extremely unlikely and would require an enormous groundswell by activists in the final days.\n\nNo matter the outcome, however, the Ferrer campaign accomplished much against overwhelming odds. It has forced a major public discussion on the growing economic divide in urban America, and exposed how Bloomberg's rule is affecting the working class and the poor. Thanks to his constant pressure, the mayor was forced to conclude a flurry of long-stalled labor union negotiations in the last month of the race and grant substantial raises to the city's teachers, firefighters, police, correction officers, and sanitation workers, just to keep those unions from backing his opponent. Bloomberg also adopted a raft of new reforms in housing, education and health policies in response to Ferrer's criticism.\n\nMillions of Latino workers in this city and around the country have followed this race, as they did the Villaraigosa race, more closely than others realize. Those works, who have been the invisible backbone for much of the nation's prosperity for decades, have been energized into greater political action, the results of which will be felt for decades to come.\n\nIf there is any shame in this race, it belongs to New York's progressive movement, many of whose members failed to properly analyze the stakes of the conflict from the start, while others, succumbing to their class and racial biases, failed to rally behind one of the more better working class mayoral candidates in our city's modern history. Hopefully, we will all learn the lessons of this conflict, because the working class and the new majorities of our cities are inevitably the ones who most suffer when progressive leaders desert the very principles they espouse.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Many progressives and civil rights groups have urged Democratic leaders to kill the filibuster, warning that if they don't, Senate Republicans will obstruct Biden's plans just as they did with the Obama administration. Former Senate aide Adam Jentleson, author of the new book \"Kill Switch: The Rise of the Modern Senate and the Crippling of American Democracy,\" says the filibuster has historically been used to stop racial progress and thwart majority opinion. \"The framers ... did not want the filibuster to exist,\" he says. \"When they created the Senate, it was an institution that had no filibuster power. It was designed to be a majority-rule body.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! The Quarantine Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers are moving ahead with plans to hold an impeachment trial of former President Trump for inciting the deadly January 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. House impeachment managers are walking the single article of impeachment to the Senate today. The Senate trial will begin the week of February 8th. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer spoke Friday.\n\nMAJORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER : Now, as I mentioned, the Senate will also conduct a second impeachment trial for Donald Trump. I've been speaking to the Republican leader about the timing and duration of the trial. But, make no mistake, a trial will be held in the United States Senate, and there will be a vote on whether to convict the president.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : As senators prepare for the impeachment trial, lawmakers are also debating how to move forward on President Biden's proposed $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill. The Senate is split 50-50, but the Democrats control the Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as a tiebreaking vote.\n\nSchumer and former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell are locked in negotiations over how the Senate will be run over the next two years. McConnell is pushing to preserve the filibuster, which allows any senator to block a bill's passage unless it's supported by 60 senators. Critics say the filibuster is a relic of the Jim Crow era that preserves minority rule. A group of civil rights and social justice groups are pushing Democrats to eliminate the filibuster to limit McConnell's power and give Biden a chance to enact his agenda.\n\nOn Sunday, Senator Bernie Sanders, who's the incoming Senate Budget Committee chair, appeared on CNN and promoted using a process known as reconciliation to quickly pass part of Biden's COVID relief plan.\n\nSEN . BERNIE SANDERS : What we cannot do is wait weeks and weeks and months and months to go forward. We have got to act now. That is what the American people want. Now, as you know, reconciliation, which is a Senate rule, was used by the Republicans, under Trump, to pass massive tax breaks for the rich and large corporations. It was used as an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And what we are saying is, \"You used it for that. That's fine. We're going to use reconciliation - that is, 50 votes in the Senate plus the vice president - to pass legislation desperately needed by working families in this country right now. You did it. We're going to do it. But we're going to do it to protect ordinary people, not just the rich and the powerful.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : To talk more about the state of the Senate, we're joined by Adam Jentleson, the public affairs director at Democracy Forward, former deputy chief of staff to Democratic Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. Jentleson's new book is titled Kill Switch: The Rise of the Modern Senate and the Crippling of American Democracy .\n\nSo, let's start with what's happening in the Senate right now. You say it's the most unequal body in the U.S. federal government. Explain why, and how that impacts everything from reconciliation to the filibuster.\n\nADAM JENTLESON : That's right. And thanks for having me here. It's great to join you today.\n\nSo, you know, the Senate was created to provide a counterbalance to the House, which was supposed to be - the House was supposed to be sort of the direct body that represented the people. And the Senate was always designed to provide sort of an elite counterweight. And it was designed to be a little bit anti-democratic, in its inception.\n\nYou know, in the House, apportionment is determined by population, so every district is about the same size, and every state has about the same number of House members proportional to their population, so the bigger states have a lot more representatives. California has many more representatives in the House than, say, Wyoming, which has one representative.\n\nIn the Senate, every state gets equal representation. So, Wyoming has two senators, and California has two senators. California's population is about 39 million people. Wyoming's population is about 600,000 people. So, by that proportionate representation, it actually creates a disproportionate voting power. So, every citizen in Wyoming has many more times the voting power than a citizen in California.\n\nThis was something that the framers were aware of when they created it, but some of them decried it at the time and said this is a big problem. Madison, who's often cited as the chief framer and constructor of the Senate, actually strongly opposed this kind of equal representation. And when I say \"equal,\" I mean the same number of senators; the way it plays out is actually, you know, dramatically unequal representation for the actual voters. Madison, at the time, said that it would be a great source of - he used the word - \"injustice\" to give states equal representation. At the time that he called this an injustice, the biggest state was Virginia, and it was about 10 times as big as the smallest state, Delaware. Madison was right that it creates an injustice, but that injustice is several orders of magnitude bigger now than at the time. You know, Virginia was 10 times the size of Delaware in 1789. Today, California is about 70 times the size of Wyoming. So, it is an unequal body. The way this -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Seventy times the size. And for people who listen to this globally, each of them, because they're each a state, have two senators, have equal representation in the Senate.\n\nADAM JENTLESON : That's right. And because a lot of - and, you know, the way this plays out is that what that translates to is not just disproportionate representation geographically, but disproportionate presentation in terms of racial, ethnic, minority voting power. California, obviously, is an incredibly diverse state. Wyoming is an incredibly monolithic state demographically. But Wyoming has equal voting power to California. And this continues throughout, if you go down the chamber, because the general pattern is that the more rural states, the lower-population states, tend to be overwhelmingly white. And so, what that translates to in our modern era is a dramatically disproportionate amount of voting power to white conservatives in America.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, take this to the history of the filibuster. I want to play just a clip of President Obama speaking about the filibuster at the funeral of the late Georgia Congressmember John Lewis.\n\nPRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : And if all this takes eliminating the filibuster, another Jim Crow relic, in order to secure the God-given rights of every American, then that's what we should do.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"Another Jim Crow relic,\" says Obama. You take this back, Adam, to slavery.\n\nADAM JENTLESON : That's right. And Obama is 100% right. He's been consistent on the filibuster. He's always wanted to get rid of it. In his new memoir, he says he wishes he had started his first administration by rallying Democrats to get rid of it, so that he could have passed more and bigger things. But, yes, he's absolutely right about the history.\n\nThe history, you know, it's important to understand that the framers, for all their own racism and slaveholding status, even they did not want the filibuster to exist. When they created the Senate, it was an institution that had no filibuster power. It was designed to be a majority-rule body. It was designed to discourage obstruction. They were very clear about this; this wasn't just sort of a coincidence or sort of a gray area. The reason they were clear about it was that they created the Constitution in the shadows of the Articles of Confederation, and the widespread view at the time was that the reason the Articles of Confederation failed was that its Congress required a supermajority threshold to pass most major legislation. And so, the framers saw that that had been a disaster, and they created a Senate that was majority rule.\n\nAnd they wrote very clearly in The Federalist Papers , in their own correspondence and other sources that they believed that a minority, a numerical minority, in the Senate should not be given the power to obstruct what the majority wanted to do. By all means, the Senate was supposed to be deliberative. It was supposed to be thoughtful. It was supposed to take things a little slower than the House. But there was a certain point at which debate was considered to have run its course. And at that point, a majority was allowed to end debate, bring the bill up for a vote and pass or fail it on a majority vote.\n\nWhat happened was, over the course of several decades, after all the framers had passed away, other senators did use some obstructive tactics over the early decades, but it was very rare. John C. Calhoun came along, the \"Great Nullifier,\" senator from South Carolina, sort of a grandfather of the Confederacy, and he innovated some of the tactics that became known as the modern filibuster. And he did it for the express purpose of increasing the power of the slaveholding class. What he saw at this time - this was around the 1830s and 1840s - was that slaveholders and slave states were becoming steadily outpowered in Congress. And so, he knew that if majority rule was allowed to continue, slavery was going to end. And they needed to - he felt a very compelling desire, from his perspective, to increase their power in the Senate.\n\nAnd so, what he did was innovate what we would describe as the modern talking filibuster, the sort of Jimmy Stewart-style holding the floor, joining with allies, to delay a bill that he opposed, and, at the same time, doing it all in the service of this lofty principle of minority rights. And what he - the minority that he sought to protect was not a vulnerable population, by any means. It was the planter class, the slaveholders. And so, that was the origin of this essential principle of minority rights being tied to the filibuster. It was a desire to protect not a vulnerable minority, but the minority of the planter class against the march of progress, that Calhoun thought would progress under a majority-rule system.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, take that to today and this battle over the filibuster in the Senate, the trajectory you see from slavery to Jim Crow to the new Biden administration and the Democratic majority, and what they're trying to do -\n\nADAM JENTLESON : Sure.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - whether we're talking about COVID relief or talking, for example, about impeachment.\n\nADAM JENTLESON : Sure. So, the key development in the history of the filibuster, from the time of Calhoun to now, is the transition from this talking filibuster, you know, the Jimmy Stewart-style holding the floor, into a supermajority threshold that can be applied to block any bill. And just to underscore, for the first 200 years of its existence or so, the Senate was majority rule. Even as the filibuster started to develop in Calhoun's time, all that senators could do was delay a bill. They had to talk on the floor, and eventually they had to give up. There was no ability to impose a supermajority threshold.\n\nThat didn't arise until after 1917, when the Senate put a rule on the books that, ironically, was designed to end filibusters. It implemented a supermajority threshold under the principle that after debate had gone for long enough, two-thirds of the body would be able to come together and say, \"You know what? This is enough. Let's cut this off. Let's move to a final debate - a final vote on the bill.\"\n\nIt took a long time for this to happen, but Southern senators, in the Jim Crow era - and this gets back to what President Obama was talking about - started to reverse the purpose of that rule, and instead of using it to end debate, as it had been designed to do, started using it as a higher threshold for civil rights bills to have to clear. And it's important to underscore how transformative the power of racism was in this evolution. The only category -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And then, we just have a minute.\n\nADAM JENTLESON : Oh, OK.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We just have a minute, but I wanted to take this forward to what's happening now and play a clip of the incoming Senate Budget Committee chair, Bernie Sanders, speaking on CNN , defending his call for using reconciliation to pass the COVID relief bill, and then ask how that fits into this paradigm you're describing.\n\nSEN . BERNIE SANDERS : And I criticized the Republicans, yeah, for using reconciliation to give tax breaks to billionaires, to create a situation where large, profitable corporations now pay zero in federal income taxes. Yes, I did criticize them for that. And if they want to criticize me for helping to feed children who are hungry, or senior citizens in this country who are isolated and alone and don't have enough food, they can criticize me. I think it's the appropriate step forward.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that is Bernie Sanders, yes, Senator Mittens, for those who have been following the, to say the least, viral meme of him wearing his Vermont mittens at the inauguration. But, Adam Jentleson, if you could end by talking about what this means for the COVID relief bill, who gets helped, and who doesn't?\n\nADAM JENTLESON : Sure. So, what Sanders has done is accurately identify a process called budget reconciliation, that is an end run around this supermajority threshold that I was describing. That threshold has gone, from the Jim Crow era, from being only applied to civil rights bills to today being applied to every bill. And this is the primary source of gridlock in the Senate.\n\nAs the budget chair, Sanders can use reconciliation to go around it. That can be used for the COVID relief bill. He's absolutely right about that. That may be where we go. It will enable us to pass COVID relief over the objections of Republicans and not have to clear a 60-vote threshold.\n\nLong term, though, the filibuster will rear its head, because anything involving civil rights, democracy reforms or those types of reforms cannot go through reconciliation. Reconciliation is a restrictive process that has tight rules. They have to be budgetary items to conform with its rules. So, ultimately, we're going to have to face this question of the filibuster, if we want to do things like D.C. statehood, Puerto Rico statehood, any kind of civil rights expansions, automatic voter registration. All of that stuff can't go through reconciliation. If we don't reform the filibuster, it will die by the filibuster. So, that's where this issue will really come to a head for Democrats.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Adam Jentleson, I want to thank you for being with us, public affairs director for Democracy Forward, former deputy chief of staff to the Democratic majority leader, Senator Harry Reid. His new book, Kill Switch: The Rise of the Modern Senate and the Crippling of American Democracy .\n\nNext up, as the number of U.S. COVID cases hits 25 million, we'll speak to the Reverend Barber about the challenges ahead. He gave the homily at the post-inaugural prayer breakfast. We'll talk about inequality. And what does unity really mean? Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nAs COVID -19 rampages through the U.S., we look at how the rapid spread of the disease is affecting Native American communities, which have already faced disproportionate infection and death rates throughout the pandemic. We speak to Jodi Archambault, a citizen of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and former special assistant to President Obama for Native American affairs. We also speak with Protect the Sacred founder Allie Young of the Navajo Nation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Today, in this special broadcast, we look at this year's historic election and the devastating COVID -19 pandemic. We begin in North Dakota, which has the highest COVID -19 death rate of any state or country in the world, with one in every thousand residents dead from the virus. South Dakota's death rate is nearly as bad, after both Republican governors spent months downplaying the crisis. As COVID -19 ravages the Dakotas, we turn to look at how the rapid spread of COVID -19 is affecting Native American communities.\n\nWe begin with two guests. Jodi Archambault is a citizen of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the former special assistant to President Obama for Native American affairs for the White House Domestic Policy Council. She's in Bismarck, the capital of North Dakota. And in Farmington, New Mexico, we're joined by Allie Young, a citizen of Navajo Nation, founder of Protect the Sacred. She lives in Arizona. I began by asking Jodi Archambault to talk about the pandemic's devastating effect on Native Americans.\n\nJODI ARCHAMBAULT : This has been a tough several months, just hoping that the government takes action. The state government, the way that they behave and the way that they react affects our people directly, mostly because we have some of the highest rates of the underlying conditions that make COVID -19 a deadly disease. And so, we're having a lot of people perish. We're having a lot of death, a lot of hospitalizations.\n\nAnd it's affecting us in ways that is not widely known by the rest of America. We have very few years - we have about maybe a decade, maybe 15 years, where we have to save our language, our Lakota language, our Dakota language. We also have other tribes in North Dakota, like the Arikara, the Mandan and the Hidatsa. Most of the speakers of our languages are over the age of 70. And we don't have very much time to spend with them and learn and protect and revitalize our languages. And COVID -19 has put on an additional layer of risk, that is just putting us into a very difficult time.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Jodi Archambault, how did it get to this stage, especially in the Native communities of the state? How did the pandemic spread so rapidly in your community?\n\nJODI ARCHAMBAULT : It didn't spread very rapidly at first. As you know, the COVID -19 hit the cities first, and hit Seattle and New York City. In North Dakota and South Dakota, we shut down the businesses and took a lot of precautions early on, until about May. And North and South Dakota were the first states to open their doors to business as usual - restaurants. People were shy at first. But at this point, there's a lot of people who have followed the line of thinking that COVID -19 is a hoax, or it's some kind of Democrat conspiracy. And a lot of people refuse to wear masks, even with a mask mandate.\n\nThis has all accelerated on the reservations. Reservations or tribal nations, such as Eagle Butte, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and the Oglala Sioux Tribe, the Sisseton, Wahpeton, Rosebud, they've all installed roadblocks. They've all implemented roadblocks to stop traffic and outsiders from coming on the reservation. And the response to their action to protect tribal members, elders and the like was for the governor, Noem, to torture them and hold them hostage with funding. She has coordinated with the Trump administration to make it difficult to receive the federal resources that are allocated to the tribal governments, and have used that as a stick for them to try to force them to take the roadblocks down. And rather than supporting them and thanking them for trying to address the lack of health services available on the reservation, she has made it more and more difficult for people, for our tribes to protect ourselves.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : North Dakota governor - can you talk about his originally saying that people who are healthcare workers who test positive for COVID should remain working if they are asymptomatic, and treat COVID -19 patients, and Governor Burgum then being forced to back down after the outcry, saying no to a mask mandate, then saying yes?\n\nJODI ARCHAMBAULT : I'll just tell you that from - we don't have - it's really hard to speak up in North Dakota. The news sources out here don't cover an alternate perspective. But I will say that the Nurses Association, an advocacy group, did issue a press release after Governor Burgum said that they could go back to work while they were testing COVID -positive. That was last week on Wednesday. And within hours, there was a pushback from the Nurses Association. None of the hospitals have taken him up on the offer. And it's ridiculous that the leadership's response to being the worst COVID rates in the world would be to allow nurses to infect other nurses, other doctors and other patients by coming to work with COVID . It's the most preposterous type of government action that I've ever heard of.\n\nSo, the business is - the business of the hospital is asking for this kind of, I guess, allowance, to allow sick people without symptoms to come and spread? But actually, this has always - the situation that we're talking about is the lack of compassion for those elders, not just Native elders, but all elders, all people with underlying health conditions, like cancer. It is an absolute choice, a clear choice, to choose profit over people. So, the governor isn't putting people first; he's putting profit first.\n\nAnd the same with Governor Noem down in South Dakota. They have been - she has been actively asking people to come to South Dakota, come to the hottest spot - second-hottest spot in the world and have your vacation, because we don't care if you wear a mask or not. That's what her response is, and to increase the risk that tribal governments - by forcing them to take down their barriers, or trying to force them down - they haven't taken them down. It's remarkable that they're able to stick to that governance decision, that is saving lives on the reservations. It's still spreading. It's still spreading on the reservations because there is active commerce between reservations and cities. And so it's getting in.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, I'd like to bring in Allie Young to the conversation, a citizen of the Navajo Nation and founder of Protect the Sacred.\n\nAllie, welcome to Democracy Now! Could you talk about the situation in Navajo Nation in terms of COVID ? And also maybe comment on the fact that not all Native areas have gaming, but quite a significant percentage do, and often it's the gaming revenues that help provide health services or social services. Could you talk about the impact of the shutdowns on the ability of Native peoples to provide health services, as well?\n\nALLIE YOUNG : Yeah. Yá'át'ééh , hello, everyone. Thank you for having me.\n\nYeah, right now we are seeing another surge in Navajo Nation, as we expected. We, as you all know, were the number one hot spot in the country per capita in the spring. And we worked hard to flatten the curve, and we were able to. There was a day where we had zero reported cases. But recently, because of the spikes across the country, what we've been seeing throughout the nation, with some of the rallies - I mean, you know, some of our border towns around here are Trump territory, and so there were rallies that I witnessed. And a lot of our people come into these border towns to do their shopping, because on Navajo Nation, you know, we have like 13 grocery stores. So we have to travel to these territories where they're not thinking about - they're not wearing masks, and they're not thinking about their neighbors who have been impacted.\n\nAnd then, to your point about the gaming industry in Native communities, at Navajo Nation we have some casinos and hotels, as well, and they've all been shut down. And it has impacted us economically, financially. And as far as healthcare, we've had to - you know, I worked on a PSA through Protect the Sacred that called out for medical volunteers. And that's the state that we were in, that we had to make that call out for PPE supplies, medical volunteers, because we just lack all of those resources and funding in our tribal communities, when we're supposed to be guaranteed quality healthcare through our treaties with the federal government.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Allie Young, you've talked about feeling that so many Native elders are suffering as a result of the decades of uranium mining, particularly of pulmonary and respiratory diseases, making them even more vulnerable. We're talking something like over 600 people just on the Navajo Reservation have died as of this weekend of COVID .\n\nALLIE YOUNG : Yes. That is something that I am trying to connect the dots to anyone I speak to: Let's not forget about how the federal government greenlit these companies coming in to extract our minerals on tribal reservations. In Navajo Nation, for 30-plus years, we had Peabody up in the northwestern region of Navajo Nation, which was our hot spot within the nation. And a lot of our people up there - the waters and our lands are contaminated by uranium. And our elders had to work through - and even my own uncles - you know, they just shut down last year, in 2019. So, a lot of our people have worked through those unsafe environments and certainly have those preexisting and underlying conditions, that we need to consider in why we're so vulnerable to this virus.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Jodi Archambault, can you, overall, talk about the massive voter turnout, at least increase in Native American turnout, not noted in the mainstream media?\n\nJODI ARCHAMBAULT : Sure. I just want to say that despite the risk of being exposed to COVID , the numbers were incredible. And I think that this is something that is often overlooked by mainstream media, only because mainstream media has a tendency to leave out the full picture when it comes to Native Americans. In fact, CNN did an infographic, and they labeled - they did a breakdown of all the different people who voted in the election, and for Native Americans, they didn't have us labeled as Native Americans. They called us \"something else,\" 6%.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We have that actual graphic right here. It says \"white.\" It says \"Latino.\" It says \"Black,\" and then \"something else,\" and then \"Asian.\"\n\nJODI ARCHAMBAULT : Yeah, yeah. And social media, we are very much - our resiliency is through our humor. And so, it just took off. Everybody kept saying, like, \"Custer said, 'Yeah, they sure are something else.'\" You know, Custer, from the last couple centuries ago. And a lot of people have just taken it as a call to try to bring attention to the people at CNN , to the people at the mainstream, who just continuously don't see us. They don't see us, and it's intentional, because we are a reminder of the bloodshed that it took to make this country. We're not congruent with the American dream.\n\nAnd we are still here. We're actually leading, leading the way on how to handle pandemics, because we've been through so many of them. And it's so much ingrained in our communities that we're not seeing this as - we're not victims in this; we're actually ready to fight. We're ready to push back and do what we can to protect ourselves, because it's the only way we've made it this far. And we know that people in America don't see us, so we have to do it for ourselves.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Still with us in Arizona [ sic ] is Allie Young, a citizen of the Navajo Nation and founder of Protect the Sacred.\n\nAllie, if you could start off by talking about what you did in Arizona? Talk about the horseback ride that you took.\n\nALLIE YOUNG : I work with my father, who lives in Rough Rock, New - or, in Rough Rock, Arizona. Sorry. And we work together, and I've always voted in Arizona, resided with my father. And we've always done trail rides. That's our bonding thing. And we've done them throughout Navajo Nation. And this year, when we were thinking about the election, he wanted to do a Biden-Harris trail ride. And when I called him back and thought about the significance of a trail ride and the respect that our people have for the horses - and, you know, as we call it, horse medicine. And horse medicine is when you are in rhythm with the horse, and almost in sync, and you're reconnected and refocused as you ride in our own homelands and are reminded of exactly what our ancestors have fought for, our lands to still be in our own homelands, and our cultures and also our right to vote.\n\nSo, I went back to my father, and I said, \"So, what's happening with the trail ride?\" And he said, \"Yeah, I don't know. I don't think we're going to do it.\" And I said, \"I think we should do it. But with Protect the Sacred, I have to be nonpartisan, so if it's more of a getting folks out to the polls so that they can cast their ballots, I think we should do that,\" because at the same time, I think that our Native American youth - I was hearing on the ground that they weren't feeling very motivated to participate in this election, as a lot of other communities of color, because, you know, why continue participating in a system that has never worked for us and is not working for us?\n\nI often find that our Native youth, you know, we are more educated than ever. That's why there's this resistance, because we know our history and what has happened to us historically. And also, we're more connected to technology and information than ever, and we're more eager to reconnect to our cultures, and that respect for our ancestors and our elders is still there. And so I wanted to strategize and use that and say, \"OK, let's find something that will excite our Native youth that's rooted in our culture, that will also help us reclaim Arizona,\" because, you know, I keep saying that Arizona is Indigenous DNA , it is not Republican DNA , as I heard on the news when I was watching about a month before we decided to do trail - ride to the polls. And that's what really motivated me, is because Arizona has this deep history of many tribal communities, and it is not just a place where white conservatives go to retire. And this is our homeland. And we wanted - I called on my people: \"Let's show up. Let's show them that we're still here. Let's be represented. Let's make sure that we have a seat at the table and that our voices are heard.\" And so, that's why it was so important. And I'm so happy that a lot of young people did come out. It did excite them. I got so many positive messages from our efforts. And I think it was a positive turnout.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Allie, I wanted to ask you about that. What were the results, from what you've been able to tell? Not so much, obviously, because the exit polls didn't factor in or count Native American votes, but what's been the result in the actual vote totals that you've been able to see so far?\n\nALLIE YOUNG : Yeah, well, I believe around 60-something thousand Navajos in Navajo Nation. So, Coconino County, Navajo County - which is where I did all of my work, and I vote in Navajo County - and Apache County, they all overlap the Navajo Nation. And in those areas, Navajo people turned out to vote. I think 84% of those who had registered turned out to vote, and 97% of those who cast their ballot voted for Joe Biden. And that's just incredible. That just shows the contribution of the Native vote in key swing states, in not only Navajo Nation, but there is a map that compares tribal communities, and all of those tribal communities voted blue. And so, we came out strong. I think we did do a great job in reclaiming Arizona, saying that we're still here, that we've always been here, and that now we're going to keep working to hold this new administration accountable, as well.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What kind of message do you have for what is the most effective way to get first-time voters involved, to make them feel like they really are making a difference, when it's - you know, they haven't done this before?\n\nALLIE YOUNG : My strategy was all around, you know, you've got to think about what we're working within. With young people, we are very tuned in to social media, so definitely it is a powerful tool. So, connecting with them that way, we had a huge social media strategy, and also layering in the cultural revitalization, and particularly with Native youth, but also, I think, with a lot of other youth across other communities of color, because I think we're in this amazing moment where all of our communities of color are reconnecting to our cultures and really proud of who we are and where we come from. So, using that and saying, \"Let's show up in that way. Let's show, through social media, in fighting for our representation,\" that takes work. And we have to - you know, we're not just going to automatically be talked about in the media. We have to show up.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Allie, I'm wondering just if you could quickly say what your main expectations are of the new Biden administration's policy toward Native American people.\n\nALLIE YOUNG : Yeah. Well, we're definitely going to be making sure that we're represented, especially when it comes to climate change. We do want a seat at the table. We want to be in that conversation, because we have just incredible knowledge about the ways that we respect Mother Earth, that we honor Mother Earth, and those are things that will end up saving Mother Earth. And so, learning from us and collaborating with us, and also on issues of - we're still in COVID -19, and it's still severely impacting our tribal communities, so we're expected - we're expecting them to work with us in helping us to bring the funding and the aid that we need, because $8 billion was not enough in the initial stimulus package.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Navajo activist Allie Young, the founder of Protect the Sacred, and Jodi Archambault,  a citizen of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. She served as the former special assistant to President Obama for Native American affairs for the White House Domestic Policy Council.\n\nComing up, Juan González on how the corporate media got it wrong, missed the real story about Latinx voter turnout in the 2020 election.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "Sen. Tim Scott Wants To Sell Unity To The Party Of White Grievance. Good Luck With That.\n\nSen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) has not made up his mind on whether or not he will run for president, but he has recently launched a presidential exploratory committee , and based on his first week as a prospective candidate, already developed a losing strategy for a would-be bid.\n\nScott, the lone Black Republican member of the Senate, will reportedly tout the GOP as \"the great opportunity party.\"\n\n\"I will never back down in defense of the conservative values that make America exceptional,\" Scott said in a tweet accompanying his announcement video, adding, \"This fight is personal.\"\n\nHe also stressed to voters: \"The story of America is not defined by our original sin. The story of America is defined by our redemption.\"\n\nThe video was filmed at Fort Sumter near Charleston, South Carolina, where the state militia in 1861attacked federal troops and started the Civil War.\n\n\"America's soul was put to the test,\" Scott said. \"And we prevailed.\"\n\nWho is the \"we\" here? It's certainly not the white conservatives who gleefully wave that red flag of oppression. Nor is it the party itself, which actively stokes racial animus to win over voters, only to later use the power procured to enact policies that serve as bludgeons to the Black community.\n\nI'm sure such viewpoints make me sound like a \"radical leftist\" to the likes of Scott, who once stressed in a 2021 speech, \"America is not a racist country.\"\n\nOn the other hand, he boasted of his ability \"to disrupt the narrative of race\" in his announcement video, but what does that mean exactly?\n\nIn February, while speaking at the Charleston County GOP Black History Month Banquet, Scott noted : \"I'm not here to suggest that things could not get better, and I'm going to work every single day to make sure that all Americans play on a level playing field. That hasn't always been the case. But today is not 1865. Today is not 1923. We have made tremendous progress, and it's time that we as a people celebrate the progress we are making.\"\n\nSo, Scott's talent is that he can acknowledge the obvious ― racism is real ― but deny the active role his political party of choice plays in perpetuating systemic voters and win statewide office in a state like South Carolina.\n\nUh, good for him, I guess, but how is such a strategy going to win over GOP primary voters for a presidential campaign?\n\nLet Scott and his supporters tell it, he can indeed win over Republican primary voters with a more \"optimistic\" vision.\n\n\"The message is resonating,\" Scott told Th e N ew Yo rk Times while campaigning in Iowa late last week. That is not evident in any polling, which is why such proclamations obscure the political realities of the GOP and its base of voters.\n\nThere is hope among a few conservatives that someone will help the party \"move on\" from Trump, but as veteran Republican pollster Sarah Longwell explained in a piece for The Bulwark , based on all of the focus groups she's engaged in, GOP voters don't want anyone that reminds them of the Republican Party before Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\n\"By the time this campaign hits New Hampshire, everyone in America - even the conservative think tank donors - will understand that we aren't living through an interregnum, but rather have passed into a new age,\" Longwell said.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, a racist in the eyes of many for multiple reasons spanning decades, continues to have a commanding lead in all 2024 GOP primary voting ― and his argument as to why that is sounds far more reasonable than the one Scott is peddling.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump stood before Republican National Committee donors in Nashville to argue that he single-handedly \"saved\" the Republican Party from \"the establishment class\" when he won in 2016.\n\n\"Republicans were a party known for starting wars overseas, cutting Social Security and Medicare at home, and pushing mass amnesty for illegal aliens,\" Trump explained during the closed-door gathering at the Four Seasons Hotel per Politico .\n\nAnd what are they known for now?\n\nStill all of that, frankly, but more pronouncedly, their active antagonizing of marginalized groups and pursuit of restricting longstanding rights take more precedent these days.\n\nOff the heels of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis going after AP Black history courses, GOP representatives in other states like Louisiana are seeking to prevent the teaching of racism altogether ― on par with the other bigots of the party across the country that have been targeting libraries for featuring books that challenge their views on race, gender and sexuality over the last year.\n\nIt's all a natural evolution of the birther president's policy initiatives like the Muslim Ban, the racist rhetoric about \"shithole\" countries, and the explanation that there are \"very fine people\" on both sides of a debate about white supremacy and antisemitism.\n\nAnd after all of Trump's displays of varying displays of prejudice, corruption and contempt for democracy, the base continues to rally behind him, thus proving his assertion in that speech to rich donors that the \"old Republican Party is gone, and it is never coming back.\"\n\nTrump claimed in his nearly hour-long speech that he would make the GOP an \"unstoppable juggernaut that will dominate American politics for generations to come.\"\n\nImagine all of the people that would suffer under his rule ― to the cheers of his vengeful supporters and the party catering to them.\n\nTrump did not bring racism to the Republican Party, but his political ascension has given others the courage to once again be more forthright with their biases ― exactly why Trump leads over all his challengers with his discount version, the empty and cruel Ron DeSantis, at a distant second.\n\nTrump will more than likely be the nominee, and he is not selling a second term themed around hope and optimism, but one of \"retribution.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Racial Politics and the Non-White Vassals of White Politicians\n\nExecutive Director, New York Civil Rights Coalition\n\nI am cussin' every time I turn on the TV and hear liberal pundits accuse the GOP Presidential candidates of outright racism and of the use of racial code words. It's as if we're existing in a pre-civil rights revolution time warp instead of the 21st century where race in America ain't what it used to be.\n\nThe charges of racism are interspersed with accusations of class warfare inasmuch as Mitt Romney, the pundits say, admitted to being unconcerned with the very poor, they who have a safety net, according to Romney. Conservatives, too, bandy about bold allegations of class warfare, when they criticize President Barack Obama 's campaign rhetoric, accusations which the liberal pundits cite as further examples of race-baiting by white conservatives against America's first African-American president.\n\nSay what?\n\nWhen it comes to racial paranoia MSNBC is in a bizarro world of its own. Andrea Mitchell, among others, decried Newt Gingrich's racial overtones as \"dog whistles\" aimed at white voters. Chris Matthews piped in, accusing The Newt of the racially charged use of \"Juan\" when Gingrich answered a question from journalist Juan Williams during the South Carolina debate. And MSNBC star host Rachel Maddow inveighed that Gingrich, when he chastised Obama as \"Entertainer-in-Chief -- for Obama's having crooned at the Apollo Theater--was depicting Obama as a minstrel; she said Gingrich's criticism was sheer race-baiting, an example of Gingrich's \"calling out to minstrelsy.\"\n\nObama as minstrel.\n\nObama as shirker.\n\nObama as incompetent -- these are, to the liberal pundits, all racial code words -- examples of GOPers vying for his job engaging in modern-day racism.\n\nIt's as if every critical word of Barack Obama is to be dissected for proof that the GOP candidates running for President are crude or subtle racists; and their non-white backers and party members are castigated as mere vassals of the white power structure, and as traitors to their race. The harshest calumny has been aimed at GOP Congressman Allen West; but Herman Cain, Ron Christie, and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley have been ripped too by malicious name-calling based on their race and their political persuasion. The noisy whisper is, \"How can any self-respecting black, Latino or Asian front for this crop of Republicans who are so hostile to civil rights and who use racial coda to appeal to an angry white electorate?\"\n\nI am a civil rights specialist and I know something about racism -- in its overt and subtle forms -- and many guises. But I am still waiting for hard evidence that Newt Gingrich, Mitt Romney, Ron Paul, and Rick Santorum are running a Southern strategy for the White House prize -- seeking and intending to divide the electorate along racial lines, passions and fears. Yes, yes, yes, I know, the \"historian\" Gingrich has accused President Obama of being the \"food stamps president,\" but that was a laughable moment, not racial coda. Everybody knows, except the \"historian\" Gingrich, that LBJ was our \"food stamps president.\" It was Johnson, the former segregationist, who established the federal food stamp program as a response to a national hunger and malnutrition crisis. In fact, as everyone knows, most Americans on food stamps are whites, not blacks.\n\nStill, the pundits at MSNBC assure me that Gingrich is race-baiting when he calls Obama \"the food stamps president,\" and that Romney, the patrician, is out of touch with black and poor folks because he is, after all, a very wealthy man. But wasn't also JFK, and Nelson Rockefeller, and FDR? Wealth alone is not the litmus test for being \"out of touch.\" Nor is double speak, constant compromise, or pretense at caring for the downtrodden sure signs of progressive politics.\n\nAnd what about this charge of minstrelsy? More than black politicians have been singing for votes. He was off-key, but we all heard Mitt Romney sing \"America The Beautiful.\" And Herman Cain, until his voice grew hoarse from denying sexual harassment allegations sang gospel. \"Amazing Grace\" made a comeback as an American standard more than a few times when Cain took the stage. I saw none of this singing as racial much less the criticism of it as racial coda, no more than I interpreted the many charges harassment charges against Cain, from white and black women, as \"racist.\"\n\nObama, as a \"minstrel,\" is MSNBC's invention.\n\nNow, I know that racists, racial buffoons, and race hustlers come in many shapes and guises, but I need firmer evidence that the current field of GOP candidates -- backed up by their non-white supporters -- are running the old race game on us. Yet the only thing MSNBC keeps putting in our face and harping on is their bottom line, seemingly, that a black man who is president can't get no respect.\n\nOf course, I know that we have not yet stamped out racism completely in America. That is exactly why it is so important not to trivialize racism by calling things racist that they are not. False accusations repeated again and again do not make a truth. Liberals should know better than to keep crying racism, falsely. because we need everyone on board and everyone's attention when we spot and fight real outbreaks of racism and skin color discrimination.\n\nI just don't fancy Newt Gingrich -- he's wrong, wrong, wrong -- and block-headed and intemperate on so many issues. His meanness turns me cold -- but isn't that enough of a criticism of him? Do we need go \"there\" -- that is, conjure up that he is being racist whe he is talking plainly and acerbically?\n\nIf the insinuations and outright accusations of GOP racism are real -- that the GOPers seeking to evict the first African-American President from the Oval Office are racist, and they are trying to return America to its antebellum period of race relations, then why haven't the journalists at MSNBC asked a single salient question of the \"historian\" Newt Gingrich, and of Ron Paul, and the others, about race prejudice and discrimination in America? Such a question is not about food stamps. The genuine article of a question -- which should have been asked in South Carolina -- on the night of Martin L. King, Jr.'s birthday -- is this: \"What would you have advised President Eisenhower to do with the Supreme Court's unanimous decision to outlaw public school segregation -- a decision that overruled many Southerners' concept of states' rights? Would you have urged President Ike to ignore the decision? Would you have had the nine justices hauled before the Congress to explain themselves? In your vision of federalism, is the federal law and the Constitution the supreme law of the land, which trumps claims of states' rights, those who said states had a right to deny persons because of their skin color equal protection under the law?\"\n\nNewt Gingrich's reply to such a real question would have been telling; he would have, I suspect, had to backtrack on his absurd declaration of war on the federal judiciary. Even Ron Paul, who laments the 1964 Civil Rights Act, would not today urge its repeal. That's because they know America is finished with racial segregation of old. We can't go backwards on race relations and fundamental civil rights protections -- and every candidate, white and black, who wants to get elected, knows that.\n\nWe're a lot more advanced on the race question than the MSNBC pundits give us viewers and Americans credit for.\n\nIt's also sad that MSNBC's pundits don't yet get that not every white conservative is a racist at heart and that not every black or non-white looks or thinks alike. There are some non-whites who side with Romney; others (including youths) who salute Ron Paul; and some who say amen to Rick Santorum's candidacy. Likewise, Gingrich is drawing support from those citizens and immigrants who think like Gingrich has the right idea about not deporting the undocumented. These GOPers and independents are of different faiths, various skin colors, and ethnicity.. They include Herman Cain, who backs Gingrich, and Nikki Haley, who backs Romney, and the youths who back Ron Paul. They do not think of themselves as turning back the clock on civil rights because of their political views and personal choices. The suggestion that they are either modern-day \"racists\" or enablers of turning us back to our discredited racial past is sheer racial rhetoric and poppycock.\n\nThe GOPers plainly and simply have a different view of things than most of us liberal Democrats. But even I can understand their frustration with big government, high taxation, and the broken promises of the DC establishment. They, and I, are beet red angry. We want things to change for the better. We long for JFK's rising tide lifts all boats. But if that adage still holds, we haven't seen or felt that as yet. Hence, that is why we do see a rising chorus of minorities who are criticizing Obama, the incumbent, and who are breaking party ranks, and joining forces with others, black and white, also are fed up with government as we have known it. And they too also recoil at the rehtoric of Herman Cain about how blacks are on the Democratic Party plantation. That's utter nonsense and he knew it when he uttered that hyperbole. People don't want to be labeled black or white or as \"vassal\" or \"slave master;\" that's old-hat now as well as rancorous racial bluster.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Labeling blacks and Latinos and Asians who support the party of Lincoln \"today's Uncle Toms\" does not advance us one whit.\n\nI strongly disagree with Congressman Allen West, ex-businessman Herman Cain, Senator Marco Rubio, and SC Governor Nikki Haley, but they're entitled to their viewpoint and their choice of Presidential candidate and political party without being written off as traitors to their race and people.\n\nThose more certain about the manifestations of racism than me -- such as the MSNBC pundits -- may think they know better than me and the rest of us who is and who isn't \"authentic\" and who is and is not black or Latino or Asian. But I regard the rage of white liberals at MSNBC over the skin color of those who back limited government, low taxation, and who back GOPers over Obama, as singularly regressive, contrived and mischievous. Just because a man shares my skin color -- or doesn't -- tells me no more than that; skin color in America today is not a proxy for anything solid and meaningful by way of prediction or evaluation of efforts. That's what Dr. King struggled to achieve; and that's what we have accomplished-in our victories over racial prejudice -- the right of blacks and all who constitute racial minorities to be treated and regarded as individuals.\n\nLet's all take a deep breath and acknowledge: We have come a mighty long way as a nation in turning the corner on \"race.\" As we evaluate President Obama, and his GOP rivals -- let's ask ourselves -- What does the candidate's race really have to do with anything? MSNBC's pundits may posit otherwise, but what do they really know about race?\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "4 Ways White Political Forces Steal Elections and How We Can Stop It\n\nChristian leader for social change; President and Founder @Sojourners\n\nA personal tweet I sent out this week said : \"Let's be clear -- and Christian: A vote for Donald Trump is a vote for racism.\"\n\nIn one of the many postmortem discussions on Tuesday's primary results, Cokie Roberts on Morning Joe said we were leaving race out of the questions we're asking. She's right. Donald Trump's success isn't just because of his entertaining flamboyance, his marketing brand, his experienced self-promotion, his business boasting, and his other fabricated \"outsider\" identities that appeal to people who genuinely feel outside of American politics and life. At its core, Donald Trump's campaign is about race -- which is why this is about far more than politics and partisanship for many of us religious leaders. When Roberts asked Trump if he was proud of the growing reports about white schoolchildren verbally attacking students of color and telling them they will soon have a wall built against them to keep them out of America, Trump reacted by saying it was a \"nasty\" question. No, it was one of the few good questions from journalists that morning.\n\nDonald Trump is the race candidate, projecting white nationalism and xenophobia, appealing to fear and resentment, and always blaming people of other races for the problems of low-income white people. There is a long history of that in the United States, recently exemplified again by the KKK and other white supremacists coming into the electoral conversation and Trump's unwillingness to be quick and clear about his rejection of racial politics.\n\nThe pundits say working class Republicans are in revolt against the Republican establishment, which makes sense as those elites are ones who have supported and benefitted from rigged market forces and globalization that have turned all our economic rewards to the top 1 percent while abandoning working and middle class people. Bernie Sanders is getting many of those angry white votes, too, in the Democratic primaries. But Sanders doesn't blame \"the others\" as Trump does; he instead focuses on the richest institutions and people in America who have managed all this -- the same ones Trump loves to brag about being part of with his ostentatious lifestyle. (How many press conferences have you seen with the candidate's expensive wines and steaks on display while he proudly lists all of his properties? Is this really happening in America?) There is also a long history of uniting working people from all races against the forces that would both ignore and divide them. One kind of populism tries to divide those who have been marginalized; the other kind tries to bring them together.\n\nDonald Trump is clearly appealing to our worst instincts, as many have said, but let's be more clear: Donald Trump is appealing to the worst instincts of white people, and American history has shown how ugly and violent those white instincts can be. He is right when he claims to be bringing out people that have never voted before -- but he leaves out that those new voters are angry white people.\n\nAt the same time we're adding them to our voting rolls, there are active political forces directly engaged in trying to block and diminish the turnout of black, Hispanic, Asian, and Muslim voters. They're doing so in four ways.\n\nFirst, as Michelle Alexander explains in The New Jim Crow , political strategies now connect the deliberate mass incarceration of black and brown men and women with the subsequent and purposeful political disenfranchisement of those millions of people of color when they return to society.\n\nSecond, deliberate gerrymandering and misshaping of voting districts creates and protects white voting blocs and puts minorities together so as to not challenge those white majority blocs. After sweeping victories in 2010, newly elected Republicans in state legislatures and governors' mansions across the country took full advantage of Census-based redistricting to gerrymander in favor of white conservatives.\n\nThird, the passage of a slew of new voting rules and regulations enacted since 2010 are again deliberate attempts to reduce the votes of minorities and young people in what Rev. William Barber calls \" the second career of 'James Crow, Esq. '\" In other words, after the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts of the 1960s dismantled the overt Jim Crow laws that enforced segregation and denied African Americans many basic rights, Jim Crow went to law school, became the more respectable \"James Crow, Esq.,\" and devised more sophisticated and insidious ways to disenfranchise people of color. The historic election of 2008 brought an unprecedented number of young people and people of color to the polls. The white conservative backlash came in the 2010 mid-term elections. As Myrna Pérez explains in Sojourners magazine:\n\nSince the 2010 election, 21 states have instituted new voting restrictions--the biggest rollback of the right to vote since the Jim Crow era. This year will be the first presidential election with many of these new barriers in place, from requiring photo identification (which millions of Americans do not have) to curtailing early voting (which many citizens depend on to cast their ballots). On top of this, voters will go to the polls in November with the fewest federal protections against racial discrimination in half a century, due to a 2013 Supreme Court decision gutting a key provision of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nFourth, there are efforts to bring new white voters to the polls who are angry and resentful of America's growing racial diversity -- basically, Trump's constituency.\n\nSojourners has just released an important new video detailing some of these efforts at voter suppression across the country, and also lifts up some positive efforts to expand access to voting in some states. I encourage you to watch this video to get an even better sense of what is at stake for our democracy this year. Then share it with others.\n\nHow Stealing Elections Became Legal\n\n#SuperTuesday voting, yay! BUT did you know we're in the midst of the biggest rollback to voting rights since Jim Crow?? Find out more: http://bit.ly/1QquxC6\n\nPosted by Sojourners on Tuesday, March 1, 2016\n\nSo here is an election strategy for people of faith from all races, for people of moral conscience in both parties who are against racist policies and practices, for everyone who believes that every American should have the right and greatest opportunity to vote, and for those who believe that access is absolutely essential to the future of our democracy. This should be a moral issue, not a partisan one.\n\nIt is time for a new and powerful alliance between the faith community, white voters against racism, and democracy advocates of all political stripes to unite together to register as many racial minorities and young people as possible to vote -- with the best efforts being led by leaders and organizations of color -- and then to mobilize the best possible access to voting on Election Day for everyone. Perhaps it's time for clergy to show up on Election Day in polling places to help support and secure the votes of those minority voters who are under attack.\n\nThese are some moral marching orders for election 2016. We have about 8 months to do them.\n\nJim Wallis is president of Sojourners.

      "text": "Alex Jones' 'Free Speech' Shouldn't Be Your Primary Concern\n\nGuest Writer\n\nAfter Apple, YouTube, Facebook and other companies removed or banned some of Alex Jones ' and Infowars content this week, both conservatives and many well-meaning progressives popped up to say that allowing these companies to define certain speech as hateful or unacceptable is a dangerous precedent and a potentially slippery slope. As private companies, these platforms have no legal obligation to give Jones a platform. Yet if we value freedom of speech as a broader value in our society, these claims are not without their merits. We have seen these platforms use their terms of service or community guidelines to stifle discourse and minimize the ability of people to organize and engage around pertinent issues.\n\nHowever - and I can't say this strongly enough - Jones is not the hill any free speech advocate should want to die on.\n\nIn a purely academic conversation, protecting free speech regardless of content seems to make sense. But free speech absolutism ignores the fact that, in reality, speech is not supported equally across all topics and platforms for everyone. This lens fails to consider the actual power dynamics at play and how society works in favor and support of those who uphold white supremacy and white fragility.\n\nOften free speech concerns arise, as with Jones, in the context of those who want the freedom to express viewpoints that are not merely odious or unpopular but are also directly tied to the dehumanization and subjugation of others.\n\nThrough his lawyer, Jones has argued that he is a \" performance artist \" simply playing a character for money. He spends time selling random products and \" supplements \" in addition to spewing crazy theories and lies . He has victimized immigrants, Muslims and black Americans with conspiracy theories and misinformation, often stoking his followers to harass his targets online and in real life . Most famously, Jones is being sued for defamation by parents of a child killed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The parents have had to move repeatedly because of him, and his lawyer is still trying to publicly reveal personal information about them, including their addresses. Up to now, the tech platforms said there was nothing they could do to stop him.\n\n\"We have consistently seen the highest premium placed on protecting freedom of speech only when the speaker is white and conservative.\"\n\nMeanwhile, we have seen numerous instances of progressive activists suspended or banned from these sites for far less than Jones is guilty of. Right-wing trolls have figured out that they can cynically exploit the regulation - or lack thereof - of these platforms to harass and silence minority viewpoints. Apparently, Twitter doesn't consider hate speech to be harassment or a violation of its terms of service. How many times on Twitter have you seen people pleading with @Jack to reinstate the accounts of individuals who were merely defending themselves from targeted harassment?\n\nWhen ProPublica reported that Facebook 's internal guidelines protected white males more than any other group, it reaffirmed the experiences of many on the platform, as well as those on Twitter, who had been suspended for commentary that addressed valid issues but were viewed as targeting white people or as hate speech itself. Last summer, activist and writer Ijeoma Oluo was attacked on Twitter and Facebook over her tweets and posts detailing a racist incident while on a road trip with her children. Instead of addressing those attacking Oluo, Twitter and Facebook took action against her instead. Independent media actors, activists and even casual users who reflect on structural inequities and engage in dismantling systemic oppressions have often been met with labeling, censorship and constraints on our expression. And because these companies fear endless accusations of anti-conservative bias, we have consistently seen the highest premium placed on protecting freedom of speech only when the speaker is white and conservative. In those cases, the harassment and civil rights abuses that are rampant across these platforms and are the natural result of these decisions are of secondary concern.\n\nCommentators spill endless ink on protests against white conservatives on college campuses but raise no concerns about the harassment of journalists or death threats to progressive academics. This notion that we have to hear and defend all ideas to ensure the rights of others without any concern for the harms being done to marginalized communities is stupid.\n\nAddressing this issue in the context of clashes between the \"alt-right\" and anti-fascist protesters in Berkeley, California, last year, Meleiza Figueroa wrote in The Nation , \"This battle is emphatically not about free speech. This is about the ability to shape consensus in a time of rising mass anxiety and political extremism. The 'power of framing,' as linguist George Lakoff puts it, is everything.\"\n\nWriter and activist Devyn Springer further explained it in Medium last year:\n\nColor-blind, non-contextual or language-specific approaches to social media censoring by corporations like Twitter allows for the same consequential racial disparity. By perpetuating absolutist notions of free speech, it inherently positions hate speech by white supremacists as equal to or extremely similar to the speech and actions of marginalized communities. Whereas one might be inclined to see online censorship as separate from the laws and policies of real-life interactions, we must begin to see the ways they feed off of one another and create a persistent silencing of marginalized voices.\n\nSpringer argued that we need to shift beyond this purely academic discourse of absolute free speech and look at the real material conditions that end up reinforcing the status quo ― a status quo that disproportionately regulates and limits the actions of marginalized communities.\n\nConsidering how crucial social media platforms have become as alternative sources of building power and information, we cannot ignore how these entities determine who is permitted access. It is unsurprising that Twitter has decided to let Jones have a refuge on its platform. The site is perhaps the worst example of enabling the targeted harassment of vulnerable people while banning others for far lesser infractions. When pressured to actually do something about the hatred on the site, Jack Dorsey and his company have so far come up empty.\n\n\"It is unsurprising that Twitter has decided to let Jones have a refuge on its platform.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

There is no value in this brand of free speech advocacy that will fight tooth and nail on principal for the unprincipled but stay silent about issues of platform and access that effectively deny equitable free speech to marginalized communities.\n\nThe protests over Jones' banning aren't about freedom of speech and making sure everyone has a say. This is about maintaining and sustaining white supremacy and power. This is about Jones and his ability to earn ridiculous amounts of money peddling falsehoods, inflaming hatred and selling junk. There is no absolute right to be a hateful grifter without accountability.\n\nJones and his ilk have built a media empire solely focused on maximizing wealth and opportunity without regard for the impact on society and marginalized communities. Those defending him disregard the attacks that have taken place against independent progressive voices and platforms.\n\nDefending Alex Jones' right to exist on commercial platforms is about protecting white fragility and a mediocre extreme. It has nothing to do with supporting the masses and our freedoms that may be compromised. Anoa Changa is an activist and attorney in Atlanta.

      "text": "The 2016 GOP Convention: The Whitest Of The Whitest Conventions\n\nEarl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst\n\nCalling the 2016 GOP convention the whitest of the whitest GOP conventions is not redundancy or a play on words. It underscores the fact that this convention, in comparison to the 2012 GOP convention and indeed a string of other GOP conventions going back in recent time, have been virtually lily white affairs. Start with the 2012 convention. Much was made before the start of that convention that former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former Democratic Congressman Arthur Davis and Saratoga Springs, Utah Mayor Mia Love would be among the bevy of speakers at the convention. Much was also made that New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez, and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley would also be prominent on the speaker's dais. This supposedly was the GOP's public rebuke to the loud charge that it was yet another good ole' white guys confab. The charge was more than a charge it was a brutal fact. Blacks and Hispanics were the proverbial invisible persons at the convention. African-Americans made up a paltry two percent of the delegates, and Hispanics only a slightly higher number. It wasn't much better four years earlier in 2008. Only 36 of the more than 2,300 delegates to that convention were black. The GOP by its lowest of low minority delegate bar looked positively like a minority's champion in 2004 when the number of black delegates soared to a towering 167 number at that convention.\n\nhttp://racerelations.about.com/od/organizations/a/The-Gop-S-Diversity-Problem.htm\n\nThe 2016 convention may well plumb even deeper the depths in the number of minorities there. The tip-off is who is on the list of the dozens of speakers announced. More than 80 percent of those who will take the podium are white, mostly white males.\n\nThe chronic invisibility of minority, especially African-American speakers and delegates, at this year's GOP convention is chalked up to Trump. That is his racially incendiary, immigrant, Hispanic and especially Muslim bashing campaign and rhetoric that got him to the top of the GOP presidential heap. This was on glaring and embarrassing display when one poll found that Trump got all of one percent of black voter support. Embarrassing because even Reagan and George W. Bush got about six percent of the black vote, and other GOP presidential candidate like Reagan and Bush no matter how conservative their credentials get around that percentage of the black vote.\n\nThe paltry number of blacks and Hispanics that turn up at the GOP conventions is much more than just a reflection of a GOP presidential candidate, Trump, who has run a virtual one-man hit campaign against minorities. And who has not so subtly aimed his hard pitch at frustrated, fearful, and angry whites, and worse unreconstructed bigots. It's a continued hard indictment of the party that shoved him to the top. That's on naked display in the Trump influenced 2016 GOP platform that calls for a tough crackdown on illegal immigrants, and comes dangerously close to endorsing Trump's call for a border wall.\n\nTrump, however, merely swims in the party's longstanding, rancid, racially charged history and philosophy. The GOP is a party that promotes unabashed racially sneaky code words, a Southern Strategy and state's rights. It would not be the political force it is in state and especially national politics, and would not maintain its firm support base in the Deep South and the Heartland states among white rural, suburban, conservative blue collar and male voters, if it wavered in defending its core racial turf. Even the few high profile black Republicans , such as Clarence Thomas, adhere to and fervently espouse the party's hardline conservative attack points.\n\nThere is absolutely no room for them to deviate from them. Former GOP Republican National Chairman Michael Steele had a momentary inkling that simply having black faces spout the stock conservative line would never attract more than a bare handful of blacks to the GOP. On occasion he quipped that the GOP had to give blacks some reason to embrace the GOP. But Steele even as he said that Steele was already well on his way to becoming a casualty of the GOP's steady march backward to its extreme right-wing stance on the issues. He was soon ousted.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Trump's virtually lily white key staffers, his selection of ultra-conservative Mike Pence as his VP running mate, and his raucous rallies before mostly white audiences were further glaring signs that the GOP convention would be a convention where minorities would be largely missing from sight.\n\nThe 2016 GOP platform reflects much of the Tea Party agenda. The staples again are: repeal the Affordable Care Act, slash government spending, downsize the federal employment, gut federal regulations on environment protection and laxly check on financial and corporate abuse. The convention platform is designed to rouse the GOP's conservative legions and will wreak even more misery on minorities. The 2016 GOP convention again delivers on what the GOP has worked overtime for years to be and that's the whitest of whitest conventions.\n\nEarl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

      "text": "Conservatives Aren't Really Concerned About The Supreme Court Nominee's Qualifications\n\nNo one who's the \"first\" Black person to do something has an easy story.\n\nJackie Robinson faced immense intimidation and the spittle of racists. Barack Obama started getting death threats before he was even the Democratic nominee for president. Ruby Bridges, a child, was protested against, threatened and spat on for trying to go to school.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, it won't be much different for the first Black woman to be nominated for the U.S. Supreme Court . She won't be able to take her historic spot in the country's highest court without America's premiere racists dusting off their usual playbook.\n\nThough Ketanji Brown Jackson went to Harvard and Harvard Law, served as a federal public defender, clerked for Justice Stephen Breyer and is currently a federal judge, white conservatives are still throwing adult temper tantrums over her qualifications.\n\nWhen Breyer announced his plan to retire and Biden reiterated his campaign promise to nominate a Black woman for the Supreme Court, the rumblings began. The idea was that Biden was going to pick someone whose only qualification was their identity.\n\n\"If you're a white guy, tough luck. If you're a white woman, tough luck. You don't qualify,\" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said .\n\nOut of 115 judges who have served on the Supreme Court since 1789, only five have been women and only three have been people of color .\n\nYet you hardly hear anyone questioning the qualifications of the 110 white people appointed to the Supreme Court. And it's not because they happened to have more experience. In fact, Judge Jackson's qualifications surpass some of the current judges on the bench.\n\n\"She has more experience as a judge than four of the people who are already on the Supreme Court, not that we're keeping track.\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said this week.\n\nIt's not really about her credentials, of course. After all, Amy Coney Barrett had way less experience , and Brett Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assault . So, instead of simply saying that they don't believe Jackson should be confirmed because she's a Black woman, they're pretending what they say has some merit.\n\nIt's unclear who the dog whistles are for. Their leader, former President Donald Trump, traded the whistle for a bullhorn several years ago; it seemed we were beyond dressing raw racism in coded terms.\n\nBut alas, Fox News' Tucker Carlson - who never misses an opportunity to be racist - began harping on LSAT score this week, all while mispronouncing her name.\n\n\"Wonder how she did on the LSATs? Why won't he tell us that? That would settle the question conclusively as to whether she is a once-in-a-generational legal talent, the next Learned Hand,\" he said .\n\nFor the uninitiated, LSAT is the entrance exam for law school. I am no expert, but it's probably safe to say that her score was decent - she attended Harvard. But also, her LSAT score is completely irrelevant.\n\nNot only would Jackson be the first Black woman on the Supreme Court, she'd also be the first public defender. These types of lawyers represent the people who cannot afford a private lawyer, which is the vast majority of people charged with crimes in this country. Her background serving the public gives her an advantage in seeing some of the messier parts of the criminal justice system.\n\nBut this is not a qualification to conservatives.\n\nAs some cities and states deal with a rise in violent crime, which began in 2019, Republicans are taking the opportunity to revive \"soft on crime\" attacks. And who better to blame than a Black person?\n\n\"The Senate must conduct a rigorous, exhaustive review of Judge Jackson's nomination to the Supreme Court,\" Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) tweeted last month . \"This is especially crucial as American families face major crises that connect directly to our legal system, such as skyrocketing violent crime and open borders.\"\n\nThere goes that dog whistle again.\n\nHe elaborated in a longer statement this week. \"This is a moment when issues relating to the law and the judiciary are directly hitting American families - from skyrocketing murders and carjackings; to soft-on-crime prosecutors effectively repealing laws; to open borders,\" Sen. McConnell said . He also implied that Judge Jackson is a left-wing radical supported by \"fringe\" groups - liberals who want to expand the Supreme Court.\n\n\"It's a matter of record that this nominee was the anointed favorite of these fringe groups.... So I intend to explore why groups that are waging political war against the Court as an institution decided Judge Jackson was their special favorite.\"\n\nBut there's no indication that the judge's legal opinions are anything but mainstream liberal politics.\n\nThe GOP's attacks on an obviously qualified judge are another reminder that respectability politics are a useless framework. Judge Jackson has two degrees from Harvard and is still being accused of not having the credentials to be a Supreme Court judge. It's almost as if none of this is about who has the qualifications but rather who the right thinks deserves to hold power.\n\nOne might think that Republicans simply aren't in the mood to wage an all-out war against Jackson. After all, her appointment won't tip the balance of the conservative court, and there are more pressing matters, like the midterm elections this fall, to think about.\n\nSo why are conservatives looking for ways to discredit Judge Jackson? Why do Republicans trot out the same tired attacks anytime a person of color is poised to break a glass ceiling?\n\nConservatism, at least in the United States, is repulsed by a multiracial democracy and Black equality. So the answer is simple. They are morally opposed to the thought of a Black woman in power.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Dear Conservatives, Let's Not Ruin 2015 Like We Ruined 2014\n\nEditor, A Plus\n\nDuring the last year, I have spent an unhealthy and inordinate amount of time arguing about politics, race and sports on my social networks.\n\nMany of my friends have begged me to stop, pleading through text messages or private messages or email, imploring me to understand that talking about serious issues on Facebook will never do any good. And they may be right.\n\nBut what I've found on the Internet this last year is what has been supported by a frightening Pew Research study : our country is more divided now, across partisan lines, than it has been in a long time. And that division is creating a hatred for fellow Americans, a hatred for people that don't share your political views, that is nearly unprecedented.\n\nWhat I've come to find true, more than any other thing I've learned from interacting with this other side, is that we have to start working together. We have to start talking to each other, fleshing out meaning from our words, investigating our motives, working together to keep the powers over us in check. It seems so obvious when you say it, but we have to start doing it and doing it honestly. Facebook and Twitter are great tools for these kinds of conversations, enabling us to communicate our ideas and feelings with people we know, people we've never met, and people from all over the country. If we do it responsibly, and honestly, the effect could be tremendous.\n\nSo when I say \"Dear conservatives, let's not ruin 2015,\" I mean it quite literally: let us, liberals and conservatives, not ruin it like we did 2014.\n\nHere is my effort at turning over a new leaf of honesty in the new year, and my plea with both my \"conservative\" and my \"liberal\" brethren to be more honest with each other and ourselves. Liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans , centrists and libertarians, independents and people who claim they hate politics, we're all in it together and we're all responsible for our country's actions -- whether we voted for those actions or not.\n\nFirstly, and most importantly, we need to be better at digesting our news. Liberals need to stop worshiping Jon Stewart and start voting. I love The Daily Show, and I'll watch it until it's off the air, but how about listening to Stewart when he tells us not to use his show as a news source, 'K? It's on Comedy Central for a reason.\n\nLibs should also stop screaming and start talking, and quit trying to inherit the struggles of others. Yes, empathy is important. But using your understanding of the struggles of others, particularly people of color, to advance some kind of sympathy for yourself is a short-sighted and slimy thing to do. It just shows your privilege. (Also, conservatives can try grasping the simple concept of privilege in 2015.)\n\nWhile we're at it, conservatives need to find another news source that isn't Fox News . Liberals can stop drooling over MSNBC (which misinforms its viewers just as frequently). Or, as a more general rule, we should all start reading our news instead of watching it. Television is a great way to track breaking news, or to watch incredible footage, but it's also designed to keep you watching and to keep you scared (even if that means keeping you misinformed). If you want real news, or real understanding, you're going to have to read to get it.\n\nHere is a good guide:\n\nWe need to be optimistic about the economy, for the sake of the economy. There is no doubt things were bad when President Obama took office. For many people, including the African-American community, things have gotten worse or stayed the same . But all news about the economy isn't bad, and both conservatives and liberals need to accept the hard truth that your bank account not growing doesn't mean the country's economy isn't improving. As Steve Benen writes on MSNBC.com, \"Economic growth is at an 11-year high. Job growth is at a 15-year high. The stock market is soaring. Wages are rising. Gas prices are plummeting. American manufacturing is improving. The uninsured rate is dropping.\" We can no longer greet that news with silence.\n\nWe need to start being real about our women and men in uniform. That means not acting like every soldier joined the armed forces to kill, or believing every cop gets a high from arresting a person of color. Speaking of uniforms, it also means accepting that the families of people wearing police uniforms are more likely to suffer from domestic abuse than families of people wearing NFL uniforms. It means understanding that many of the men and women who take a gun to their day job, just like many of our country's immigrants who work low-wage, hard labor positions, are probably doing a job you wouldn't want to do yourself. So be grateful for them. Part of that gratitude means caring about the repercussions of their service , and knowing when to shy away from blind hero worship. Like lawyers, doctors, celebrities and athletes, men and women in uniform are fallible the same way we all are. And, like the rest of us, sometimes they are scrutinized unjustly and sometimes they operate with impunity.\n\n\"[U]ntil the color of a man's skin is of no more significance than the color of his eyes.\" White conservatives need to stop telling people of color that the color of their skin doesn't make them more susceptible to police violence, to profiling or to a general negative assumption about their character, especially if you've never been a person of color (read: all white people), and especially not when as recently as 2012 a majority of Americans still held \" explicitly anti-black attitudes .\" White liberals need to stop acting like their race issues are becoming worse, when many of the statistics show it is only getting better . The fact that 53% of Americans believe race relations have gotten worse since Obama took office is more a product of click-worthy headlines and sensationalist television news than the day-to-day experience for many. While we may not \"agree\" about race across partisan lines, we (shockingly) do agree on some solutions . We also need to avoid the illusion that having a black president is some kind of progress for people of color. As Chris Rock so aptly put it (by the way, conservatives need to stop quoting Chris Rock about black-on-black crime), \"To say Obama is progress is saying that he's the first black person that is qualified to be president. That is not black progress. That's white progress. There's been black people qualified to be president for hundreds of years.\"\n\nWe need to stop being so scared of guns. Dear liberals, just because someone owns a gun doesn't mean they want to use it, hate gays, love Jesus or are anti-marijuana-legalization. Dear conservatives, just because we \"have the right to bear arms\" doesn't mean you should have a gun, or that guns are good for the country. Liberals need to stop acting like the majority of Americans are against gun ownership when they aren't . Conservatives need to stop acting like high rates of gun ownership can't be directly linked to the horribly tragic number of gun deaths when it can . As a whole, let's accept the fact that far more people are dying in mass shootings in our country than anywhere else. The issue cannot be ignored any longer, and whether we need to reform our gun laws or work on the mental health of our country (presumably both), we need to do it quickly, in an informed manner and together.\n\nWe need to stop acting like Republicans don't care about the poor. As has been widely reported and studied, the \"inconvenient truth\" for liberals is that Republicans are actually more charitable , and it isn't because they have more money. The motivations for being a giver vary drastically between liberals and conservatives, which is also an important conversation. But the bottom line is that when it comes to caring about the poor, going about it differently doesn't give liberals the right to act like they are somehow better. The belief that wanting to give health care to the uninsured is a more effective way to help poor people than, say, the countless religious organizations that raise money and do community outreach is unfounded. The Bible Belt could teach the rest of us a lesson about how to be better givers.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

I apologize for the candor, but this one is mainly directed at some maniacal Republican congressmen and congresswomen and the Fox News hosts who feed the beast. Here are four things that you've probably heard about, spent time worrying about, or had to argue about during Thanksgiving dinner: planes disappearing, Ebola, Benghazi, and the IRS. Unfortunately for Fox News, CNN , MSNBC and the like, flying in 2014 was the safest year thus far in the 21st century. I know that doesn't get ratings, but it might be worth including in the endless coverage of these admittedly fascinating plane disappearances. Ebola fear was a fad produced by your cable news networks and has quickly passed. Despite the fact that Fox News is (still?!) calling for the GOP to tackle the Benghazi and IRS \"scandals,\" after years of Republican-led investigation, both the Benghazi and IRS-imposing-sanctions-on-Republicans myths have been debunked.\n\nWe need to remember that, quite literally, we're all in this together. The 1% and the 99% is not some anarchist or liberal ideal. Our country's wealth, its health and the politicians on the ballot you vote for are all at the whim of a small group of wealthy elites who seldom have your interests in mind. Part of this truth is because such a shockingly low number of Americans exercise their right to vote. Part of it is because, in politics, money is power. This truth is so evident that I can't decide how to link it, so I'll leave it to you to do the research yourself. It's a liberal myth that these big money-grabbing politicians are always Republican; the truth is almost all of our most powerful politicians are bought and paid for.\n\nAs the dawn of 2015 approaches, let's all keep in mind that the men and women of our country, the Jesus lovers and the Muslims, the cops and the criminals, the blacks and the whites, the Republicans and the Democrats, the children and the elderly, and the 10,958 Americans born every day need each other. We need to stick together, to work together, to look out for each other, to keep each other safe and to lend a helping hand when we're capable. Sometimes I wish we could all act with the unity, the same regard for the people around you, as we did in the days following September 11th (with the exception, of course, of the rabid Islamaphobia). And if we could do that in the New Year, without a devastating tragedy forcing us together, we'd be off to a great start in 2015.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "About That Racist Email Your Grandmother Got...\n\nA writer who lives in Los Angeles\n\nSometimes in a relationship, usually a not-so-great one, one person refuses to acknowledge yet another flaw or mistake because the other person refuses to acknowledge any. That is where we are with race in America today, particularly relations between black people and white people.\n\nYesterday, my soon-to-be grandmother-in-law was singing the praises of Peggy Hubbard, a black woman from Belleville, Illinois who appeared on Sean Hannity last week to castigate the Black Lives Matter movement for highlighting police brutality while basically ignoring black-on-black crime. My soon-to-be grandmother in-law received an email about Peggy. She had never heard a black person criticize the black community before, and wondered why so many black folks choose to focus on police brutality rather than the soaring murder rate in Chicago that is overwhelmingly the result black-on-black crime. She seemed to have missed the comments of Barack Obama , Al Sharpton, Don Lemon, Jesse Jackson, not to mention black conservatives everywhere, which were aimed at addressing the epidemic.\n\nIn my opinion, and experience, most black people are genuinely concerned about black-on-black crime. It touches our family and friends, and affects our property value. However, liberal black people might talk about their concern more openly and fervently if they felt they could trust white people to end racial injustice and police brutality. Let's be real here, white conservatives will seize on anything to maintain the status quo, which enshrines white supremacy. I suppose it's logical. Scapegoats are convenient and work is hard enough. It's great to not have to deal with your race when applying for a job or working at the office. It's great to not have to worry about your race when a cop pulls you over. It's great to not have to prove basic intelligence because people automatically assume you are of superior intelligence because of your race. And it's great to be naturally associated with the most successful of your race rather than the least successful of your race. I mean, what is black authenticity if not ghetto realness?\n\nIt is in the interest of white conservatives to avoid fair competition by preserving these privileges, and that is the primary reason why Fox News will continue to pander to them by talking about black-on-black crime rather than police brutality. If Fox News made police brutality their concern, they would inevitably be led to crime statistics, which would inevitably lead them to poverty statistics, which would inevitably lead to employment discrimination, education disparities and the unequal treatment of black and brown people in the justice system. Fox News and their audience don't want to do anything about those issues.\n\nAt every turn on issues that, if addressed, would reduce the number of black men on the streets embracing a life of crime, conservatives have fought progress. There may be money for another useless warplane white working-class men get paid to build, but there is never enough money to overhaul inner-city schools. We can subsidize Big Agribusiness and Big Oil that soybean and oil barons fatten off of, but asking them to raise the minimum wage is sacrilege. Instead of talking about the fact that more whites than blacks use narcotics, but more blacks than whites go to prison for it; or the fact that in conservative states a black man is three times more likely to receive the death penalty than a white man for the same crime; or the fact that we have private prisons that make obscene profits from warehousing poor black and brown men for committing nonviolent crimes, conservatives would rather discuss President Barack Obama's birth certificate.\n\nWhite conservatives would rather discuss Obama's birth certificate or Beyonce and Jay-Z's marriage or black-on-black crime than real issues because the Fox News audience are convinced they benefit from the polices that oppress black and brown people. At best, by deporting Latinos, working-class whites benefit from keeping a lock on labor jobs. In the least, keeping black and brown children in failing schools maintains the fallacious idea that white people are superior. Unfortunately for white conservatives, the reality of a global economy, where shareholders can pay workers $1.36 per day in China, is revealing race for what it truly is: an illusion. The Almighty Dollar has been and will always be more important to the rich than any allegiance to tribe and race. That is the case with rich people of every race and culture.\n\nBlack people may also be reluctant to lay down the cause of police brutality and racial injustice because 60% of black people live a middle-class life or better. Those black people who have nothing to do with crime, and never have, are subjected to same racial-profiling from police that criminals are. Furthermore, the accomplishments of the black middle-class are often dismissed as acts of Affirmative Action, a.k.a. reverse racism; and black folks working in corporate America are too often subjected to racism. Speaking from personal experience, we have to overlook racial jokes and insults in order to succeed. This reality may influence many blacks to focus their attention on racial injustice rather than black-on-black crime.\n\nPerhaps black people will focus exclusively on eradicating black-on-black crime when white people focus exclusively on eradicating white supremacy. Until then, black folks will continue to focus on both issues, and make changing the policies and practices that contribute to crime in the black community a priority. No doubt, black people have work to do in our forgotten communities. However, conservatives have just as much work to do in changing the straight white male hegemony in our institutions, media, and corporations.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Trump's Toxicity & The Death Throes Of White Power\n\nManaging Editor, TheJazzChef.com, and pioneering ezine editor of the first sports ezine, MLNSports\n\nDonald Trump is a threat to American democracy. He's also a symptom. The 10.7M Americans who voted for him in the fractional, factional primaries, are part of the death throes of European, male-dominant white power struggling to hold onto control of an America, and a globe, that is coming out from under their long, tight grasp, in spite of the billions they spend on political power.\n\nMitt Romney handily won the white vote by 59% in 2012, and still lost that election to Barack Obama . People of color, minorities, will be the dominant population in this country by 2020, the U.S. Census tells us .\n\nAn Atlantic-Aspen Institute poll pegged the trend two years ago: American whites are feeling more and more pessimistic about their future in an America where there is a declining priority, preference, and privilege associated with a lighter shade of pale.\n\nMeanwhile, as the graphic also demonstrates, minorities are feeling, on the whole, more optimistic that participating in the system may finally yield them the American dreams of owning a home, their own business, being their own boss, or running for political office.\n\nParticularly over the last 30 years, Brookings reports , there has been a loss of income and power for males in general, and white males in particular.\n\nWe know, from multiple sources , that Trump's core supporters are largely white, middle class to poor, less educated, and often from backgrounds where white racial superiority coding was part of their upbringing. Many of them, at least quietly, see the future in dark, foreboding terms because the information engines which cater to and feed their thinking stoke it with fear. The GOP Convention was textbook white fear priming.\n\nThe economy is in great shape. So are jobs. Better than they've been in decades. Yet, inside the GOP Red Kool Aid bubble, America is terrible, awful, in decay.\n\nHow do so many people buy into that? Republicans have been on that downward propaganda spiral since the days of the New Deal .\n\nOld industrial elites, and their modern families, Kochs, Coors, Mellon-Scaifes,, et al, hate the New Deal because it wasn't just about a loss of the white industrial oligarchs' power in the Great Depression. It was the start of a whole progressive trend to get the United States to live up to the full meaning of \"We, the people\" and put some truth into \"all men are created equal.\"\n\nFor elite American industrial families, who believe their wealth and power comes from Social Darwinism , the mistaken notion that natural selection favors people of white, European, usually Christian extraction, true equality under law is anathema.\n\nPut Trump on that timeline. His candidacy is not the freak occurrence of the American political experience that the news media portrays it to be.\n\nTrump is a carcinogenic tumor on the body politic, a backlash of white Americans who have been taught, for centuries, in church and school and daily living, of their divine right superiority not just here at home, but in the world, and, yes, even in heaven. Here is a brief, sad history of how we got there.\n\nAt the founding of the nation, wealthy white power was patrician. Think Jefferson, Washington, et al. Big ideas about the rights of the individual, and the responsibility of the state to uphold those rights.\n\nWe had enormous problems with equality, but, by the standards of the day, which were far worse, America was insanely progressive. The notion that individual human rights existed , albeit strictly for the praying and pale, was, itself, such a radical notion that it rocked the world order of its day.\n\nEighty years later, wealthy whites split along economic lines. Early wealthy white industrialists exploited cheap, mostly white labor in the north, but they were still free, not slaves. Women were subjugated nationwide, and those who struggled with gender did so most quietly, for fear of reprisal or death. Southern plantations ran on the cheap labor of human slavery.\n\nTo preserve their power, wealthy whites employed several bits of cultural propaganda to marginalize people of color. The Algerist lies from his books like \" Mark the Matchboy \" and \" Ragged Dick \" that poor, white males with \"pluck\" could pull themselves up by their bootstraps and, through hard work, grit, and determination, become as rich as the richest whites out there, did not pan out for 99.9% of the population.\n\nThe other edge of that sword was that people of color failed in life because they were \"lazy,\" \"shiftless,\" etc. Women were kept in the kitchen, feminized into roles that demanded domesticity and subservience. Those with gender differences were \"eligible bachelors\" and \"tomboys\" or \"maiden aunts\" and expected to stay in the closet to avoid offending the sensibilities of male, white, right, America.\n\nThe nagging inconvenient truth that slavery was inconsistent with the freedoms and civil rights afforded all humans by the Constitution pushed Northern patrician whites to take a stand against their Southern peers.\n\nThe Civil war was prosecuted, won, and ended, but the divisions over race and gender didn't go away. They went underground slowly. At first, with \"separate but equal\" laws that still segregated society, then with the even more underground racism practiced today, ranging from police treatment of minorities to the infamous \" Birther \" movement against President Obama which Trump, himself, largely stoked.\n\nWhite male power, both Northern and Southern, ruled the latter part of the 19th century with an iron fist. The Great Depression, greed and overreach at their peak, shattered the notions of patrician white rule.\n\nUnionization, the civil rights movement, the women's rights movement, and the LGBTQ movement all pushed for civil parity with white America.\n\nThe progressive revolution of the 1960s and 1970s sprung out of the Civil RIghts movement. They mocked backwards blue-collar racists like Archie Bunker of \"All in the Family\" in the 1970s.\n\nThe notion that, even if you're a poor white, you are still \"No. 1,\" better off because you're not of color, remains an ingrained part of white American culture.\n\nSo much so, that, with losses of jobs to offshoring started in the Reagan years and accelerated dramatically during the George W. Bush administration, American whites are being primed by the funders with the constant buzz that they are now the ones being discriminated against.\n\nThe Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) found that 43% of Americans believe that whites are discriminated against just as much as people of color. With the possible erroneous conclusion that the vast majority of those respondents are white, and America's white population standing at 63% currently, that means that roughly 6 in 10 white Americans buy into the notion of white discrimination .\n\nAmerica has made huge strides in gender equality for women, but still remains 28th in the world . The same is true of gender identification in the LGBTQ communities, although quantitative tracking data on workplace, living, and legal discrimination is harder to come by.\n\nThe Republican Party has been both the cheerleader and the security blanket of angsty whites. Highly divided between the Neocons, who favor big business, and the rabidly anti-government Tea Party/Freedom Caucus, the GOP created a gap where a majority of disenfranchised, less religious or anti-government fearful whites ended up as largely independents.\n\nTrump was able to capture that base by tapping into their lust for a return of their status that was enjoyed for more than two centuries: 1950s style white male power.\n\nBarack Obama has been, primarily to older white conservatives, an omen of their loss of control of the nation to \"others.\" Which explains everything from the fact that 50% of this country bought into the Birther myth, to their irrational resistance to policies which Obama supported including the ACA (Romneycare) which were long-fought for Republican proposals.\n\nA woman in office affirms the continuing loss of male white power, especially a Clinton, which the GOP machine has ginned up millions to revile like Civil War vets used to utter \"Yankee\" and \"Reb,\" is equally anathema to older white males who are lower or middle income, or just social and racial regressives.\n\n\"This old white people business does get a little tired,\" Republican Representative Steve King of Iowa, and poster child of white male angst, said in response to a comment by Charles Pearce on MSNBC about white America's political struggles with minorities and women. He then posed the question, referring to white European Americans: \"Where did any other subgroup of people contribute more to civilization?\"\n\nThat comment, aside from being so woefully ignorant of the contributions of people of all colors and races to world history, is a symptom of white American males' fear of real equality domestically, and of globalization internationally.\n\nThe bad news for those who long for the days of June Cleaver serving dinner to dad in her cocktail dress, African-American servants and Japanese gardeners, is that the financial tide is turning against them not just here in the United States, but all over the world.\n\nWorldwatch reports that the \"consumer class\" is now about 1.7 billion people strong, with more than half of that number in the developing world.\n\n\"A lifestyle and culture that became common in Europe, North America, Japan, and a few other pockets of the world in the twentieth century is going global in the twenty-first,\" their report reveals.\n\nChina and India, not surprisingly, top the list of rapidly-growing nations. The number of \"consumer class\" citizens in Asia is around 16%. Europe by contrast, is 89%.\n\nGrowth, that all-important metric for capitalism's march towards greater profits, requires new consumers. Those will be found more in Asia than North America or Europe.\n\nWhich is not to say that there will be no jobs in America for working class high school to undergrad-educated whites. There are around 5.8M jobs that go unfilled in America, largely due to skills gaps. People aren't trained or qualified to do them.\n\nThus we have the delicious irony: Millions of poor and middle class white Americans flock to Donald Trump, captain of the GOP Titanic which has hit it's out-of-step iceberg and is taking on water, who has nothing other than platitudes about how \"great\" he will make America, when the real solutions offered by Bernie Sanders, Mrs. Clinton, and the Democrats for job retraining, affordable college, and infrastructure rebuilding all offer those self-same whites the greater opportunity to prosper.\n\nThe hardest key to their success? Changing understanding of pronouns.\n\nThe \" our\" in \"Our America,\" means everyone. Everyone.\n\nWhite America: It's time to play nicely with others, and position yourselves to succeed in a changing world.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Using MLK's Name in Vain: How Conservatives Twist Dr. King's Words\n\nWriter, SUM City\n\nPhoto: David Goldman/AP\n\nWhite conservatives have found an unlikely new icon to reference when spouting their ignorance on the web: Martin Luther King. In the past year or so, there has been a tendency for white people opposed to any outcry against police brutality and ongoing racial discrimination to invoke MLK's words about the content of character being the yardstick to judge a man instead of skin color. While those are indeed admirable words, conservatives interpret them into arguments for Black people to stop calling out the white supremacist status quo in America.\n\nIn the past week since Baltimore exploded, clandestine and outright racists who otherwise never have a good word to say about any Black person, have been all over social media saying things like: \"If Martin Luther King were alive, he would not approve of rioting,\" or that the people of Baltimore are protesting in the wrong way, or that they're using the wrong sort of language, and that \"Martin Luther King would never do that.\" While it's true that Martin Luther King was absolutely dedicated to nonviolence, a lot of the people who are using his words really have not studied his writings, and they obviously don't know any other speech of his besides \"I Have a Dream.\"\n\nLast December, I saw Selma . Not long after that, the annual MLK Day celebrations took place, and in Atlanta, that is always a major event. Both the film and the holiday rekindled my interest in Dr. King, and I was surprised by how militant a lot of his writing was.For MLK and others dedicated to it, the philosophy of nonviolence was not weakness or a surrender to white power; it was a moral crusade, designed to show the world the ugliness of white supremacy and segregation. While King always adhered to that tactic, he was also a relentless, withering critic of America's racist political, economic and social structure. Dr. King made some very powerful statements about the lack of education and opportunities in Black communities that sadly we still have to deal with today.\n\nDr. Martin Luther King was a Black radical. That fact gets overlooked by the people pulling his quotes out of context to denigrate the rioters in Baltimore and Ferguson. They are only using him for one reason; because to them, he represents a leader who kept Black people silent and submissive to police brutality and white racism without fighting back. Nothing could be further from the truth, and it's an insult to the man and his message.\n\nDr. King never condemned rioting without also condemning the system and conditions that created them. He famously said that, \"A riot is the language of the unheard.\" If nothing else, the events in Baltimore have proven that the injustices and suffering in Black neighborhoods goes unheard by white America until they erupt. I'm willing to bet that if he was alive, he would condemn those conditions today, and the same bigots using his legacy to attack present-day activists would disapprove of him just as much as they do the citizens of Ferguson and Baltimore now.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nLiberal commentators believe that you can have diversity or economic justice, but you can't have both. They're wrong.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nZack Beauchamp has a piece at Vox about how diversity is bad for economic justice. Normally I would ignore a piece like this, but it is part of a broader trend I've spotted within the liberal thinksphere after Trump that is worth discussing.\n\nWhy liberals might be interested in this story after Trump is pretty obvious. The narrative that has emerged from Trump's win is that nobody could have beaten the stupendous Whitelash that elected him. Clinton couldn't do it. Bernie couldn't do it. Nobody could do it. This exempts Democrats from any criticism of the party's support of Clinton over Sanders.\n\nThe problem with blaming Trump's win on angry whites is that white people did not support Trump in any larger numbers than they usually support Republicans.\n\nThe white share of the electorate was smaller in 2016 than it was in 2012, and Trump got a smaller share of the white vote than Romney in 2012 ( I , II ). The only racial groups Trump did better with than Romney, according to the exit poll, were blacks and Latinos. Putting aside the specifics of the Trump win, it is useful to consider the emerging liberal consensus on the problem of diversity. Here's Beauchamp:\n\nThe upshot is that a significant shift to the left on economic policy issues might fail to attract white Trump supporters, even in the working class. It could even plausibly hurt the Democrats politically by reminding whites just how little they want their dollars to go to \"those people.\" One can only imagine what Trump would tweet. ...\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that America's lack of a European-style welfare state hurts a lot of white Americans. But a large number of white voters believe that social spending programs mostly benefit nonwhites. As such, they oppose them with far more fervor than any similar voting bloc in Europe.\n\nIn this context, tacking to the left on economics won't give Democrats a silver bullet to use against the racial resentment powering Trump's success. It could actually wind up giving Trump an even bigger gun. If Democrats really want to stop right-wing populists like Trump, they need a strategy that blunts the true drivers of their appeal  -  and that means focusing on more than economics.\n\nThe argument, offered by this text and some nice graphics in the piece, is that diversity leads to racism, which leads to lower support for the welfare state, and thus creates widespread economic immiseration at the bottom of society. Beauchamp does not explain why exactly he thinks this is, but other liberal commentators, such as Ned Resnikoff , have attributed it to the \"ancient, tribal section of the human brain.\"\n\nWhat follows from this particular argument is pretty clear: you can have diversity or you can have economic justice, but you can't have both.\n\nTraditionally, this has been the arch-conservative position, especially when you bring in the biotruth of the human lizard brain. It is conservatives who say that we cannot mix different kinds of people, lest we increase social distrust, disharmony, and distance. It is conservatives who say that we need to monitor diversity levels in immigration to ensure that the immigrant share of the population does not get too high and to ensure that the immigrants who do come in are aggressively assimilated so as to erase the differences they initially bring with them.\n\nNot keeping diversity down and different groups separated from one another, conservatives maintain, will destabilize society, turn politics into a dangerous racialized contest for political power, and immiserate people in all sorts of subtle and not-so-subtle ways.\n\nAnd it's not just white conservatives who say this either. Right-wing black nationalist/separatist movements also hold these views. This shared political vision is how the iconic photo above of the American Nazi Party at a Nation of Islam gathering came about.\n\nMore and more, it seems like liberals in The Discourse agree with this basic conservative assessment of how diversity affects society. But, despite that underlying agreement, they somewhat bizarrely resist the conservative conclusion. Despite telling you that they think increasing diversity will result in children going hungry, as well as the mass incarceration and widespread discrimination of minority groups, they nonetheless support it.\n\nIf liberals are going to adopt the conservative view on how diversity operates in society, then they really do need to also work out what they think the implication of it is. Conservatives are very clear: diversity has all these problems and so it should be restricted. But the liberal view  -  that diversity has all these problems and yet it should be expanded without restraint  -  is just incoherent on its face.\n\nWhen I was coming up back in the day, this was not the liberal view on diversity, at least not the one I saw. The view then was that racism is a historical development, not an impenetrable feature of the tribal human brain.\n\nOn this view, human beings are fundamentally the same and socially constructed categories used to divide them (whether race in the US, religion in Ireland, or caste in India) can be overcome by uniting around what human beings have in common. On this view (which I share), there are obviously frictions caused by difference, especially when a particular difference has been historically weaponized to subordinate people. But those frictions can be overcome by organizing along lines that cut across those differences.\n\nThe clearest candidate for that is organizing along economic lines that aim to unite working-class people of all stripes into political and civil institutions together. But it is also conceivable to organize people along ideological or subcultural lines as well.\n\nIf you think that view is wrong, then you should actually explain what you think the consequences of it being wrong are. If diversity and justice really are at odds with one another, then which one should you pick and why? For myself, I strongly support both, do not believe they are mutually exclusive, and understand this to be the standard left position.\n\nBeauchamp's article gives a clue as to where liberals will go with this. Since they believe 1) diversity is incompatible with justice, and 2) that diversity is important and good, they will reach the conclusion that 3) justice should be sacrificed in order to \"beat\" right-wing populism.\n\nAs Beauchamp notes, pursuing a more economically just society \"could actually give Trump an even bigger gun\" because it flies in the face of the immiseration of racial minorities that majority groups in diverse societies necessarily demand. Thus, it would seem the only way forward is to give in to the bloodthirst some in order to stave off an even bigger atrocity.\n\nOf course, we've seen what this looks like before. It looks like Bill Clinton executing a mentally handicapped black man, promising to lock up blacks in huge numbers to keep down crime, and agreeing to starve black mothers and their children. That is what the pragmatic centrism that gives in some to the supposed difficult challenges of a diverse society actually looks like: a racist wet dream.\n\nMatt Bruenig is the founder of People's Policy Project .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nClarence Thomas has fused elements of black nationalism and a bleak view of black history with a steadfast Constitutional originalism.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhat follows is the talk I gave at the University of Washington this past weekend on my paper about Clarence Thomas: \"Smiling Faces Tell Lies: Pessimism, Originalism, and Capitalism in the Jurisprudence of Clarence Thomas.\"\n\nThe paper is still incomplete. I only managed to write about Thomas's theories of racism and how they intersect with his philosophy of constitutional interpretation. In the coming months, I intend to expand the paper to talk about Thomas's views on capitalism, and how they inform his jurisprudence about the Commerce Clause, the Takings Clause, and more.\n\nUltimately, this paper will be published by the University of Chicago Press in a volume on African-American political thought, edited by Melvin Rogers and Jack Turner. Other contributors will include: Cedric Johnson on Huey Newton, Nikhil Singh on Malcolm X, Lawrie Balfour on Toni Morrison, Michael Dawson on Marcus Garvey, Naomi Murakawa on Ida B. Wells, Jason Frank on Langston Hughes, Tommie Shelby on Richard Wright, Danielle Allen on Ralph Ellison, and many many more. It's going to be fantastic. But until then, here's my talk on Clarence Thomas.\n\nYesterday, Nikhil Singh said that more than any other figure in the African-American canon, Malcolm X is someone who everyone thinks they know. Clarence Thomas, I've discovered in the past six months, is also a figure who everyone thinks they know. In the interest of dispelling that expectation, which I suspect many of you share, I'd like to present five facts about Clarence Thomas that perhaps you didn't know.\n\nNow, the truth is that there's nothing all that surprising about the fact that Clarence Thomas is black and conservative. There's a long tradition of black conservatism in this country. And from Edmund Burke to Ayn Rand, conservatism always and everywhere has been the work of outsiders, men and women who hail from the peripheries or margins of the national experience.\n\nNor, in the end, is Clarence Thomas's early engagement with black radicalism all that surprising. After all, one of the great clichés of the twentieth century is the young left-wing radical graduating into middle-aged conservatism. And, of course, as Cedric Johnson, Michael Dawson, and other scholars have reminded us, there's a deep affinity between conservatism and parts of the Black Power/Black Nationalist tradition.\n\nBut here, I think, is what is surprising about Clarence Thomas. First, he's a Supreme Court justice who has managed in his jurisprudence to incorporate rather than repudiate some of his early commitments to Black Nationalism and Black Power; I think it's fair to say no other Supreme Court justice has ever done that.\n\nAnd, second, Thomas is a constitutional originalist, and a rather radical one at that. Unlike any other justice - not Scalia, not Roberts, not Alito - Thomas wants to restore the Constitution to the meaning it had in 1789.\n\nHow Thomas has been able to marry an incredibly bleak vision of the black past, a vision rooted in black nationalism, to a document that is not only the fountainhead of that past but is also, on his account, the source of an alternative black future - not, as Thurgood Marshall and other liberal constitutionalists would have it, because it is a \"living Constitution,\" but precisely because it is dead - that is the basic puzzle of Clarence Thomas and what makes him, I think, more interesting than many of us realized.\n\nIn my paper, I document both Thomas's involvement as a younger man in the broad milieu of Black Nationalism and how that involvement carries over into his jurisprudence. I use the phrase \"broad milieu\" deliberately. I don't want to overstate the depth or intensity of his involvement, and I don't want to posit a specificity, a precise location, to that involvement.\n\nReading Cedric Johnson's paper on Huey Newton, which Cedric presented yesterday, one sees this deep texture and particularity to the different arguments within the Black Power movement. You don't see that in Thomas. Instead you see someone who breathed in the broader atmosphere of Black Power and Black Nationalism, and never, I argue, stopped entirely breathing it. Or at least never stopped breathing part of it.\n\nSpecifically, what I think Thomas took away from that early engagement are two ideas. First, not only is racism a perdurable element of the American experience - and I want to stress that Thomas's concern, unlike that of more internationally minded figures like Newton, Malcolm X, or Angela Davis, is with racism as an American experience - but it is also a protean and often hidden element of that experience.\n\nThomas believes that racism is so profoundly inscribed in the white soul that you'll never be able to remove it. You see this belief in these quiet, throwaway lines in his opinions, which if you're reading too fast you'll miss.\n\nIn 1992, in one of his early cases, Georgia v. McCollum , Thomas stated, \"Conscious and unconscious prejudice persists in our society. Common sense and common experience confirms this understanding.\" In Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002), he wrote, \"If society cannot end racial discrimination, at least it can arm minorities with the education to defend themselves from some of discrimination's effects.\"\n\nThat \"if\" is a conditional only in the grammatical sense - that is, it governs the phrase that comes after - but not in the historical sense. Thomas's point is that society cannot in fact end discrimination.\n\nRacism is so profoundly inscribed in the white soul that you also have to dig deep in order to see its full extent. The deeper you dig, the closer you get to its beating heart. The overt bigotry of the South is merely the surface; its true depths are to be found in the North. Not among the angry white faces throwing rocks in South Boston, but in the genteel white smiles of liberal institutions like Yale Law School, which Thomas attended.\n\nIn his memoir, which came out in 2007, Thomas described the difference thus:\n\nAt least southerners were up front about their bigotry; you knew exactly where they were coming from, just like the Georgia rattlesnakes that always let you know when they were ready to strike. Not so the paternalistic big-city [northern and liberal] whites who offered you a helpful hand so long as you were careful to agree with them, but slapped you down if you started acting as if you didn't know your place. Like the water moccasin, they struck without warning.\n\nIf you're hearing a distant echo in that comment, you should. Think back to that famous passage in Malcolm X's \"Chickens Come Home to Roost\" speech:\n\nThe white conservatives aren't friends of the Negro either, but they at least don't try to hide it. They are like wolves; they show their teeth in a snarl that keeps the Negro always aware of where he stands with them. But the white liberals are foxes, who also show their teeth to the Negro but pretend that they are smiling. The white liberals are more dangerous than the conservatives; they lure the Negro, and as the Negro runs from the growling wolf, he flees into the open jaws of the \"smiling\" fox.\n\nYou've got the same animal imagery; the same emphasis on deceit and insincerity as the crucial marker.\n\nAnd here we come to the second idea that Thomas develops from his early engagements: The evil of the color line lies less in the hierarchies of white privilege and the humiliations of black subordination than in the deception and deceit that racism imposes upon blacks and whites alike.\n\nUnlike many in the Black Power tradition, or even in the black conservative tradition, Thomas seems never to have developed a political or economic analysis of racism. His is primarily a moral account of racism. Racism is shape-shifting, often hidden; that is its poison. The antidote to racism, the moral answer to it, is race sincerity: being truthful with and to oneself, and seeking truth, in however malignant a form, in and from one's enemies.\n\nThe goal is not, and never can be, color-blindness. The goal is racial candor or race sincerity, achieving a congruence between inner feeling and outward form.\n\nFor black Americans, that means giving up on the idea of racial authenticity, that there's an official way to be black: i.e., liberal, Democrat, etc. Hence, the black conservative who listens to Carole King. \"How could a black man be truly free if he felt obliged to act in a certain way,\" Thomas asks in his memoir, \"and how was that any different from being forced to live under segregation?\"\n\nNow that nod to segregation can sound pretty cheap. But I think it's a sincere statement from Thomas of the psychological and moral terms in which he understands the harm of racism: that it imposes a false, outward self upon the true, inner self.\n\nFor white Americans, race sincerity means owning up to the racism that lurks within. Particularly among white northern liberals, who find in programs like affirmative action a more palatable way to express their racist condescension toward blacks. So many of Thomas's opinions about affirmative action have far less to do with any commitment to state neutrality or color-blindness - or even a formalistic comparison between the use of race under Jim Crow and today - than they do with a belief that affirmative action is really just the sneaky face of contemporary racism.\n\nAs he wrote most recently in the Fisher v. University of Texas decision, which was in 2013, \"The worst forms of racial discrimination in this Nation have always been accompanied by straight-faced representations that discrimination helped minorities.\"\n\nWhile Thomas's two beliefs - in race pessimism, a belief in the perdurability and protean quality of racism; and race sincerity, the need to be on the outside what you are on the inside - come out of the black freedom movements, the role they assume in his political theory and jurisprudence reflect the waning power of those movements. Like many counterrevolutionary arguments, Thomas's beliefs about race are symptomatic of a movement in recession or retreat - in three ways.\n\nFirst, coming to consciousness at the end of the Black Freedom struggle, Thomas had and has difficulty seeing the achievements of that struggle as black achievements. In Thomas's eyes, civil rights, anti-discrimination, affirmative action, integration: these were not the work of African Americans, acting on their own behalf, wrangling power from a power structure that refused to give it to them. They are instead the poisoned apples of white liberals who prefer to give handouts rather than to cede power.\n\nLike many counterrevolutionaries (Tocqueville comes to mind), Thomas came too late to the revolution, too late to see the self-formation and self-assertion at work in movements of collective struggle. All he can see is a movement in retreat, and to his mind, the class of passive black dependents, waiting on the largesse of their white patrons of state, that the movement has left in its wake.\n\nAs he said of his sister, in one of his nastier and truly vicious remarks, \"She is so dependent [on the state] that she gets mad when the mailman is late with her welfare check.\"\n\nSecond, Thomas doesn't believe in political or collective action. The answer to the persistence of racism is to accept it and to figure out a way around it. A way, however, for individuals only: In Georgia v. McCollum , the answer to the persistence of white racism in society is to give individual black criminal defendants the right to strike down potential white jurors merely because they are white. Trying to organize collectively to defeat or even confront and call out racism is hopeless.\n\nAs he told Juan Williams in 1987:\n\nBlacks are the least favored group in this society. Suppose we did band together, group against group - which group do you think would win? . . . Which group always winds up with the least? Which group always seems to get the hell kicked out of it? Blacks, and maybe American Indians.\n\nThird, the only space for African-American agency is in the market, particularly in the labor that each generation performs on behalf of the next. Where politics is a sphere \"you don't have any control over,\" individual action in the market - which Thomas believes, it's important to stress, can be performed on behalf of the black community - is a space where you can say, \"I am in control of what I do today.\"\n\nThis is not an enlarged or particularly hopeful conception of agency; it's radically circumscribed and contained. The political realities of race cannot be overcome; the best you can do is make your way within those constraints, and whenever or wherever possible, apart from those constraints. That \"apart\" explains Thomas's willingness to indulge and support, even at the level of the state, all-black institutions.\n\nThis is not the sunny face of Reagan; it's not morning in Clarence Thomas's America. It's twilight: we're still living in the shadow of Jim Crow.\n\nThe two most consistent words you'll find in Thomas's work are \"sustain\" and \"survive.\" The story of black America is a story of black people surviving centuries of horror, from slavery to Jim Crow, by taking care of themselves and each other, and trying to keep away as much as possible from the cruelty around them.\n\nAnd this, I think, may be why Thomas has such faith in the project of originalism. Where other voices in the Black Freedom struggles either rejected the Constitution or found faith in its evolutionary openness - that is, in the interpretive distance the country has traveled since 1789 - Thomas finds a glimmer of hope in the return to its original meaning.\n\nThe Constitution may be the document of a slave society, but African Americans survived slavery. By returning to the original meaning of that document, Thomas believes they may find the tools to survive slavery's aftermath, as well.\n\nCorey Robin is the author of The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Donald Trump and a contributing editor at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Johnny Silvercloud / Flickr\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nA certain tendency has emerged among the liberal commentariat following the election of Donald Trump: a total identification of the president-elect with those who voted for him.\n\nJamelle Bouie gives it a pithy summary in a recent Slate article called \"There's No Such Thing as a Good Trump Voter,\" his most explicit articulation of a position he has alluded to consistently. \"All the solicitude, outrage, and moral telepathy being deployed in defense of Trump supporters - who voted for a racist who promised racist outcomes - is perverse, bordering on abhorrent,\" he writes.\n\nIt's redolent of a statement Hillary Clinton made on the campaign trail. Half of Trump's supporters, she said, fit into a \"basket of deplorables.\" When those supporters emerged from their basket in greater numbers than her own on Election Day - at least where it counted - it became clear that calling them \"deplorable\" wasn't an effective means of winning their votes. But you know what they say about hindsight.\n\nAt the time, this questionable strategy was considered a sound one by many liberal pundits. Jonathan Chait endorsed Clinton's remark in a piece at New York magazine titled \"Yes, Most Donald Trump Supporters Are Deplorable.\" After posing the question \"Do Trump's supporters legitimately share all of his deranged beliefs, or are they merely signaling some kind of tribal affinity?\", Chait concluded that it's \"a distinction without a difference.\"\n\nHe cited a study claiming Trump's backers are \"authoritarians\" who \"yearn for a strongman who can override the systemic constraints on presidential power.\" They're deplorable, Chait said, whether or not they agree with everything Trump says.\n\nFor Chait and Bouie, Trump voters didn't just make the wrong choice. They all lack legitimate grievances. Even a misguided social conscience, or mistaken self-interest, can't be entertained as possible causes of their decision. They voted solely out of malevolent disregard for the targets of Trump's invective.\n\nTrump was elected by 46.2 percent of American voters. That's around 20 percent of the American general population - well over 60 million people. Exit polls indicate that this number includes several million people of color. No one on the Left believes these voters were right to support Trump, but Bouie and Chait take it a step further. They don't even want to change their minds.\n\nThose who do want to change minds have been an additional target of Bouie's ire. In a subsequent article , \"The Democrats Are Screwing Up the Resistance to Donald Trump,\" Bouie takes Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders to task for speculating about why Trump won over so many working-class voters. \"Both Warren and Sanders emphasize that bigotry was part of Trump's message,\" he writes. \"But they want to separate the 'deplorables' from the larger group of more ordinary Americans who just wanted a change of pace.\"\n\nBouie doubts there's a difference. The attempt to understand Trump voters, he charges, is tantamount to collaboration with the president-elect himself. That Bouie's contempt is reserved for Sanders, Warren, and Minnesota representative Keith Ellison (coincidentally, the first-ever Muslim congressperson), rather than the likes of Clinton (\"we owe him an open mind\"), Barack Obama (\"we are now all rooting for his success\"), and Joe Biden (\"everything will be in good hands\") is a clear sign of partisan opposition to the Left rather than a principled stance.\n\n\"It seems reasonable for Warren and Sanders to make a distinction between Trump as blue-collar populist and Trump as racist demagogue,\" Bouie writes later in the piece. \"But that distinction doesn't exist.\" It's a neat trick: Bouie takes statements about the motives of voters and turns them into a description of the candidate.\n\n\"White voters backed Trump as a bloc ,\" he tells us. The assumption he takes for granted - that poor white Trump voters had the same motives as wealthy white Trump voters - has little grounding in evidence. He doesn't think it's necessary to provide any. Though willing to view people with common physical characteristics and cultural norms as a cohesive group, Bouie doesn't consider class a comparable category.\n\nIt's exactly this kind of liberal glibness toward class divisions that hampered Hillary Clinton in the general election.\n\nIn March , Bouie argued that in order to take the presidency, \"Democrats don't need to win working-class whites or even to come close.\"\n\nBy October , with Election Day approaching, he was holding to the same prediction. Today's Democratic Party, he argued, \"doesn't see a national future in winning white workers from the GOP.\"\n\nHillary Clinton is still on track to win this presidential election. And barring an extraordinary - and unlikely - collapse in Trump's support, she will do so with a revamped Obama coalition, comprising nonwhites; young voters; and an unprecedented number of moderate, suburban whites. She will have claimed the center of American politics, not by pandering to popular prejudices, but by rejecting them.\n\nAs it turns out, one of the reasons Clinton lost was because her campaign neglected states where working-class whites have historically voted Democratic .\n\nIn fact, as Nate Cohn noted in the New York Times in the wake of the election, Trump won many counties \"where Obama was strong among white working-class voters . \" Even more scandalously, Trump performed better among voters of color, including African Americans and Latinos, than Mitt Romney in 2012. Clinton, on the other hand, did worse than Obama among nonwhite voters.\n\nBouie has acknowledged that such news is \"somewhat surprising.\" But he's doubled down on the explanation he offered before the election: that all we're seeing is \"a white electorate fueled by tribalism and eager to reassert its dominance.\" There were just more people of color in it this time.\n\nWhile Bouie is convinced that Trump voters from every economic stratum are motivated by the same racist ideology, New York magazine's Jonathan Chait has a simpler explanation. It's because they're \"idiots.\" When Trump won the Republican nomination, Chait headed straight for his high horse.\n\nAs low as my estimation of the intelligence of the Republican electorate may be, I did not think enough of them would be dumb enough to buy his act. And, yes, I do believe that to watch Donald Trump and see a qualified and plausible president, you probably have some kind of mental shortcoming.\n\nThis was a remarkable position to take for a man who had argued three months earlier that liberals should \"earnestly and patriotically support a Trump Republican nomination.\" Chait insisted that Trump \"would almost certainly lose,\" but if by some impossible feat he did win, Trump \"might even, possibly, do some good.\" (Chait's stance would be more amusing if it didn't appear to be the Clinton campaign's position as well.)\n\nChait's critical faculties also failed him when it came to explaining Trump supporters. The \"authoritarian\" study he cited described them as obedient chumps - eager to follow leaders, aggressive toward outsiders. Evidence in hand, Chait arrived at the same conclusion as Bouie: Trump and his supporters were morally equivalent - \"irredeemable,\" in Clinton's words.\n\nWhat Chait didn't mention was that in the 2008 Democratic primary, a similar study found that Democrats with authoritarian tendencies preferred Hillary Clinton to Barack Obama. Even worse, he ignored a more recent study on GOP contenders. Supporters of Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, it found, were comparably accepting of authoritarianism - in Cruz's case, even more so. The difference was that Trump supporters exhibited populist tendencies - particularly anti-elitism and mistrust of experts - to a far greater extent than supporters of his Republican rivals.\n\nAs Christian Parenti has pointed out , the racist and misogynistic statements that usually made it into the news - important and repugnant as they were - may not have been the aspect of Trump's rhetoric some supporters took home with them. \"Choppy as they were,\" Parenti writes, \"Trump's speeches nonetheless had a clear thesis: Regular people have been getting screwed for far too long and he was going to stop it.\"\n\nBouie and Chait don't usually see eye to eye on race and class.\n\nWhile Bouie thinks the Left downplays racism, Chait thinks we see it everywhere. These days, he's best known as an opponent of \"political correctness.\" Trump supporters may be deplorable, but to Chait, the worst authoritarians are on the Left.\n\nBorrowing from a right-wing conspiracy theory made famous by Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik, Chait traces the origins of identity politics and privilege discourse to Marxism. Today's left, he says, has replaced the struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie with the struggle of black against white, woman against man, and gay against straight.\n\nFor Chait, class is a kind of identity, and identity is to be rejected outright. Indeed, it was precisely on this basis that Chait denounced Bernie Sanders during his primary campaign.\n\nClass, in [Sanders's] telling, means far more than a rough description for a person's income or level of social need. It is the singular prism through which Sanders views politics. He does not merely argue that people with different incomes have different economic interests. He treats class as the fundamental identity in American society.\n\nBefore the recent furor over political correctness on campus, Chait's take on identity politics landed him in a public back-and-forth with Bouie.\n\nThe dispute began with a 2014 reflection on racism and the Obama presidency, in which Chait quoted Lee Atwater's notorious explanation of what came to be known as a \"dog whistle.\"\n\nYou start out in 1954 by saying, \"Nigger, nigger, nigger.\" By 1968 you can't say \"nigger\" - that hurts you, backfires. So you say stuff like, uh, forced busing, states' rights, and all that stuff, and you're getting so abstract. Now you're talking about cutting taxes, and all these things you're talking about are totally economic things, and a by-product of them is blacks get hurt worse than whites.\n\nThis year, Bouie rightly noted that the dog whistle was a primary characteristic of Trump's campaign.\n\nBut two years ago, in a more innocent time, Chait thought looking for dog whistles was unfair. Liberals, he said, have acted as though \"Republican politics is fundamentally racist, and even its use of the most abstract economic appeal is a sinister, coded missive.\" Chait found that \"completely insane.\" Accusing someone of racism and actually being racist were, for Chait, roughly equivalent offenses.\n\nBouie vigorously disagreed . Chait, he said, paid little attention to the actual effects of racism, treating it as \"a low-stakes cocktail party argument between white liberals and white conservatives over their respective racial innocence.\" Chait countered that he was colorblind; he simply intended to \"treat black Americans as part of a red-blue partisan divide, as opposed to treating them as black Americans, per se.\" According to his analysis, \"the Obama era has produced a cleavage along ideological rather than racial lines.\"\n\nYet somehow this rather acrimonious dispute - with Bouie arguing for the primacy of race in American politics and Chait effectively arguing for its irrelevance - didn't lead them to different political positions when Trump's stock soared. Content to impute Trump's odious views to all of his supporters, Bouie and Chait were united in their moralistic contempt.\n\nIn May, Bouie and Chait appeared in a joint interview on New York public radio. In spite of their attention to the history of coded racism in the Republican Party, they agreed to let the GOP off the hook.\n\nChait spoke of \"a disconnect between themes that Republicans use to win elections, and then the purposes to which they apply that power once they've won it.\" He argued that racism, whether overt or subterranean, merely capitalizes on \"cultural resentments\" in order to \"harness them into votes.\" Once they gain power, Republicans advance colorblind conservative policies - \"things like cutting the capital gains tax, deregulating Wall Street, fossil fuels, and that sort of thing.\"\n\nBouie didn't dispute this, suggesting that repudiating Trump could help the GOP mature into a gentler organization.\n\nThe potential upside to Trump is just that maybe he changes how the Republican Party does its business, how it appeals to voters. Maybe it disabuses Republican elites of these plays to white resentment and white anger and forces or moves the party in a more, not necessarily liberal, but more open and cosmopolitan direction.\n\nTheir agreement anticipated a position Clinton would take in August, outlined in a speech that castigated Trump for his reluctance to renounce his white nationalist supporters. Clinton named Bob Dole, John McCain, and George W. Bush as exemplars of antiracism, exonerating the GOP for politics that, she implied, were solely Trump's.\n\nWhile Bouie and Chait's strange truce allowed them to align with Clinton's centrist appeal to moderate Republicans, the supposedly class reductionist Bernie Sanders consistently held a different position. In February's Democratic primary debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Sanders noted class disparities that he ascribed to \"institutional racism.\"\n\nAs I understand it, the African-American community lost half of their wealth as a result of the Wall Street collapse. So when you have childhood African-American poverty rates of 35 percent, when you have youth unemployment at 51 percent, when you have unbelievable rates of incarceration - which, by the way, leaves the children back home without a dad or even a mother - clearly, we are looking at institutional racism. We are looking at an economy in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. And sadly, in America today, in our economy, a whole lot of those poor people are African-American.\n\nSanders won the Wisconsin primary, but the state went to Trump in the general election. After securing the nomination, Hillary Clinton didn't pay it a single visit. Turnout around the state, usually among the highest in the country, plummeted to a sixteen-year low. The sharpest declines, the New York Times reports , were in the poorest areas, with Milwaukee's majority-black District 15 showing a nearly 20 percent drop from 2012.\n\nOne African-American resident explained his antipathy, telling the Times that \"no president in his lifetime had done anything to improve the lives of black people.\" He wrote in Sanders on Election Day. Another District 15 resident voted for Trump as a protest against Clinton, whose husband he holds responsible for sending him to prison (District 15 has one of the nation's highest per-capita incarceration rates). Trump's overt racism, he is quoted as saying, is \"better than smiling to my face but going behind closed doors and voting against our kids.\"\n\nIf voters like these don't correspond to Chait and Bouie's description, it's because there's a fatal flaw in their schema.\n\nEarlier this week, Bouie responded at length to Columbia University history professor Mark Lilla's recent New York Times op-ed calling for a \"post-identity liberalism.\" Lilla goes even further than Chait, arguing that the liberal \"obsession with diversity has encouraged white, rural, religious Americans to think of themselves as a disadvantaged group whose identity is being threatened or ignored.\"\n\nHis analysis is the most questionable of all: rural whites, Lilla contends, voted for Trump as a high-minded critique of trigger warnings and safe spaces on college campuses. And his antidote is even more insidious.\n\nAs Bouie correctly points out, the practitioners of the ostensibly universalist politics that Lilla touts - Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton - presided over administrations that were particularly damaging to marginalized groups. In response - and to his credit - Bouie calls for a reinvigorated \"Rainbow Coalition.\"\n\nThough popularized (and eventually copyrighted) by Jesse Jackson, the original Rainbow Coalition was launched in 1969 under the direction of the Black Panther Party's Illinois chairman, Fred Hampton. The coalition began as a collaboration between the Panthers and the \" hillbilly nationalist \" Young Patriots Organization , before expanding to include the Young Lords and other smaller groups.\n\nThe Young Patriots consisted mostly of Appalachian migrants, who lived in Chicago's desperately impoverished Uptown neighborhood. Though Panther organizer Bob Lee knew the area was a \"prime recruiting ground for white supremacists,\" he found common cause in the YPO's counterstrategy: advocating for socialism and racial justice.\n\nIn a speech delivered not long before his murder by the FBI and the Chicago Police department, Fred Hampton explained the rationale behind the original Rainbow Coalition:\n\nWe got to face some facts. That the masses are poor, that the masses belong to what you call the lower class, and when I talk about the masses, I'm talking about the white masses, I'm talking about the black masses, and the brown masses, and the yellow masses, too. We've got to face the fact that some people say you fight fire best with fire, but we say you put fire out best with water. We say you don't fight racism with racism. We're gonna fight racism with solidarity. We say you don't fight capitalism with no black capitalism; you fight capitalism with socialism.\n\nIn the decades since, the need for working-class unity has only grown more urgent. Bouie himself has noted that the percentage of people of color in the working class is increasing. But even this accurate observation has been couched in error. Today's voters, he said in May , \"aren't the struggling whites of Appalachia or the old Rust Belt, in part because those workers don't vote, and there's no evidence Trump has turned them out.\"\n\n\"Insofar that he represents any of it,\" Bouie argued, \"Trump just speaks for a portion of working America, and the same divisions of race and religion that make broad working-class movements rare also limit the ability of a Trump figure to succeed.\"\n\nYet Trump succeeded. If the divisions Bouie points to were rigid enough to make his victory possible, Bouie's own hypothesis proves that only a \"broad working-class movement\" can effectively oppose him.\n\nDuring the Democratic National Convention, Bouie pointed a disapproving finger at the \"Bernie or Bust\" contingent that withheld support from Hillary Clinton.\n\nFor as much as they say they want a progressive path for the future of the country - a \"political revolution,\" as it were - are they willing to enter any coalition to achieve it? Is there anything Clinton (or Sanders or Warren) can say or do to attract their support? Are they here to win, or are they here to perform?\n\nProjections before the general election showed that 72 percent of Sanders supporters planned to vote for Hillary Clinton. The majority were, in fact, willing to enter that coalition. The question now is whether liberals will show the same willingness to advocate the coalition that holds the best chance of defeating the far right: a unified working class.\n\nUnfortunately, many in the liberal pundit class have resisted self-examination even after the Election Day debacle. By 2018 and 2020, Chait writes , \"Trump will solve the Democrats' voter-complacency problem for them.\" Give Trump enough rope to hang himself with - which is to say, the highest office in the country - and he'll oblige. This is precisely the posture Chait took toward Trump's candidacy. To see him repeating it after such a resounding failure beggars belief.\n\nAs for Bouie, his latest contribution is encouraging (if oddly antagonistic towards Sanders, whom he bends over backwards to disagree with). By invoking the Rainbow Coalition, Bouie is joining the Left in calling for a politics \"that takes identity and class seriously, that understands their relationship and interplay, that appeals to common identities and forges responsive solutions.\" He quotes a passage from Jesse Jackson's 1988 Democratic National Convention speech describing the experience of different marginalized groups as separate patches of cloth, all of which have to be unified into a quilt by \"sturdy hands and a strong cord.\"\n\nFor Bouie, the patches are worthy of attention - mass incarceration, housing, marriage rights, and other issues central to any left program - but he makes no attempt to identify the strong cord that binds them. This is where he falls short.\n\nBuilding today's coalition requires the same precondition that both Jesse Jackson and Fred Hampton identified - the strong cord of solidarity that unites the powerless against the powerful.\n\nLiberal pundits can no longer play the role of oracle, foretelling a future that has not come to pass. If they're serious about resisting Trump, their task now is to articulate a strategy that can mobilize and unite the entire working class, from disillusioned black workers in Milwaukee to angry white workers in Pennsylvania.\n\nMore than anything, the question for liberal pundits is: are they here to win, or are they here to perform? If they revert to pleas to \"claim the center\" - as Bouie hailed Clinton for doing, on the strength of suburban Republican voters - they'll leave Trump emboldened and social progress in retreat. And they'll be engaging in exactly the kind of apolitical posturing that they routinely accuse the Left of deploying.\n\nDonald Trump is deplorable and irredeemable. That much is incontestable. But if we see all of his supporters that way, defeat is guaranteed.\n\nShuja Haider is a writer and musician based in Brooklyn and an editor at Viewpoint Magazine .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

(Spencer Platt / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe David Dinkins legacy has always been complex, ripe for revision and misunderstanding. New York City's first and only black mayor, who died yesterday at the age of ninety-three, served for just a single term, from 1990 through 1993. It was a period of economic and racial tumult for the city, when just about anyone left of center was forced into a defensive crouch.\n\nDinkins, courtly and well-dressed, was easy for some to vilify. For conservatives, the Harlem Democrat was indecisive and squishy liberalism personified, unable to tame rising crime and serving as a forgettable bridge between two mayors who loomed far larger in the popular imagination, Ed Koch and Rudy Giuliani.\n\nFor leftists in 2020, it's not particularly difficult to dismiss Dinkins as another establishment, vaguely neoliberal Democrat who expanded the police force, tried to draw close to real estate and business elites, and failed to arrest the rising income inequality we grapple with to this day.\n\nBut that would not be exactly fair to a mayor who was very much of his time and place, who had his ambitions checked by reactionary forces and a faltering economy. Dinkins, a former Democratic Socialists of America member who kept a picture of Paul Robeson in his office when he was Manhattan borough president, quietly poured billions into rehabilitating dilapidated housing, expanded school hours to help poor students, and funded assisted housing for the mentally ill.\n\nBut though Dinkins campaigned on anti-austerity aspirations, he was forced to implement devastating cuts when he took office. In his first budget, he slashed spending on education, health, housing, education, and social services for children, the elderly, and the poor. Despite raising taxes by $800 million, the largest increase in city history, under Dinkins the city government was constricting instead of expanding.\n\nFor a figure who as late as 1990 was praising Eugene Debs and quoting A. Philip Randolph and Michael Harrington, it was a stunning reversal that showed how trapped many progressive executive officials felt in an era of austerity and the especially difficult context Dinkins found himself in.\n\nWinning with a coalition of black Americans, organized labor, and other progressives, Dinkins entered office at a moment when an incendiary local real estate developer named Donald Trump was initiating a racist campaign against the Central Park Five, and a black teenager, Yusuf Hawkins, had been shot to death by a white mob in Bensonhurst.\n\nNew York City, at the dawn of the 1990s, was slowly rebounding from the fiscal crisis more than a decade earlier. Still, it remained a city on the brink, with rising homicide rates and racial resentment that had been stoked by the man Dinkins defeated in the 1989 Democratic primary, Ed Koch.\n\nKoch would enjoy a far grander reputation in the local media, despite a series of corruption scandals and a general disregard for the lives of gays during the AIDS epidemic. Koch, like Giuliani and Trump, was a master of white grievance politics, gleefully clashing with civil rights leaders and aligning himself with pernicious police unions, ignoring the everyday New Yorkers suffering in their wake.\n\nBy today's standards, with police defunding movements gaining steam, Dinkins would not seem much better - he fought for a new tax to hire more cops. It must be remembered that more than two thousand New Yorkers could be murdered in a year, the crack epidemic was ongoing, and most voters were desperate for answers.\n\nUnlike Koch and Giuliani, Dinkins did not believe in unfettered police power. Like the last liberal to lead New York City before him, John Lindsay, Dinkins argued civilian oversight of the NYPD was required to provide some kind of check on their terrifying clout.\n\nIn the 1960s, Lindsay had tried and failed, his civilian policy oversight board defeated at the polls, where police unions waged a ferocious campaign to ensure the referendum died quickly. \"I am sick and tired of giving in to minority groups with their whims and their gripes and shouting,\" the head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association declared at the time.\n\nSubsequent mayors avoided the issue altogether, blindly praising the overwhelmingly white police force and moving on. Dinkins knew he had to do better. In 1993, as he was seeking reelection, Dinkins successfully created the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) to conduct investigations and prosecutions of police misconduct.\n\nFor the first time, the all-civilian CCRB provided some recourse for those who had been brutalized by police.\n\nThe story of Dinkins cannot be told without Giuliani, who once enjoyed a level of undeserved bipartisan regard from New York's pundit class. The Giuliani mythos began in the 1980s, when he prosecuted mobsters and enraptured a generation of journalists attracted to tough guys and Manichean narratives.\n\nUnlike Koch, Giuliani pitched himself as a good government revanchist, able to manage a city scandal-free while keeping minorities in check. Dinkins narrowly defeated the Republican Giuliani in 1989 but a rematch was always coming: Giuliani only needed to nudge a few more white voters into his corner and victory would be assured.\n\nThe New York City of the early 1990s was extremely racially polarized. Traditionally, more conservative white ethnics in the outer boroughs had dominated municipal primaries. Only Lindsay, a liberal Republican who forged close ties with black voters, and Dinkins were able to overcome this resistance.\n\nThough many of the cognoscenti tut-tut at Giuliani's transmogrification from America's mayor into President Trump's maniacal and slobbering lawyer, those who pay close attention understand that the Rudy of today is not so different than the younger, slimmer version who faced down Dinkins for a second time in 1993.\n\nThat Giuliani was as well-schooled in the politics of racial resentment . In 1992, after Dinkins pitched the idea of civilian oversight of the police, Giuliani led a riot of off-duty police officers at City Hall. Traffic was blocked on the Brooklyn Bridge and journalists were injured. \"He never supports us on anything,\" a police officer complained about Dinkins. \"A cop shoots someone with a gun who's a drug dealer, and he goes and visits the family.\"\n\nNo matter what Dinkins did for police, he could never, as a black man, earn their respect. Compounded with the criticism he drew for his slow response to the Crown Heights riots in 1991, in which blacks and Orthodox Jews clashed in Brooklyn, Dinkins could not quite retain the coalition that brought him to City Hall.\n\nIn November 1993, Giuliani bested Dinkins by about 3 percentage points, though he only carried two out of the five boroughs , Queens and Staten Island. Giuliani's margin of victory came from Staten Island, where white conservatives handed him a stunning 83 percent of the vote. To this day, Staten Island is the only borough in New York City that has supported Trump in both presidential elections.\n\nIn the New York Times , Dinkins was described as someone who \"suffered by comparison with the Gullivers bestriding him,\" in reference to Koch and Giuliani, the ludicrously belligerent mayors who hemmed Dinkins in on both sides. That is not quite right. Koch and Giuliani could be quite small. And Dinkins, more importantly, was no Lilliputian.\n\nRoss Barkan is a writer and journalist in New York City.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Gendron, is said to have scrawled racial slurs onto the barrel of his gun and to have published a racist manifesto that runs into the hundreds of pages. Gendron seems to have placed a special emphasis on \" great replacement theory ,\" the right-wing belief that \"elites\" are deliberately trying to replace white Europeans and Americans with immigrants and other people of color.\n\nOnce relegated to the fringes, great replacement theory has made its way to the mainstream of the conservative movement, with a third of respondents in one poll saying they believed in it. Fox News host Tucker Carlson , in particular, has constantly brought the conspiracy theory into the homes of millions of nightly viewers, as the New York Times has extensively documented . The Times also cites numerous elected officials who have espoused some version of great replacement theory.\n\nBut while many articles in the Times and elsewhere have addressed the mainstreaming of the repugnant great replacement theory, fewer have addressed how it fits into the broader antidemocratic right-wing agenda. (Matthew Cunningham-Cook in Jacobin and Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor in the the New Yorker are notable exceptions.) Great replacement theory is, at bottom, a tool for increasingly unpopular conservative elites to justify to their base the use of increasingly extreme, antidemocratic, and yes, occasionally violent measures to maintain their power.\n\nThe American right has never been concerned with democracy, and since Donald Trump's election and subsequent loss , it has accelerated its attempts to insulate its ability to exercise power from democratic checks. Specifically, that means ensuring white conservatives remain the dominant political force regardless of the popularity of their ideas. To do this, conservatives skillfully take advantage of the undemocratic American political system in perfectly banal ways. But they also increasingly rig it in their favor by engaging in heavy gerrymandering and voter suppression, restricting civil rights and the right to protest for leftists and people of color while praising violent right-wing protests , and tapping a virtually unlimited pool of dark money that a decade of conservative court rulings has made it legal to accept.\n\nAll of these tactics show that if the Right hasn't yet completely given up on democracy, it is certainly building the infrastructure to allow it to do so. Critical to this effort is the idea that not only are white conservatives the only legitimate voters but that they are being oppressed and undermined by people of color. Therefore, the reasoning goes, measures like denying immigrants access to public schools, removing serious discussion about slavery and racism from curricula, and simply throwing out votes for Democrats are actually just rebalancing the scales - defensive measures by \"legitimate\" Americans under attack by those who want to replace them.\n\nThis idea is pounded into the conservative base constantly by mass media and elected officials. Tucker Carlson summed up great replacement theory with surprising bluntness, saying \"The Democratic Party is trying to replace the current electorate, the voters now casting ballots, with new people, more obedient voters from the Third World.\"\n\nAs vile and contemptible as their rhetoric is, it is unlikely that people like Carlson, Trump, and other high-level conservatives espousing great replacement theory actively want their followers to commit racist murder. But as the 2021 storming of the Capitol shows - along with the much longer history of violence by the antiabortion movement and racist militias like the Ku Klux Klan - the \"respectable\" right is adept at maintaining ties with the violent fringe of its base while keeping just enough distance to portray any questions about their sympathies as further evidence of their supposed persecution.\n\nAgain, Carlson demonstrated this tactic with bracing directness. On his Monday evening program, he managed to turn himself into the victim of the Buffalo shootings, saying in response to reports that his show heavily influenced the shooter, \"So, what is hate speech? Well, it's speech that our leaders hate. So because a mentally ill teenager murdered strangers, you cannot be allowed to express your political views out loud. That's what they're telling you.\"\n\nThe callousness and self-pity is shocking but not surprising. Great replacement theory and related ideas have inspired multiple mass murders before Saturday, and there is no reason to think Buffalo's will be the last. Its proponents simply don't care, as long as they can use the theory to help them stay in power.\n\nBen Beckett is an American writer in Vienna.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn January 20, 1986, half a million people looked on as the inaugural Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade wended down Peachtree Street and turned into Auburn Avenue, in downtown Atlanta. Thousands marched, singing civil rights movement anthems, in a scene that reminded the New York Times of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nOn this day, however, police supported rather than menaced marchers. Coretta Scott King, widowed seventeen and a half years earlier, led bands, unionists, war veterans, 280 different groups, and some of the city's homeless population through the city streets. Movement veteran and Atlanta mayor Andrew Young watched as crowds overflowed into the street and temporarily halted the procession, blurring the boundary between spectators and marchers. Begun in the early afternoon, after four hours the parade finished at King's crypt on \"Sweet Auburn,\" as the avenue was affectionately known.\n\nThe celebrations did not end there. Promoted with the slogan \"Living the Dream,\" the holiday's reach extended across the nation. That night, NBC televised a two-hour program of concert highlights from Atlanta, New York, and Washington, DC. Musician Stevie Wonder organized the events and edited footage for the two-hour national television extravaganza. Eight thousand radio stations across the nation played excerpts of King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech at midday, and the New York Times reported that \"church bells tolled, choirs sang and citizens paused\" to reflect. Andrew Young aptly summarized the mood: \"The leader may have departed . . . but the dream continues.\"\n\nMartin Luther King Jr .'s legatees were, however, divided. Coretta Scott King and Andrew Young hoped that the holiday would keep King's dream alive, inspiring Americans to complete his unfinished work. Thus, they worked to foster a mood of celebration and avoided overt politicking.\n\nOthers, however, voiced concern over the commemorations' tone. Disturbed by the festive atmosphere, Jesse Jackson and Julian Bond reminded Americans of King's radical civil disobedience . Wyatt T. Walker warned against being \"oversentimental and romantic.\" They were concerned that the celebrations smoothed over King's legacy, making him palatable for a nation unwilling to comprehend his critique, a nation unwilling to adopt his entire agenda as its own.\n\nSince 1986, those seeking political and social reform in the United States have used it to advance their cause, despite its original apolitical tone. Those who have wanted to maintain the status quo have used it to argue that King's dream has been fulfilled. In the process, King's words have often been distorted beyond meaning, his virtues exaggerated and his deficiencies weaponized. Today, every effort to memorialize him is fraught with contradiction: to remember King risks forgetting his radicalism.\n\nDuring the mid-to-late 1960s, while raising four children - Yolanda, Martin, Dexter, and Bernice - Coretta Scott King reemerged as an activist in her own right. She also became the prime guardian of her late husband's legacy, particularly after initiating construction of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change . As Coretta commissioned monuments, she continued her activism , vigorously opposing apartheid in South Africa and lobbying for full employment , among many causes .\n\nAfter establishing and completing the King Center, Coretta lobbied Congress for the King holiday. Activists and politicians forged the holiday from a long history of black resistance, married it to an American holiday tradition, and elevated an African American man to the previously segregated pantheon of American heroes.\n\nKing is the only American citizen, black or white, personally identified by name on the US calendar. And despite its early apolitical tone, the holiday developed into a day on which activism could flourish. In King's name, protesters have denounced events ranging from the 1991 Gulf War to incidents of police brutality. On King Day, movement veterans and their heirs in Black Lives Matter have taken to the streets, while conservatives sometimes receive cool or hostile receptions from black church congregations. Though impossible for the eponymous holiday to be all its promoters hoped, the \"national spotlight,\" as historian David Chappell described it , shines on King's message every January.\n\nYet while it is easy to find words of acclaim for King it is difficult to find similar praise for the King holiday. Scholars maintain that it fails to recall King's radicalism. Vincent Harding, a former speechwriter for King, Christian pacifist, and historian, argued that those who fought for the holiday allowed \"King to become a convenient hero, to try to tailor him to the shape and mood of mainstream, liberal/moderate America.\" Harding elaborated, \"The price . . . is the development of a massive case of national amnesia.\" G. Russell Seay Jr. argues that King has been domesticated and \"fossilized.\"\n\nThe concern about King memorialization, as exemplified by the holiday, is that it typically portrays his agenda as complete. Dianne Nash, a founding member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), feared that such exaltation of King would deter future generations from becoming activists - either because future injustices would not seem as dire as those in the past, or because youth would simply wait for the next great leader rather than start their own movement. Either way, Nash viewed the idolatry of King as potentially demobilizing.\n\nJermaine McDonald argues that King's legacy is contested, not domesticated, because the nation's collective memory is deeper than and not as fixed as critics claim. Those who invoke the radical King can ignore King's own history of strategic compromise and downplay the instances when he moved with caution (for instance, during the 1964 fight over seating Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegates at the Democratic National Convention ). In this light, King is an inconvenient hero not only for liberals and conservatives, but at times even progressives and radicals.\n\nCoretta Scott King and Andrew Young repeatedly emphasized their view that King was the leader of the movement. They portrayed King as a master tactician, brilliant orator, theologian, preacher, and radical activist, among other descriptions. However, as Clayborne Carson writes , the depiction of King as \"the initiator and sole indispensable element in the southern black struggles of the 1950s and 1960s\" is mythical.\n\nCarson argues that the myth overemphasizes the importance of King's leadership qualities at the expense of other \"large-scale social factors\" that propelled movement. As it is an oversimplification to say that Eugene \"Bull\" Connor, the 1963 commissioner of public safety in Birmingham, Alabama, and Jim Clark, the sheriff who led the 1965 attack on civil rights marchers in Selma, Alabama, were solely responsible for racism, it is an oversimplification to claim that King was solely responsible for fighting racial oppression\n\nOn April 8, 1968 - just four days after King's murder - Democratic congressman John Conyers of Michigan introduced King Day legislation to the House of Representatives in an effort to commemorate not only the recently assassinated King but also the movement in which he had figured so prominently. Federalizing the commemoration of King's birth became Conyers's cause, and along with the Congressional Black Caucus, he negotiated with white liberals and skeptical white conservatives in Congress, whose votes were required to pass the legislation.\n\nAfter fifteen years of wrangling, Congress finally approved MLK Day legislation in 1983. The following year, lawmakers established the Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Commission to coordinate the first King Day and to organize a celebration with appeal to a broad spectrum of American society. Coretta Scott King chaired the organization, which included representatives and senators from Congress, presidential appointees, and selected leaders from businesses, unions, religious organizations, civil rights groups, and the entertainment industry. For eleven years, the commission organized the holiday until it disbanded in 1996 after Dexter Scott King, Martin and Coretta's second son, attacked it from within.\n\nCongress tasked the commission with inventing new traditions. The commission thus aimed to create a popular holiday in a majority-white nation, while fulfilling a historic desire for a \"black\" holiday. The commission also sought to continue King's work in the fields of integration and nonviolence. First, it attempted to integrate the US calendar, furthering a process Congress initiated by declaring the first national holiday honoring an African American. To achieve this aim, the holiday had to be established in every state, and Americans from all ethnic backgrounds would have to participate in celebrations. Second, Coretta Scott King, the commission's leader, insisted that the holiday propagate the philosophy of nonviolence. Coretta hoped that a focus on both themes, integration and nonviolence, would set the template for a popular annual celebration.\n\nWith President Reagan's encouragement, the commission also sought to imbue the holiday with idealized American values - namely, respect for the Constitution, Christianity, and the rights of the individual. Yet these concepts were promoted at the expense of King's condemnation of economic inequality and militarism. Further, King Day's opponents threatened to undermine its universality by depicting it as a \"black\" holiday, only relevant to African Americans. As Reagan eroded the federal government's commitment to civil rights laws, white and black conservatives manipulated King's words in ways antithetical to the fallen leader's philosophy.\n\nKing's \"I Have a Dream\" speech provided early inspiration for the holiday, particularly during the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. Politicians of all persuasions used King's \"dream,\" yet conservatives focused almost exclusively on this aspect of his legacy. Reagan used King in such a manner to promote individualism, capitalism, and conservative Christianity. Bush too prioritized a narrative that highlighted individual valor within the civil rights movement, as opposed to collective endeavor .\n\nWhen King's former colleagues rejected the officially sanitized image of King the Dreamer - shorn of radicalism - their dissatisfaction laid the foundation for reform. Following his election in 1992, Democrat Bill Clinton legislated for a day of service that shifted the holiday's emphasis from the dream to volunteer community service, tilting King Day a little more toward activism than mere commemoration.\n\nProgressive Democrats like John Lewis fostered a new King image: King the Drum Major. In his February 4, 1968, \" Drum Major Instinct \" sermon, King had vociferously denounced not only racism but economic inequality and militarism. Although the holiday did not become radical per se, pointing to the Drum Major highlighted the fact that King's agenda remained unfinished, particularly in relation to economic inequality. As King had encouraged his parishioners to devote themselves to humble acts of service, so the commission encouraged Americans to emulate his deeds by serving their local communities. All citizens, no matter how lowly, could work toward the completion of King's unfinished agenda.\n\nBill Clinton also found meaning in the \"Drum Major Instinct\" sermon. Yet these reforms complemented a suite of neoliberal economic policies, in vogue at the time, when mainstream US politicians, Clinton very much included , wanted to cut taxes and welfare spending.\n\nMartin Luther King Day emerged as part of a move to memorialize the civil rights movement. Proponents hoped that the memorials would serve as vigilant reminders of past oppression and unwavering guardians of rights won. Should those rights come under attack, or should new struggles arise, the memorials would connect the past to present-day battles.\n\nYet completed memorials, usually the products of compromise, are often less frank about injustice than what their creators had hoped. And civil rights memorials have not been immune from such compromise. Indeed, Congress ratified the holiday during the Reagan presidency, subjugating it to the dictates of people who had once denounced King when he lived. The holiday had to meet their approval, given only after King had been deradicalized.\n\nTo win the holiday fight, activists downplayed these uncomfortable truths, instead arguing that King's \"victorious\" crusade merited commemoration. They molded a positive consensus, emphasizing an uplifting and unifying King image, ripe for co-option by all. That Americans commemorated King's birth, not his death, contributed to the positive feeling.\n\nAll told, it is reasonable to wonder whether such memorials support or undercut the struggle for racial and economic justice. But despite their limitations, memorials do provide a forum to express dissent and even to help society move closer to the attainment of progressive goals. Civil rights memorials challenge the predominance of memorials honoring the Confederacy . Martin Luther King Day provides an annual platform to highlight King's lesser-known works and words and denounce the misuse of King's legacy.\n\nKing Day is an evolving and dynamic memorial that can affect and reflect society. Though people cannot touch it like a statue, the holiday is unrestricted by a specific location and so can be observed almost everywhere. Its righteous message can transcend state and even - true to King's internationalism - national borders.\n\nAdapted from Living the Dream: The Contested History of Martin Luther King Jr. Day by Daniel T.

And not only on the Right.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe only thing more predictable than riots in the United States' dilapidated cities is the outpouring of moralizing pseudo-explanations that accompany them. In this, as in so much else, Ferguson has been no exception. Between riffs on the venerable trope of \"outside agitators,\" commentators groping for an explanation of the uprising have seized on another, equally well-established mythology: the idea of a culture of poverty among black Americans.\n\nRacists began blowing on this particular dog-whistle as soon as the murder of Michael Brown began to attract national attention. No doubt in the coming months it will only get louder. As the sheer scale and brutality of racial inequality in the US comes, however hazily, into popular focus, conservatives across the country will, much like Zionists suddenly concerned with the fate of the Syrian uprising, suddenly evince an intense preoccupation with the lives of black Americans. We will hear how welfare has made blacks dependent on the government, has broken up the black family, and has encouraged a culture of criminality and violence (as evidenced by all that rap music).\n\nVariations on that basic narrative have, of course, become the norm in the language favored by the Right whenever it's confronted with questions of racism. But the influence of the culture of poverty thesis extends far beyond the ranks of Republican officials, Tea Party activists, and Fox News talking heads - apparent, for instance, in the near-universal tendency to turn any discussion of the pervasive inequalities and discrimination suffered by African Americans into a moralizing sermon about the cultural pathologies of black people.\n\nThe New York Times led the way in this regard, sagely informing its readers that Brown was \"no angel\" and detailing accusations that he had committed petty theft and fought with his family. The article went on to say that Brown \"lived in a community that had rough patches, and he dabbled in drugs and alcohol. He had taken to rapping in recent months, producing lyrics that were by turns contemplative and vulgar. He got into at least one scuffle with a neighbor.\"\n\nEven in those venues where this kind of attack on the character of a murdered young black man is recognized for the victim blaming it is, there is a reticence to directly confront the larger claims the culture of poverty theory makes about African-American culture. One can find any number of articles responding to the latest coded racism from the loud Republican of the moment, which point out how conservatives ignore the history of racial oppression and blame the black poor for their own suffering. Far more rare, however, is a direct confrontation with the description of black culture entailed by the culture of poverty narrative.\n\nThis is ironic, because every aspect of that narrative has been subjected to withering criticism by social scientists over the last thirty years. It is not simply that the aspects of black culture that the narrative identifies have been shaped by structural forces like racism; for the most part, they either don't exist at all, or else are reflective of norms and values that are commonplace in the United States - and are not, therefore, unique features of the \"black community.\" Every component of the culture of poverty narrative is a phantasm, a projection of racial fantasies on to the culture of African Americans, which has for several centuries now served as the screen on which the national unconscious plays out.\n\nPut more bluntly, they are lies.\n\nTake, for example, the claim that black youth inhabit a culture that venerates criminality, in which having been incarcerated is a matter of pride. This particular trope has seen heavy circulation in the last few years, trotted out to rationalize every death of a young black man at the hands of the police or vigilantes. Constructed out of a conglomeration of supposedly \"thuggish\" photos, snatches of rap lyrics, or social media ephemera, it works to make respectable the narrative that, in every case, it was the black teenager who threw himself in a fury at the men with guns. Confronted with such deep-seated criminality, the pundits innocently ask, what else were the police supposed to do?\n\nEthnographies of returned prisoners and their families reveal a very different world, one that coincides more with the commonsense notion that people who already face discrimination in the labor market would hardly celebrate events, like incarceration, that will make their lives even harder. Donald Braman spent four years conducting interviews with prisoners, ex-prisoners, and their families in the Washington, DC, area, and found that black families regarded incarceration with anything but pride.\n\nInstead, he found a pervasive sense of shame. Families of those in prison hid the truth from even their extended family, and went to great lengths to conceal the fact from their social circles. In interviewing close to fifty families, Braman reported that not one was \"out\" as having a member in prison to their entire extended family. Reading the stories he collects, one gets a sense of a suffocating stigma, a desperation not to be associated with the prison system in any way.\n\nIn light of Braman's work, the claim that young black men are happy to be locked up is perverse. There is no culture of criminality in black communities. Convenient as it may be to ascribe one to the victims of state violence, all of the evidence suggests that black families work incredibly hard to keep their members out of prison, and feel a profound sense of failure when they are unable to. In fact, compared with white families, black families place an even greater emphasis on following the rules and obeying authority . Given the disproportionate consequences black youth face for their transgressions, this differential is hardly surprising. Yet the disseminators of this lie persist, attempting to convince the nation that African Americans are (\"culturally, not biologically!\" they hasten to add) simply unable to assess even the most brutally obvious consequences of their actions on their lives.\n\nThe disconnect between claims of a culture of criminality and the evidence presented by reality is not at all unusual when it comes to the various elements that make up the culture of poverty narrative. Its other facets are equally guilty of inverting the world in which we live. Consider three prominent claims made by the would-be augurs of black culture: that black students devalue education out of a conception of school as a white thing, that black parents place a low value on marriage and a stable family life, and that the black poor are simply uninterested in finding work. All of these have been given voice across the political spectrum, from liberals to reactionaries, and all of them are patently false.\n\nThe notion of a black disdain for school as a \"white thing\" has been given voice recently by Barack Obama himself. Giving an address for his neoliberal \"My Brother's Keeper\" program, Obama took the opportunity to opine that in black communities \"there's been the notion of 'acting white,' \" where high-achieving black students are stigmatized by their peers. Obama was relatively restrained in his invocation of \"acting white theory,\" as it's called, confining himself to the assertion that it exists and is wrong, insofar as doing well in school does not compromise one's racial authenticity.\n\nThe very fact, however, that the president felt the phenomenon was important enough to comment on suggests that he thought black attitudes on this question were skewed enough to warrant correction. Other commentators have been even bolder in their use of the theory, trotting it out to explain that black attitudes, and not white racism, are the cause of black-white educational disparities.\n\nDespite its ubiquity in popular discussions, however, acting white theory has come under sustained criticism from education scholars. As social scientists have attempted to test the theory, they have found over and over that black and white students' attitudes on education do not differ substantively. Black students, just like their white counterparts, express a desire to do well in school, and report higher self-esteem when they succeed.\n\nIn fact, recent research by Ivory Toldson suggests that it is white male students who express the most ambivalence about the impact of good grades on their social standing. By contrast, 95% of black female students reported that, if they did really well in school, they would be proud and tell all of their friends about it. Similarly, black students were most likely to report that their friends would be happier if they went to college than if they didn't. Most white students said their friends wouldn't care either way.\n\nIn light of this body of research, the attempt to pin responsibility for educational inequality on black students themselves is beyond perverse. Black students, understandably, place a higher premium on education than white students, because they know they will pay a higher price for lacking it than white students will. Yet the aspirations of black students, however well-documented, fail to make any impact on discussions of race and education in national media. White talking heads (and black conservatives, it must be said) feel no qualms whatsoever about loudly condemning the youth of an entire race for lacking ambition, while remaining criminally silent themselves on the structures that actually frustrate black students' real and dearly-held ambitions.\n\nThe story is, if anything, even nastier when it comes to marriage and the family. Lamentations over the decline of the black family, in particular, are something of a national ritual in the United States, and have been for decades. In the inner city, we are told, there is a culture of single parenting, and having children with multiple partners. From here, descriptions of that culture frequently veer into the luridly racist, with \"broodmares\" being one epithet of choice for black mothers. This culture is then held to be at the root of any number of problems, as absent fathers are blamed for black children doing poorly in school or getting in trouble, and mothers dependent on welfare programs inducing a \"culture of dependency\" in their children.\n\nOnce again, this narrative is profoundly mistaken. Historically, as Herbert Gutman pointed out decades ago, black Americans have placed a tremendous value on maintaining family structures, and have actually had a lower divorce rate than white Americans. Since the 1960s, it's true that single-parent households have become far more common in black communities (though not only there), and this is the era commentators typically focus on, blaming the loss of a mythological united community under Jim Crow in more liberal versions of the story, or welfare programs in more reactionary ones. Both, however, see a transformation in black attitudes as central.\n\nBut social scientists working on family structures, however, have found that variables like the ratio of employed men to women are far stronger predictors of what families look like than attitudes are. When the supply of employed, non-incarcerated men is controlled for, black and white marriage rates look more similar than different.\n\nAttitudes towards marriage also display no great divergence between black and white Americans. Most black Americans value marriage highly, though, as is the case with whites, men tend to value it more highly than women. This last datum is particularly ironic, given the pervasive scapegoating of black men for supposedly abandoning their children after conception. In fact, as numerous studies have found, black fathers maintain high levels of contact with their children even when not co-habitating with the child's mother, and express a strong desire to be even more present in their children's lives. Even more significantly, as Kathryn Edin has noted , \"African Americans' higher valuation of marriage relative to that of whites narrows the racial gap in marriage.\" Black culture is responsible for the gap in marriage rates being smaller than it otherwise would be, not larger.\n\nWith this in mind, the recurrent political fantasy of addressing inequality in the US through marriage promotion programs aimed at the black poor in particular is a sick joke. If people like Sam Brownback, who wrote one of the most recent such proposals , actually cared about the marriage rate among poor black Americans, he would address himself to ending things like mass incarceration and the endemic joblessness in American cities, which all the evidence suggests play a massive role in disrupting black attempts to form stable nuclear families. The irony, of course, is that his preferred alternative is predicated on attempting to sell something to African Americans that they have been trying for literally centuries to buy at a price higher than he could possibly imagine.\n\nOne final component of the culture of poverty, and in some ways the most central, is the myth that the black unemployed simply don't want to find work. This was given particularly vulgar voice recently by Samuel \"Joe the Plumber\" Wurzelbacher, whose relentless self-promotion is indeed a monument to what hard-working white ethnics, with the help of a complicit media, can achieve. Commenting on the protesters in Ferguson, he suggested that the best way to disperse the demonstrators would be to hold a job fair, at the sight of which they would \"scatter like leaves.\" Though the sheer contempt for the black poor may be more visible in Wurzelbacher's quip than in other instances, in substance it doesn't differ in the least from Republican wunderkind Paul Ryan's pronunciation that inner city men simply don't appreciate the value of work.\n\nThis conceit has suffered perhaps more thorough rebuttal than any other component of the culture of poverty. Since the 1960s, social scientists have produced study after study demonstrating that poor and unemployed black Americans have basically the same attitudes towards work as the rest of country. In fact, a recent study found that black job seekers are even more resilient than their white counterparts, staying in the job market longer despite persistent frustrations of their search for employment. One waits in vain for such results to generate a moral panic over the decline of a work ethic in white communities.\n\nWhen it comes to the notion of welfare dependency, the verdict is much the same. One study looking at black single mothers in Milwaukee found that these women's families were a major contributor to the high value they placed on education and finding a career. Far from being the transmission belt of a \"culture of dependency,\" black families act as a support network encouraging their members to achieve as much as possible. The same study found that women on welfare, almost to a person, \"hated it\" and wished they could leave the program. However, the demands of childcare, combined with a lack of job opportunities, ensured that leaving was difficult for most.\n\nOther studies have found similar results, with welfare being largely stigmatized in black communities. In fact, a number of studies have found that people on welfare, black Americans included, feel that people take advantage of the system and receive benefits when they should not. Here, the constant demonization of people on welfare has had an effect on welfare recipients themselves. While attributing their own use to structural factors such as discrimination and joblessness, they attribute others' use of the system to laziness (importantly, however, this suspicion does not carry over into political support for attacks on welfare state, which are consistently opposed by people receiving benefits). The distance from the popular portrayal of black communities content to remain on the dole could not be clearer.\n\nAll of this is to suggest that the constant projections onto some kind of collective black psyche obscures the fact that African Americans and white Americans are motivated by much the same things. Still, the absence of evidence for their existence hasn't prevented these tropes of black cultural pathologies from entering into nearly every discussion of \"race relations\" in recent years. Indeed, belief in a black culture of poverty has become so entrenched that it is accepted without question for the most part. The prevalence of those assumptions are inseparable from the dominance of a politics that rejects structural solutions for the social disparities and entrenched discrimination facing African Americans, in favor of an emphasis on community self-help and personal responsibility.\n\nThus, we find ourselves in a situation in which public discussion of problems related to high rates of joblessness, child poverty, infant mortality, and many negative social indicators among African Americans is largely restricted to exhortations for a transformation of behavioral norms and attitudes. Instead of a political agenda to deal with pervasive disparities in wealth, educational opportunities, access to employment, and the like, we're told that upward mobility for African Americans depends on the inculcation of values that promote success; black communities, this approach suggests, must learn to celebrate family, encourage hard work, and embrace education.\n\nNot full employment but individual initiative and a commitment to advancement through low-wage work and job training will boost chronically low employment levels. Not a substantial program of redistributive reforms but incentives to encourage entrepreneurship will boost the resources of the black community. Not strengthened anti-discrimination measures or equal access to health care but altered lifestyle choices, better parenting, and the influence of positive role models will reduce health disparities and improve social outcomes for black kids.\n\nImplicit in all this is the idea that if African Americans have failed to overcome the racial stratification of American society, the reason is to be found - at least in large part - in the cultural and psychological character of the black community. The result has been the diffusion of a language around \"race\" that mirrors the \"color-blind\" racism associated with the post-Civil Rights era - a language that simultaneously downplays the significance of actual discrimination while stigmatizing African Americans for behaviors that go unremarked upon in the case of white Americans.\n\nIt is, for instance, not uncommon for conversations that are ostensibly addressing issues like mass incarceration and police violence to devolve into criticism of the dressing habits of young black men or the hedonism and violence in rap lyrics. The double standard at work here should be obvious: no one, for instance, questions whether the predilection of white teenagers for personal attire that can range from the bizarre to the obscene shouldn't make them the objects of scrutiny by police or potential employers. Bill Cosby's rant attacking black Americans for everything from the linguistic habits of black teenagers to the names given to black children was treated by everyone from Barack Obama to Bill O'Reilly as a serious call for self-reflection by the \"black community.\" Yet it would be impossible to imagine a situation in which the personal appearance and lifestyle choices of attendees at the annual Burning Man festival would ever inspire such anxiety.\n\nThe upshot is that even sympathetic observers tend to interpret concerns about deprivation and social disorganization through the prism of cultural or psychological damage. That dynamic is particularly evident in our proclivity to attribute problems like crime or violence in black neighborhoods to ill-defined features of black men's emotional existence. As a consequence, responsibility for these issues is commonly attributed to such causes as a lack of self-regard among African-American males, their purportedly nihilistic and myopic worldview, or their orientation on short-term, narrowly self-interested gain over long-term ambition and social uplift.\n\nThat tendency to speculate about the emotional or psychological state of young black men is emblematic of the way that \"race\" functions in America. In translating discussions of questions like crime and violence into explorations of group psychology, we effectively shift the focus from the social context for street violence in lower-income, predominantly black urban areas to the character of black people. That not only reinforces a blame-the-victim politics that refuses to acknowledge racism - embodied in the cynical use of the category \"black on black crime\" to dismiss concerns about police violence during the Ferguson protests - it also leads to a distorted view of the sources of elevated violence and chronic insecurity in black neighborhoods.\n\nPart of the reason that the trope of \"black on black crime\" has garnered such traction is because it feeds on very genuine concerns about issues like the high levels of violence crime suffered by some black communities. While homicide rates have declined precipitously across the US over the past two decades, the devastating number of shooting deaths suffered by black residents in cities like Chicago has received national attention in recent years. Confronted with the destructive effects of gun violence, many observers have interpreted it as a reflection of deep-seated social pathologies - the inverse of the racism of the US criminal justice system.\n\nResearch suggests that violent crime rates are driven by a variety of social factors which tend to make American cities particularly prone to gun violence against black residents. Among the most of these factors are very high levels of neighborhood segregation, concentrated un- and underemployment , poverty and a dearth of adequate social services or institutional resources . Fundamentally, gun violence has to be treated like other kinds of public health problems - not as the basis for continuous, empty calls for an introspective discussion about \"black on black violence.\" And like other kinds of public health disparities , tackling high rates of inter-personal violence requires confronting the social context in which it occurs.\n\nAnd yet, the culture-of-poverty narrative leads us away from that perspective, and exacerbates the widespread tendency to view social inequality through the lens of personal responsibility and cultural predispositions.\n\nGiven that the culture of poverty argument today is most strongly associated with the Right, it is surprising to learn that its provenance actually comes from the other end of the spectrum. The phrase itself achieved notoriety with Daniel Patrick Moynihan's famous report on the black family (\" The Negro Family: The Case for National Action \"), though he had himself drawn it from anthropologist Oscar Lewis' work. In the decades since then, as \"the Moynihan report\" has, quite properly, come to serve as shorthand on the Left for a pathologization of the black family and a victim-blaming rhetoric, it has been easy to forget that Moynihan himself was no Strom Thurmond, but a Great Society liberal with impeccable credentials. The concept itself comes not from the Right, which was then still mired in explicitly biological racism, but from liberals cognizant of the injustice of inequality, but too attached to ideas of black deficiency to jettison them entirely.\n\nAs American liberalism has moved steadily rightward since the 1970s, versions of the culture-of-poverty thesis have gained increasingly traction. In Moynihan's time, these sorts of ideas were counterbalanced by a liberalism that genuinely sought the expansion of the American welfare state. Hubert Humphrey, running for president in 1968, promised to hire a teacher for every policeman Richard Nixon wanted to hire, and build a house for every jail George Wallace wanted to build. By the 1990s, this sort of commitment had nearly disappeared from American liberalism, leaving culture of poverty arguments hegemonic. The importance of the culture-of-poverty approach is that it allows for recognition of the accumulated history of racism and inequality, but posits the ongoing effects of these as mediated through black cultural pathologies. It therefore permits American liberals to identify with opposition to racism while pushing them towards policy solutions geared towards the transformation of black people, and not American society.\n\nToday, these ideas are given voice by all manner of actors residing left of center on the political spectrum. Barack Obama's few engagements with the subject of racial inequality all draw on the idea of a culture of poverty, even if never explicitly named as such, from his condescending hectoring of black fathers to his gross suggestion that too many black parents feed their children fried chicken for breakfast. Jonathan Chait has also recently revealed himself to be an adherent, criticizing Ta-Nahesi Coates' recent writing for being insufficiently attentive to the deficiencies of black culture.\n\nThe Reverend Al Sharpton gave a particularly abhorrent reminder that conservatives have no monopoly on the culture of poverty at Michael Brown's funeral. In his eulogy , Sharpton lectured the assembled audience on the need for greater personal responsibility in the black community: \"We have got to be outraged by our disrespect for each other, our disregard for each other, our killing and shooting and running around gun-toting each other,\" he said, \"so that they're justified in trying to come at us because some of us act like the definition of blackness is how low you can go. . .\" In contrast to earlier generations of African Americans, who were presumably more worthy of equal rights, black people today exhibit a proclivity for bad behavior and bad manners, Sharpton said, concluding \"Now, you want to be a n-- and call your woman a 'ho.' You've lost where you're coming from.\"\n\nFor many on the Left, it's easy to recognize how backwards and self-defeating this kind of rhetoric can be. In shifting the locus of responsibility for the deep-seated inequities of American capitalism to the very people who are the victims of its greatest injustices, Sharpton is playing into the hands of the white conservatives who so often attack him for playing the \"race card.\"\n\nAnd yet the notion that the entrenched racial disparities of US society are, at least in part, the product of black cultural pathologies, retains enormous traction. Sharpton and Cosby are hardly alone among black Americans in identifying with versions of this narrative. A recent survey , for example, revealed that black men both tend to value education and work highly, yet thought that other black men spent too much time thinking about sports and sex. So pervasive is this ideology that people who know it to be false of themselves are willing to believe it of others. The argument can also take a more nationalist register, as in the contention that slavery damaged black American culture so profoundly that the resulting cultural deficiencies, often identified as a lack of community or self-respect, explain aspects of black inequality today, from educational disparities to economic impoverishment.\n\nForty years ago, both black nationalism and American liberalism existed in forms that looked squarely at the basic structure of American society for an explanation of racial inequality. The shift of both these ideologies away from that orientation in subsequent decades is in line with the larger retreat of the Left away from structural solutions and into more local and personalized projects. Effectively, the Left's horizons have shrunk in tandem with its social power.\n\nWhen it comes to race, however, this retreat has had particularly pernicious effects. The shrinking of ambition to the personal level here has resulted in a convergence with the kinds of victim-blaming narratives peddled in official \"colorblind\" ideology. When liberals or black nationalists agree that black crime contains some larger meaning about the state of the black community, they make the work of racist ideologues easier. They reinforce the basic point that black crime must be agonized over as a barometer of the cultural values of the race, while white crime may be treated as a normal aspect of a complex society.\n\nIn doing so, they give succor to those who seek to block any attempt at addressing the real causes of racial inequality, while rendering half-hearted and tenuous those attempts still being launched from within American liberalism itself. And all on the basis of ideas that, for all liberals' supposed commitment to reason and moderation, are no more connected with reality than birther fantasies.\n\nLike so many other \"zombie ideas\" in our current moment, the culture of poverty narrative persists not because of its success in explaining reality, but in spite of it. What it does succeed in doing is providing an explanation of reality that salves the consciences of the powerful and their supporters. Unfortunately, in an era when collective action by the oppressed is still far too sporadic and ephemeral, these kinds of explanations have sunk deep roots, into both layers of left-liberal opinion and oppressed groups themselves.\n\nYet what the social science literature demonstrates is that however secure the culture of poverty seems as a hegemonic explanation for racial inequality, it ultimately rests on what are, at the end of the day, nothing more than lies. As the uprising in Ferguson has highlighted the connection between American imperialism and militarism on the home front, it is worth remembering that cultural explanations of structural processes have never been a purely domestic affair.\n\nCommenting on the horrific death toll of the Vietnamese during the American war on Vietnam, William Westmoreland infamously explained to an interviewer that \"the Oriental doesn't put the same high price on life as does a Westerner. Life is plentiful. Life is cheap in the Orient.\" For a long time, this remark epitomized the racism of the war. We should view cultural explanations of inequality with the same contempt.\n\nPaul Heideman holds a PhD in American studies from Rutgers University-Newark.\n\nJonah Birch is a visiting assistant professor in sociology at Appalachian State University and a contributing editor at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But explaining Reagan and the Right requires more than a catalog of the absurd.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe 1976 presidential primaries were entertaining as hell. In response to Jimmy Carter's unexpected rise to the top of the pack of Democratic candidates, fascinated yet confused reporters wrote about the Southern evangelical society from which Carter came \"as if it were as alien to American culture as a Balinese cockfight.\"\n\nThe chief attraction of the 1976 primaries, of course, was Ronald Reagan, the Midwest radio sports announcer turned Hollywood B-list actor turned California governor turned conservative icon. Nobody was more quotable.\n\nA few years earlier, in response to people attempting to fulfill the demands of Patty Hearst's kidnappers by donating groceries to impoverished Californians, Reagan revealed his true feelings about the poor: \"Sometimes you wonder whether there shouldn't be an outbreak of botulism.\"\n\nReagan's growing army of zealots gave good press, too. His Florida campaign chairman, a larger-than-life car dealer, told reporters: \"If I was going to give the world an enema, I'd insert the nozzle in Washington.\"\n\nThe joy of reading Rick Perlstein's new book The Invisible Bridge: The Fall of Nixon and the Rise of Reagan - the third in his ongoing saga about the rise of the American conservative movement - is found in such gritty details. Perlstein is perhaps our best historian of American hyperbole. He is the master excavator of the politically absurd.\n\nWhere else can a reader discover that in 1974, the seventy-four-year-old chair of the House Armed Services Committee F. Edward Hebert, a long-serving conservative Democrat from Louisiana, demanded that Pat Schroeder, the only woman on the committee, and Ron Dellums, the only African American, share a seat? Such is Perlstein's ironic method of showing how an old order reacted to coming into contact with a new one. It's both sensationalistic and understated.\n\nThe Invisible Bridge is over 800 hilarious and frightening pages about the short period from \"the fall of Nixon\" (Watergate) to \"the rise of Reagan\" (the 1976 Republican National Convention). \"The fall of Nixon\" part of this equation is self-evident: Watergate is the label for the host of Nixon administration crimes that, once revealed, brought down a presidency.\n\n\"The rise of Reagan\" part is less obvious: Reagan narrowly lost a fiercely contested race for the Republican nomination to President Gerald Ford, a loss that signaled to many pundits the end of a strange political career. (Perlstein brilliantly concludes this book - and foreshadows his next one - with an un-prescient quote from New Yorker political correspondent Elizabeth Drew in the wake of Ford's nomination: \"This is probably the end of Reagan's political career.\")\n\nBut in barely losing the 1976 nomination, Reagan lit the fuse of a growing right-wing coalition on the verge of ignition.\n\nThe Invisible Bridge is one of an expanding number of books about the 1970s, a decade that most historians now understand as a conduit from the liberal New Deal era to the conservative Age of Reagan. Jefferson Cowie's much-lauded Stayin' Alive: The 1970s and the Last Days of the Working Class explains the rise of conservatism as a failure of liberalism, especially the white-working-class liberalism of the labor movement, to reconcile the industrial unionism of the 1930s with the more multicultural social movements of the 1960s. Stayin' Alive is a cultural history of white-working-class resentment - Reagan explained by way of Archie Bunker and Merle Haggard - and as such lays some of the blame for Reagan at the feet of the white working class.\n\nIn contrast, Judith Stein's Pivotal Decade: How the United States Traded Factories for Finance in the 1970s argues that the most important factor to understand about that crucial decade was the political response to economic crisis - for instance, the focus on controlling inflation instead of fighting unemployment. In this way, Stein shifts blame away from the white working class and pins it squarely on policymakers and their corporate overlords. Merle Haggard and other cultural ephemera had little to do with Reaganism and what we now call neoliberalism.\n\nThe Invisible Bridge builds from these and other historical accounts, relying on plenty of cultural, economic, and policy history to explain how our contemporary world was born in the 1970s. But Perlstein mostly brings the reader's attention back to high political drama. National elections and high-profile congressional hearings are where Perlstein looks to understand historical change - to explain \"how Americans divide themselves from each other.\"\n\nSo how did Americans divide from each other? In the aftermath of Vietnam, many Americans joined the \"suspicious circles\" composed of those who had grown increasingly cynical about the American project. During the Watergate scandal, the suspicious circles grew by leaps and bounds and even came to comprise politicians such as Idaho Senator Frank Church, who held hearings on the CIA and its history of illegal operations that included assassinations of foreign leaders.\n\nIn the face of such institutionalized pessimism, most pundits assumed that, unless Republicans somehow distanced themselves from Nixon, Watergate spelled the death of the GOP. Thus the fact that Reagan barely fell short of capturing the Republican nomination from a sitting president a mere two years after Nixon's disgrace, though Reagan refused to criticize Nixon, even at the apex of Watergate, is remarkable. It is indicative that ground-shaking historical forces were at work.\n\nPerlstein makes clear that the suspicious circles helped shape post-Watergate America, but that they failed to carry the day. Instead, those who questioned the faith of American exceptionalism were overwhelmed by a larger number of Americans who submerged any doubts they had about their nation. Unlike their more pessimistic fellow citizens - those who looked Vietnam and Watergate squarely in the face - millions of Americans turned away from the national horror show.\n\nThese were the Americans who embraced cheap redemption in the form of a mythical past. These were the Nostalgic Americans. Reagan was their natural leader.\n\nReagan's autobiography perfectly situated him to guide the Nostalgic Americans. He had spent his entire life crafting narratives of simple redemption. Even when complex factors had made his life difficult, Reagan devised Hollywood endings. Perlstein writes:\n\nRonald Reagan was an athlete of the imagination, a master at turning complexity and confusion and doubt into simplicity and stout-hearted certainty. Transforming his life, first his own and then in others' eyes, into a model of frictionless ease - and fashioning the world outside him into a stage in which to display it - was how he managed to fly.\n\nTo take one example: Reagan's father was a drunk who had difficulty keeping jobs and thus moved his family from one small Illinois town to another. But in Reagan's telling of his childhood, his father's vices did not represent bad memories or complicated feelings. Rather, they served as object lessons in grit.\n\nOne night, after stumbling over his \"father flat on his back on the front porch,\" Reagan did what any plucky young American would have done: he accepted responsibility - he grew up - and \"managed to drag him inside and get him to bed.\" Perlstein quips: \"Good thing his father was passed out drunk, or else Ronald Reagan would not have had the opportunity to come of age.\"\n\nFor Perlstein, Reagan's \"stout-hearted certainty\" was a proxy for the nation's deepest longings. Perlstein uses Reagan's finely tuned public image, especially his fictionalized autobiography that matched the desires of Nostalgic Americans, to do his heavy analytical lifting. Reagan's persona explains the \"invisible bridge\" from Watergate to the triumph of the conservative movement. Just as Napoleon was to Hegel \"the world spirit on horseback,\" Reagan is to Perlstein \"a man on horseback\" sent to \"rescue\" his fellow Americans from the abyss.\n\nOf course, just as Napoleon's ambitions led to the Napoleonic Wars, evidence that the world was not as ready as Hegel to embrace Napoleon as its spirit, Reagan's agenda sowed discord. Hegelian Reagan was a divider, not a unifier.\n\nReagan works well as a stand-in for the spirit of the nation because he had always been polarizing. Some people who knew Reagan when he was a teenage lifeguard remembered him as a hero who rescued countless drowning children from the clutches of a wild river. Others were so turned off by Reagan's showboating you would have thought he waited for children to get sucked under by a strong current before saving the day. Likewise, some Californians loved Governor Reagan as the man who finally stood up to spoiled Berkeley protestors. Others loathed him for violating the constitutional rights of young American citizens. And so on.\n\nReagan's polarizing persona is Perlstein's latest explanation for \"how Americans divide themselves from each other.\" This is what Perlstein has done with all three of his lengthy volumes.\n\nIn his groundbreaking first book Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus , Perlstein is subtler in his analytical reliance on the personality of his primary subject. He carefully documents how multitudes of conservative activists across the country, especially in Orange County and other mushrooming centers of Sunbelt conservatism, were ultimately responsible for the right-wing takeover of the Republican Party that led to the 1964 nomination of the conservative senator from Arizona and the end of national comity.\n\nAnd he is in fact critical of earlier historians like Richard Hofstadter who relied upon reductionist psychological frameworks in order to dismiss Goldwater and his right-wing supporters as deranged and atavistic. And yet Goldwater's persona looms large. His portrait of himself as a rugged individualist symbolizes for Perlstein the shifting ideological terrain that led many Americans to reject a welfare state that they imagined was encouraging sloth.\n\nGoldwater liked to say that flying an airplane, which he did while serving in World War II, was \"the ultimate extension of individual freedom.\" Such a demonstration of willful ignorance highlights one of the many internal contradictions of conservatism that Perlstein delights in: \"He neglected to note that a pilot not hemmed in by the intricate regulatory apparatus of the skies may get only as far as the plane he collides with in midair.\"\n\nIn Perlstein's second book Nixonland: The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America , he ratchets up the psychological angle a few notches. Nixon's existential hatred for the dreaded Kennedys, and the east coast liberal elite more generally, stemmed from his experience as a young college man, when he presided over a club of plebian outcasts (\"Orthogonians\") that duked it out for campus supremacy with a rival fraternity of blue-blooded snobs (\"Franklins\").\n\nFor Perlstein, such a resentful worldview served Nixon well in a nation traumatized by the 1960s, in a nation where the majority opposed the Vietnam War but an even greater majority opposed the antiwar movement. The latter was Nixon's \"silent majority\" - his Orthogonians.\n\nThus we can sum up Perlstein's contribution to our understanding of the modern American conservative movement: Goldwater's rugged individualists gave way to Nixon's Orthogonians who then gave way to Reagan's Nostalgic Americans. These overlapping groups of conservative Americans, each successively larger, divided the United States, giving birth to the polarized America we now know.\n\nIs this a good way to understand recent American political history?\n\nIn order to evaluate whether or not Perlstein's argument about modern America makes sense, it's necessary to take a step back and examine why he thinks so many Americans joined forces with Goldwater, Nixon, and Reagan. Perlstein's kaleidoscopic approach to digging up and relating seemingly random bits of sensational news (Perlstein makes creative use of Google's newspaper archives to weave together chunks of news from large newspapers like the New York Times with bits from small ones like the Toledo Blade ), narrated in frenetic prose, implies a historical theory: he thinks an increasingly scary and imponderable world drove Americans bat-shit crazy. This in turn made them ripe pickings for right-wing demagogues.\n\nIt took Perlstein over 800 pages to write a history of four years because so many disturbing things happened during those years. The President spied on American citizens for political gain, got caught, and then repeatedly lied to the nation. His successor almost immediately pardoned him. Left-wing extremists kidnapped a beautiful young heiress, who then seemingly joined forces with her abductors in waging guerrilla war against the capitalist war machine.\n\nWhite conservatives in Boston violently protested busing, and white conservatives in West Virginia violently protested multicultural textbooks. In response to US and European support for Israel in the Yom Kippur War, OPEC issued an oil embargo that resulted in skyrocketing gas prices and shortages. The economy suffered from both inflation and a recession, defying the expectations of Keynesian economists everywhere. New York City went bankrupt. And thanks to suspicious journalists and emboldened politicians, Americans discovered that assassinating foreign leaders was a viable option in the CIA playbook. Weird and frightening times.\n\nBut were those years in American history uniquely weird and frightening?\n\nSeveral periods in American history are suitable for the Perlstein treatment. Imagine a Perlstein book on the years immediately following World War I. Coming on the heels of the Great War, which killed millions of people, and the Russian Revolution, which brought communists to power in a nation that spanned nine time zones, European-style unrest seemed to have landed on American shores.\n\nA general strike in Seattle and several bombings set off by anarchists, including one on Wall Street that killed dozens, led to the deportation of over 500 anarchists, socialists, and communists. Which all happened the same year that several members of the Chicago White Sox conspired to fix the World Series, besmirching the beloved national pastime.\n\nIn the half-decade that followed, the Ku Klux Klan grew by the hundreds of thousands in urbanizing northern cities, the secretary of the interior was the subject of sensational congressional hearings about how he accepted bribes from oil companies in exchange for cheap leases on land in Wyoming, and the small town of Dayton, Tennessee attracted the gaze of the nation when it put a biology teacher on trial for teaching evolution. Weird and frightening times.\n\nThe point is not to claim that things never change. But to rely on weird and frightening events to explain historical change in a weird and frightening nation like the United States - made all the more weird and frightening by the deeply embedded engines of capitalism and evangelical Christianity - is not the most effective way to frame an historical argument. Perlstein needs a better theory.\n\nThe years during and after the 1960s were a transformative period in American history because the cluster of social norms that had long governed American life began to give way to a new openness to different ideas, identities, and articulations of what it meant to be an American. The radical political mobilizations of the 1960s - civil rights, Black and Chicano Power, feminism, gay liberation, the antiwar movement, the legal push for secularization - destabilized the America that millions knew.\n\nAdd to that the world-changing power of an increasingly deregulated capitalism, and the forces of modernity, long bubbling beneath the surface of American culture, were unleashed. In response, conservative, traditional, normative Americans fought back with a vengeance.\n\nPerlstein hints around the edges of this more encompassing theory of recent American historical transformation. He writes about how the suspicious circles were invested in \"unsettling ossified norms.\" And yet such analytical clarity gets lost in Perlstein's manic narrative about Americans collectively losing their minds.\n\nPerhaps this is by design. Perlstein's unspoken assumption seems to be that sane people would never have elected Ronald Reagan their president. Americans did it twice.\n\nAndrew Hartman is professor of history at Illinois State University.

But accuracy isn't his aim - Levin wants a sweep of \"Marxists\" from every layer of American society, a 21st-century rerun of McCarthyist authoritarianism to attack the Left.\n\nFox News host and bestselling author Mark Levin. (Fox News)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nReview of American Marxism by Mark R. Levin (Threshold, 2021)\n\nA strange figure appears repeatedly over decades of testimony for the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC): the \"Marxism expert.\" One might expect such an expert to explain concepts of Marxist theory to the Congressional committee, even to demonstrate how they inspired alleged communist organizing. But that wasn't their role.\n\nMany of these \"experts\" said freely that they could not read Marx, that his works are incomprehensible. It might even be a bit deviant to admit anyone could understand such a radical theorist. The expert's role, rather, was to identify communists by their vocabulary and political concerns: \"progressive,\" or \"democracy,\" or \"racial chauvinism,\" all code words that must be unmasked.  They were there to point out witches, not discuss the finer points of witchcraft.\n\nMany have pointed out Fox News host Mark Levin's bestselling American Marxism has likewise, at best, a shaky grasp on his topic. Calling it a work of \"staggering ignorance,\" Zachary Petrizzo notes that Levin refers to the European Marxists grouped under the heading the \"Frankfurt School\" as the \"Franklin School\" on multiple occasions, even on live television . Levin also locates the origins of these masterminds of the American left in Berlin - not, as their name might suggest if he knew it, Frankfurt. There are other embarrassing errors, such as twice referring to the central Marxist concept of \"historical materialism\" as \"material historicism.\"\n\nThese errors go on and on. Yet pointing out that American Marxism gets its history wrong is like reminding a Nazi that a swastika is an ancient Hindu symbol. Like the anti-communism of red scares past, Levin's goal is not to explain Marxism, but rather to frighten readers that Marxism is the diabolical force behind otherwise laudable goals such as ending racism or preventing climate catastrophe.\n\n\"In America,\" Levin writes, \"many Marxists cloak themselves in phrases like 'progressives,' 'Democratic Socialists,' 'social activists,' 'community activists,' etc.... They operate under myriad newly minted organizational or identifying nomenclatures, such as 'Black Lives Matter' (BLM), 'Antifa,' 'The Squad,' etc.\" For Levin, these movements have not arisen from rising economic inequality or revulsion at racism, but are rather the product of sinister theories hatched by European Marxist intellectuals. They do not seek to solve problems, but rather are movements bent on \"weakening the nation from within; and ultimately, destroying what we know as American republicanism.\" Subversion, not survival, are the goals of social movements.\n\nAs a Marxist myself, I would love to take credit for one of the largest mass uprisings in American history and assume leaders like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez take orders from my Capital reading group. But Levin's assertion that Marxism forms the backbone of anti-racist organizing, black freedom struggles, or Bernie Sanders-style populism has little to do with any qualities of Marxism itself. Levin nowhere describes how the ideas of Frankfurt School philosopher Herbert Marcuse came to inform the worldview of Kimberlé Crenshaw, the legal scholar who coined the term \"intersectionality,\" or Derrick Bell, one of the founders of critical race theory (CRT), or how French post-Marxists like François Schneider came to inform either the Green New Deal or Hugo Chávez.\n\nFor Levin, research, even evidence of the barest kind, is not the point. Rather he asserts that Herbert Marcuse spawned critical race theory because Marcuse \"was urging the violent overthrow of American society\" that \"perpetuates oppression against the minority.\" Yet once this wordplay conflates Marxism with liberalism, the Frankfurt School with Al Franken, Levin is free to say anything: Marxism has \"been embraced and promoted by the Biden administration, the Democratic Party, the media, and institutions throughout our society and culture.\" It's the Communist Manifesto all the way from the White House down to the school house.\n\nLevin is uninterested in a history of organizations in any normal sense, nor a history of ideas in any normal sense. He is pursuing a history of evil thoughts, in which a revolutionary in one moment might infect a revolutionary in another with their virus. In presenting ideas in this way, Levin has much in common with J. Edgar Hoover's paranoid vision of communism, \"akin to disease that spreads like an epidemic,\" as he testified before Congress in 1947. For Hoover, like for Levin, those who are not explicit Marxists are more dangerous, as they may infect without even knowing they are spreading this sickness.\n\nA conspiracy so monstrous one cannot believe it exists, as Hoover said of the Communist Party. AOC, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, the Green New Deal are all unwitting agents of this conspiracy, the Typhoid Marys of Marxism: they spread the virus more effectively than a sicko Marxist professor like me precisely because, from Levin's worldview, they appear healthy.\n\nMuch like the \"Marxism expert\" of the Cold War Red Scare, we should think of Levin's Marxism as a functional rather than historical term. The term \"Marxism\" allows Levin to take movements that are responses to the lived realities of capitalism, racism, and sexism, and suggest they are foreign, outside of the body politic. Their purpose is not to secure freedom, but to spread disease. Ignorance is not a liability for Levin - it is a method.\n\nThere is something particularly American in not wanting to understand the people you set out to destroy. Unlike Edward Said's portrait of the British Orientalist who takes pride in mastering the cultures they set out to conquer, Americans have always taken a Calvinist attitude to the other, imagining them as demonic rather than simply inferior. For the early Puritan, the forest was a site of Satanic evil; for the anti-communist, Marxism was a kind of witchcraft, to be burned - or perhaps electrocuted - rather than incorporated or co-opted. For Levin, it doesn't matter that he is not aware of the difference between critical race theory and Western Marxism; it is a mark of his virtue, proof that he is untainted by its disease.\n\nAs I trudged through Levin's prose, I was not shocked to discover he draws inspiration from an original, conspiratorial source: the Jewish communist. There is of course a longer, perhaps inseparable, history of anti-communism and antisemitism. In Paul Hanebrink's study A Specter Haunting Europe: The Myth of Judeo-Bolshevism , he charts how Nazi Germany framed the Soviet Union not as a communist country in competition with an alternate mode of production, but a racially inferior Slavic nation ruled by clever, despotic Jews.\n\nCommunism, for Nazis, was a racial term, inseparable from the identity of those who practice it. The antisemitism of both the first and second American red scares traded in similar logic, with Jews accounting for both a lion's share of the leftist deportees from the 1919 Palmer Raids, and in some years under McCarthyism, as many as two-thirds of the defendants called before HUAC. The anguished efforts of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg to prove themselves patriotic Americans who loved baseball, Tom Paine, and jazz showcased exactly how un-American their persecutors who accused them of espionage for the Soviet Union imagined them to be.\n\nIn recent years, anti-communist and antisemitic conspiracy theories have been given a reboot. Holocaust denier William Lind helped circulate the term \"cultural Marxism\" to refer, as Levin does, to a conspiracy theory that Jewish Marxists fleeing Nazi Germany developed anti-racist and feminist theory as a means to undermine the United States. Radical Jewish intellectuals such as Marcuse, Theodor Adorno, even émigré noir filmmakers such as Billy Wilder, fashioned everything from feminism to femme fatales as a way to weaken the white American patriarch. In such a fallen state, so the theory went, the proles can finally take over.\n\nWhile Marcuse may be the Jewish enemy within, Levin couples social movement actors with external threats from without, such as migrants or Chinese communists as the means by which an already weakened nation may be assaulted at its borders. \"CRT's goals are reminiscent of Communist China's social credit system,\" he writes, connecting anti-racist theorizing to the imagined totalitarian Chinese surveillance apparatus to the \"cancel culture\" white conservatives experience online. And most dangerous of all, the Marxists intend to \"overwhelm and collapse the system\" with migrants who will \"change the nation's politics, demographics, and citizenry\" so that \"balkanization and tribalization are certain to destroy any country.\"\n\nIf that sounds vaguely familiar, it should: Robert Bowers famously blamed Jews for undocumented immigration shortly before his massacre in the Tree of Life synagogue, in much the same way Donald Trump Jr singled out Jewish financier George Soros for funding migrants to enter the United States. When we saw caravans of hungry refugees, they saw an invading army financed by Jewish subversives.\n\nIt should be noted that Levin himself is Jewish. I wish I could say that is surprising. In recent decades, the Jewish, ultranationalist far right has openly traded in antisemitic discourse, much like their gentile cousins. Yair Netanyahu, Benjamin Netanyhu's son, evoked Soros conspiracies and images of the \" Jewish merchant \" to defame liberal Israeli opposition. The far-right French Jewish writer and political commentator Éric Zemmour praised the Vichy government's Philippe Pétain , known to have collaborated with the Nazis to deport Jews to death camps. And recently, the right-wing Jewish publication Tablet Magazine editorialized that left-wing anti-Zionist \" un-Jews \" were a threat to the Israeli state, even the continuance of the Jewish people, in language that starkly resembled far-right discourse about Jewish communists.\n\nThis brand of antisemitism is not about the 6 million Jews who live in the United States, any more than Islamophobic images of turbaned terrorists are about Islam in any substantive sense. It is a discourse of racialized, conspiratorial power, in which the \"Jewish Marxist\" is not imagined as a member of their synagogue board, but rather a demonic figure on the haunted fringes of society.\n\nLest one finds a Jew using such language confusing, one should remember there is a long history of right-wing Jewish Zionists, from Theodor Herzl to the present, describing Jews in the diaspora as weak, sickly, neurotic, and responsible for their own demise during the Holocaust. Some prominent Jewish leaders during the Red Scare were quite willing to ascribe sinister motives to Jewish communists - even to support the execution of the Rosenbergs. While it is impossible to know how Levin understands his own Jewishness, it doesn't really matter. Far more important is how he identifies with oppressive systems of capitalism, militarism, and racism.\n\nIn that way, his obsessions are all of a piece: there is nothing surprising in his list of enemies, other than how total they are. He is against trans rights, as transgender people disrupt the institution of the nuclear family and its gender binary. He devotes an entire chapter to the Green New Deal with what he asserts are encroachment on property rights that would be fatal to both capitalism as well as the \"animal spirits\" of capitalism. In that sense, he is a true reactionary: any attempt at reform, however minimal, is by definition an insurrection, as it disrupts the sacred rights of property, patriarchy, and the nation-state. His is not the mind of a Tory but the paranoid vigilance of a totalitarian.\n\nAmerica is a paradise to Levin, \"the most diverse, beneficent, tolerant, successful, and free nation ever established by mankind.\" Anyone who says otherwise is a \"disgruntled\" adherent to a foreign ideology, who is \"jealous\" of those who can be successful in such a meritocratic system. As Priscilla Wald reminds us about fears of contagion, they imagine a healthy body politic into which a toxin is entered: activism can be imagined as a disease precisely because Levin imagines America as a perfect body, almost eugenic in its construction. Any deviance is not just a political difference in a democracy, but an infection in need of eradication.\n\nLevin concludes with a modest proposal: a wholesale sweep of \"Marxists\" from every layer of American society.\n\nEducators, administrators, and elected office holders - all need to be removed from their posts. Universities and schools should be defunded, as \"there is no good reason why taxpayers should pay Marxists to teach generations of students to hate their country.\" Vigilance committees should be elected on local schools to ensure that any teacher guilty of teaching critical race theory be fired.\n\nHe calls for increased criminal penalties for \"rioters\" and \"domestic terrorists\" such as \"antifa\" and \"BLM.\" He calls for charges to brought against such organizations under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, and for the IRS to be used to financially bankrupt them. Levin wants a twenty-first-century Red Scare.\n\nIt's important to remember that Levin is not just a kook in a bunker in the woods somewhere. He is firmly in the center of the Republican Party, having served in the Ronald Reagan administration before directing the Landmark Legal Foundation , a right-wing advocacy law firm that received funding from the Koch Brothers, Richard Scaife, and ExxonMobile.\n\nHe now has his own show on Fox News and has written more than one right-wing best seller. We would do well to understand Levin's call to demonize and then remove all political opposition from public life as a call for fascism - perhaps even more far-reaching than the original red scare, as at least nominal membership in the Communist Party was then required.\n\nOf course, one has to ask why such a sloppy, badly written, and wildly improbable book such American Marxism has sold hundreds of thousands of copies. While the Left has nowhere near its strength in the 1940s during a wave of strikes after World War II, the rise of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and the insurrections after the murder of George Floyd have, for the first time in decades, issued real challenges to the comfortable assumptions by the rich and powerful that everything can continue just the way it is.\n\nIf Levin had actually read Marcuse, he might know he is in a long tradition. As Marcuse writes in Counterrevolution and Revolt , the United States has long practiced \"preventative counterrevolution,\" singling out radicals, intellectuals, people of color, and the otherwise marginal for selective punishment, in those moments of upsurge when they attempt to fulfill democratic impulses that the nation was supposedly founded on.\n\nThe first Ku Klux Klan, the violent crackdown on the Industrial Workers of the World, the Red Scares after both World War I and II, COINTELPRO, and mass incarceration have all been preventative counterrevolutions, terrorizing just enough people so that the vast majority, for a time, fall back into line.\n\nThe United States has always simultaneously presented itself as a liberal democratic state while banning communists and socialists, restricting labor rights, surveilling and disrupting left organizing, assassinating revolutionaries of color - violence one would only expect under fascist or authoritarian rule. Levin writes that \"American Marxists\" are a \"counterrevolution\" against the American Revolution in his first sentence.\n\nIn a sense he is correct: insofar as the American Revolution was, in part, a defense of slavery and an expression of Manifest Destiny, such radical movements as Black Lives Matter and DSA are revolutions against such forms of American authoritarianism. They are not connected in the conspiratorial way Levin describes; rather, both are social-democratic impulses for freedom and justice that grow and learn from each other in a country that promises everything and provides little but prisons and debt.\n\nLevin's proposed counterrevolution occurs amid a global pandemic that the United States lacks the will to control and a crisis of global warming the elites have decided is too expensive to confront. Much in the same way the second Red Scare targeted communists, and then dismantled some of the more radical elements of the New Deal, so too does Levin's proposed Red Scare target Marxists as a means to assure no meaningful ecological, democratic, or economic reform can take place.\n\nWhile Levin's prescriptions at the conclusion of his book are ostensibly nonviolent - insofar as costing people their jobs and invoking anti-terrorism laws are nonviolent - his rhetoric hints at something more sinister.\n\n\"We have allowed the American Marxists to define who we are as a people,\" Levin rails at his conclusion. \"They defame us, slander our ancestors and history, and trash our founding documents and principles . . . they live off the sweat and toil of others, while they pursue a destructive and diabolical course for our nation, undermining and sabotaging virtually every institution in our society.\" For such parasites in the past, he reminds us that \"one generation after another has been willing to sacrifice everything, and so many have paid the ultimate price, in defense of this magnificent country and its founding principles from foreign enemies.\"\n\nLevin repeatedly brings up the many thousands of Americans who died and killed to protect the nation from Communism. In his final chapter, he lists all of the Americans who died \"fighting the spread of communism,\" from the tens of thousands in Vietnam and Korea, to even the thousands in the \"war on terror\" (who knew Al Qaeda read Marcuse?). These \"noble warriors\" who \"fought and died\" contrast the parasites who live off of the sweat and toil of others mentioned above. One gets the sense while reading that should democratic means fail, more extrajudicial methods might be on the table - and no loss of life would be too great for Levin.\n\nThere is, though, a real tradition of \"American Marxism,\" not just the make-believe version cooked up by Levin. That tradition can be found in the labor-syndicalism of IWW songwriters such as Joe Hill and in the radical democratic speechmaking of Eugene Debs .\n\nIt is in \"Solidarity Forever,\" which combines a lesson on the alienation of labor under capitalism with the anti-slavery hymn \"John Brown's Body.\" It is in the theorization of race, slavery, and capitalism in the work of W. E. B. Du Bois, Angela Davis, and Richard Wright; it is in the working-class feminism of Tillie Olsen and Emma Tenayuca; it is in the radical theorizing of race and class in the speeches of Fred Hampton and the analysis of American empire in Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) pamphlets by David Gilbert.\n\nAmerican Marxism understands itself as the product of radically uneven development, a despotic slavocracy combined with the most advanced industrial and cultural production; a violent and often united bourgeoisie on questions of empire, and a vibrant democratic culture of the grassroots.\n\nBut none of that finds its way into the book. The book is not about history, but about creating a template for a right-wing coup.\n\nAs bad as this book is, it's also a reminder that calls for mass antidemocratic action that could easily turn violent do not need to be elegant. Mark Levin's American Marxism is a call for the wholesale purging of intellectuals and left activists from civic life, undergirded by a structure and often-evoked history of patriotic violence. It is being read by thousands who may hear his call as more than an invitation to run for one's local school board to support another round of cuts to one's public university, or assault a leftist protester in the streets. Levin is not a serious intellectual, but his call to eliminate the American left is deadly serious.\n\nBenjamin Balthaser is associate professor of multi-ethnic US literature at Indiana University, South Bend.

New York World-Telegram / Library of Congress.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn recent days, a parade of white power players has descended on Brooklyn to denounce the Black Lives Matter movement. In dueling press conferences and TV appearances , they have tied protests to riots, riots to criminality, and criminality to economic calamity. In so doing, they have shifted the onus from the police to the policed.\n\nThis is one of the oldest tricks in the book. Long before broken windows, the partisans of law and order claimed that protests are bound to cause riots, and that riots are bound to cause violent crime and neighborhood decline. In the decades since the urban uprisings of the 1960s and 1970s, the myth of the \"riot effect\" has been deployed to rationalize the massive expansion of urban police forces and with it, the escalation of policing to the level of low-intensity warfare .\n\nFifty years after the Watts Rebellion , and more than four months after the first shots were fired in Ferguson, we continue to hear the same refrain. Here is Time : \"Can Ferguson Recover? The Lasting Economic Impact of Violent Unrest.\" USA Today : \"Some Fear Rioting May Seal Ferguson's Fate for Decades.\" And National Review : \"Businesses and neighborhoods may never recover from the present anarchy.\"\n\nThe recent revival of urban protest has prompted a revival of that hoary urban legend, in which property owners and officers of the peace are the hapless victims, while targets of state terror are the aggressors. The riot is made out to be the root of all evils, the rioter the source of all maladies. But the legend quickly unravels in the face of the facts.\n\nIn the 1960s, many white liberals responded to the riots in America's urban centers with measured condemnation, mixed with equally measured denunciations of institutional racism. They held the white power structure to be \"essentially responsible for the explosive mixture which has been accumulating in our cities,\" in the words of the Kerner Commission .\n\nOther white liberals professed that the trouble in the inner cities was the product of a \" tangle of pathology ,\" one which was \"capable of perpetuating itself without assistance from the white world.\" These Great Society liberals would soon find themselves in the company of law-and-order conservatives, who seized upon the writings of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and other liberals to buttress their contention that black America was to blame for \"urban decay\" and ghetto poverty.\n\nAlong with the \"culture of poverty\" mythology , the riot effect gave white conservatives a convenient cudgel to wield against Black Power and the New Left. The alleged link between urban disorder, violent crime, and economic decline appeared early and often on the campaign trail, beginning with Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign in 1964 and continuing with Ronald Reagan's gubernatorial run in 1966, Nixon's presidential bid in 1968, and the rise of the New Right in the 1970s.\n\nTen years ago, a pair of economists - one of whom was William J. Collins, later a senior economist in George W. Bush's administration - finally came up with some findings to endow the riot effect with a veneer of scientific validity. In a series of studies for the National Bureau of Economic Research, Collins and his collaborator found that the cities that experienced the most severe riots from 1960 to 1970 saw the most significant declines in family income, employment prospects, and property values from 1960 to 1980.\n\nOn its face, the story they told seems plausible enough: a riot occurs in a northern city with a high concentration of black residents. Other things equal, the riot will have spillover effects in the riot zone and beyond. These effects will be especially bad for black property owners. Insurance premiums will rise, shops will shutter, businesses will relocate, and there will be trouble in the municipal bond markets. The authors conclude that riots can best be described as \"shocks... propagated into 'bad ghettos.'\"\n\nSome of the most celebrated writers on the Right later expanded on the theme by arguing it wasn't structural racism, but rioters (read: black people) who were to blame for the growth of the racial wealth gap . More recently, the story has been trumpeted from the talk show circuit to the front pages of newspapers , the dismal scientists trotted out to dutifully explain to our reckless youth that \"rioting is a terrible deal.\"\n\nBut the \"riot effect\" narrative contains a fatal flaw betrayed in the terminology itself: it rests on the assumption that \"riots\" are essentially random occurrences. For those who blame black America for black poverty, riots are distinguished not by their contingency or their spontaneity or their political cast, but by their irrationality. On this misreading of history, civil resistance has nothing to do with the underlying conditions that make it rational to rebel, or with the relations of power that make other avenues of action unavailable to the urban poor.\n\nTo justify this assumption, the economists quote a forty-year old study purporting to show that \"the severity of a disturbance, as well as its location, appears not to have been contingent upon Negro living conditions or their social or economic status.\" And on the basis of this outdated observation, they see fit to eschew all alternative explanations for the condition of the black ghetto over the last several decades.\n\nWhat, then, are those alternatives? The first is an economic one. Serious social scientists have long linked the crisis in the cities to the collapse of their industrial base - the result of which has been a decline in demand for less-skilled labor and the growth and ghettoization of a surplus population. The effects of job losses have everywhere been disproportionately concentrated among black workers and black communities. In many of the \"riot cities,\" it is worth noting that the process of industrial restructuring predated the eruption of mass unrest by a decade or more.\n\nA second explanation centers on the role of institutionalized racism. Aptly labeled \" American apartheid \" by sociologists Doug Massey and Nancy Denton, the urban regime of residential segregation created a \"federally sponsored 'second ghetto' in which blacks were isolated by class as well as by race.\" Segregation went hand in hand with practices like redlining and blockbusting , driven by private developers, mortgage lenders, and the white elite. Such practices likely did more to depress property values than a riot possibly could. More importantly, they maintained a black ghetto wildly profitable for white capital.\n\nA third alternative links the fate of the inner city to the dynamics of class struggle in the North. Rebellions have tended to occur in cities where black workers also engaged in other forms of disruptive power, such as strikes and demonstrations. Riot or no riot, under such conditions , it is reasonable to assume that white business owners might feel compelled to take their money and run. It is also reasonable to assume that white politicians would be inclined to punish the rebellious poor with policies of planned abandonment .\n\nScholars differ on the forces and factors that explain the scope and severity of urban rebellions. But beyond the looking-glass world of neoclassical economics, there is a growing body of evidence that the consequences of such structural forces were far more significant, persistent, and pernicious than those associated with the alleged riot effect.\n\nWhat effect, then - if any - does this type of resistance actually have? One possible answer is that it gets the goods . Historically, there is some evidence to support this hypothesis: take Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward's work on poor people's movements , or Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson's research on democratization . But in the age of austerity, cities and states with rebellion are more likely to see resources redirected toward security services than social services.\n\nAnother answer could be that a riot provides a pretext for elites to do what they were going to do anyway. Business owners can take the opportunity to move out of a neighborhood, but they can just as easily take the opportunity to move in. State managers can use rioting as an excuse for planned abandonment, or they can use it as an argument for redevelopment - as they have done to great effect in gentrifying areas of Oakland , Brooklyn , Cincinnati , and elsewhere. On this reading, the riot effect is not only a ruse, but also a rationalization of existing interests.\n\nIt is as rational for communities capitalism deems superfluous to rebel as it is profitable for capital to keep them in their place. But when the apologists for this state of affairs turn to social science for backup, it is worth remembering that their claims to truth remain as questionable as their claims to legitimacy.\n\nMichael Gould-Wartofsky is the author of The Occupiers (Oxford University Press, 2015) and a PhD candidate in the department of sociology at New York University.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Kendi knows what true patriotism looks like\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Ja'han Jones\n\nIbram X. Kendi is among the names that white conservatives have homed in on in their yearslong crusade against Black educators and authors who address systemic inequality.\n\nHis book \"Antiracist Baby\" has reached the upper echelon of racist, angst-ridden politics, with its frequent citations by right-wing lawmakers perturbed that Kendi has the audacity to advise parents on how to avoid raising bigots.\n\nBut Kendi doesn't merely address the racist indoctrination of America's children . His work strips down the mythology built around the United States' Founding Fathers to reveal injurious self-interested men, and he nails down why it is that adults are so motivated to invest in this mythology.\n\nThat's why, for today's installment of \"Black History, Uncensored,\" our series celebrating Black authors targeted by right-wing bans, I wanted to highlight another work of Kendi's that speaks to the ethos underlying his writing. In his 2019 piece \"What to an American Is the Fourth of July?\" we're treated to all the things conservatives fear in the author.\n\nKendi begins the piece framing the Founding Fathers' ambitions of creating a republic as inherently exclusionary. He notes that John Adams' use of \"our Struggle\" in a 1776 letter to his wife, Abigail, suggested that the white guys who fought against British imperialism weren't concerned with many freedoms aside from their own as white men. In doing this, Kendi immediately contradicts efforts to portray these men as framers of true democracy.\n\nHe wrote: \"As we know all too well today, wealthy white American men did not stop rebelling when they won the American Revolution, when they gained the power to protect their declared independence. They continued to rebel to keep their power. They, 'the Patriots.' The rest of us have continued our rebellions because we have yet to gain the power to be free . The resisting rest of us, 'the unpatriotic.'\"\n\nAnd whereas many people - particularly, those who want to ban his work - conflate patriotism with silence about historical and ongoing mistreatment by U.S. institutions, Kendi encourages a different tact.\n\nIn his 2019 piece for The Atlantic, posted on the Fourth of July, he wrote:\n\nOn this Fourth of July, the rest of us - and our wealthy white male allies - should be celebrating our ongoing struggles for freedom and not celebrating as if we are free. We should be celebrating our disobedience, turbulence, insolence, and discontent about inequities and injustices in all forms. We should be celebrating our form of patriotism that they call unpatriotic, our historic struggle to extend power and freedom to every single American. This is our American project.\n\nRemember that this piece predates the 2020 publication of \"Antiracist Baby,\" which is to say, by the time Kendi's work became familiar to many conservatives, he had already established a body of work that strikes at the heart of right-wing pseudo-patriotism.\n\nAnd his reference to freedom as \"our American project\" indicates that Kendi and others have their heels dug in for an enduring fight. Given that, there's no mystery why many Republicans want his work hidden from American students.\n\nRead previous \"Black History, Uncensored\" posts about Mikki Kendall , Ralph Ellison , Zora Neale Hurston , Maya Angelou , Richard Wright , James Baldwin and more .\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

As many Black people can tell you, \"woke\" was dying as a relevant cultural term long before white conservatives came along. And even now, Republicans use the term to describe such a broad range of subjects that it's essentially useless as anything but a dog whistle telling conservatives not to like something.\n\nI thought Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., described this tactic beautifully Wednesday when he referred to it as a \"smoke screen\" used by Republicans when they want to slash funding.\n\n\"From behind this new catchphrase, Republicans want workers and families to line up behind the tax cheaters, behind the polluters, behind the campaign donors, behind the well-connected and the well-off whom they serve,\" Whitehouse said.\n\nHe added: \"Well, their problem is, you can say 'woke' for a while, but then people will notice that they no longer have disability benefits, or that they can't afford their prescription drugs, or that huge corporations are paying nothing in taxes. The 'woke screen' is a smoke screen and people need to see through it.\"\n\nWhile we're on the topic of Black colloquialisms, I have another to describe the senator's remarks: \" BARS! \"\n\n(I can't wait to see what Republicans do with that one.)\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

On Sunday, the presumptive Republican nominee for president delivered a speech at The People's Convention , a gathering in Detroit hosted by right-wing activist group Turning Point Action and its founder, conservative agitator Charlie Kirk. Ironically, the appearance came after an event where Trump portrayed himself as a political ally to Black voters .\n\nKirk and his associates are known for spewing racist bile from Kirk's podcast and their personal social media accounts. And, in fact, a viral video from The People's Convention shows some of those associates waving a flag and handing out hats with the phrase \"White Boy Summer.\"\n\nThe scene had the same absurdist feel as many right-wing events these days (which, for the record, I think is deliberate). But goofy as it may seem, this is not something we should take lightly.\n\nThis phrase, which the Anti-Defamation League notes has become become popular among white supremacists , first began as a variation of a statement of womanly pride by rapper Megan Thee Stallion. Megan popularized the phrase \"Hot Girl Summer\" in 2019 to promote women's independence and bodily autonomy. She faced misogynistic backlash for promoting these things, spurring some men to promote the phrase \"Hot Boy Summer\" as a cringeworthy competitor. Then, white men - such as Tom Hanks' son Chet - appropriated the phrase to create \"White Boy Summer\" as a declaration of their purportedly fleeting summertime freedom.\n\nAnd that's how we arrive in the present day, where the phrase \"White Boy Summer\" has become a way for white supremacists to promote what is essentially unhinged white hypermasculinity (and all the oppressive bigotry it represents). And that's why, as silly as it may seem to discuss, it's significant that the organizers of an event for the presumptive GOP presidential nominee would tout it. It certainly speaks to the true driving force behind Trump's campaign: white men.\n\nRelatedly, Media Matters just published an excellent report on the The People's Convention and how Kirk's Turning Point organizations carefully use popular figures and phrases linked to white nationalism - like \"White Boy Summer\" - to promote their ideas within the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign.\n\nYou can check the report out here .\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

My MSNBC colleague Steve Benen wrote a great piece about Trump's gutting of VOA and his broader attack on pro-democracy media outlets.\n\nThe Minority Business Development Agency was created during the Richard Nixon administration and has a self-described mission \"to promote the growth and global competitiveness of Minority Business Enterprises in order to unlock the country's full economic potential.\" Such programs have been under assault by white conservatives for some time, and Trump's closure of the agency can plausibly be seen as part of his perverse vow to address \"anti-white feeling\" as president, despite it not existing in any systemic form.\n\nA year ago, I wrote about a Trump-appointed judge's ruling that the program, which helps minority-owned businesses that have long faced discrimination and marginalization, must serve white people because it was effectively discriminating against them . And last week, I wrote about the Trump administration's demand that the city of Asheville, North Carolina, amend its Hurricane Helene draft recovery plan to remove a reference to assistance for businesses owned by minorities and women.\n\nThis entirely predictable scenario, in which Trump and his allies kneecap key government programs meant to aid nonwhite people, is precisely why I took an interest in reporting on Black philanthropy while writing for The ReidOut Blog back in 2021. Private giving and intra-communal investment among nonwhite people is not, in my view, an effective stand-in for the federal aid that minority-owned businesses deserve. Especially since minority-focused philanthropic organizations have faced \"lawfare\" from white conservatives, too .\n\nBut philanthropy and private investment are likely to become even more vital for minority-owned businesses under a Trump administration apparently dead set on dismantling federal tools that help these businesses survive and thrive.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

That's the bridge where, in 1965, state troopers with clubs and tear gas set upon a group of voting rights activists led by a young John Lewis . Two weeks later, federal authorities stood guard as Martin Luther King Jr. led activists across.\n\nThe affront is a poignant example of the phoniness of conservatives' invocations of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nDesecrating the site of one of the most spectacularly violent attacks on civil rights protesters by using it as a prop in an ad that denounces critical race theory was bad enough. But, then, in a move that was exponentially more audacious and disrespectful, Mandel accused Bernice King of being ignorant of her assassinated father's politics.\n\nThe affront is a poignant example of the phoniness of conservatives' invocations of Martin Luther King Jr. in their ongoing project to co-opt his legacy. It's an example of the way white conservatives mention him not in any sincere effort toward racial healing or reconciliation but to feed other white conservatives' insatiable desire to put Black people in their place.\n\n\"Martin Luther King marched right here,\" Mandel says in the ad, \"so skin color wouldn't matter.\" Then the ad cuts to photos of Mandel, who is white, posing with Black Marines in Iraq during America's unjustified occupation of that country. \"I didn't do two tours in Anbar Province, fighting alongside Marines of every color, to come home and be called a racist,\" he said. \"There's nothing racist about stopping critical race theory and loving America.\"\n\nThen a voiceover comes in: \"Josh Mandel - pro-God, pro-gun, pro-Trump.\"\n\nIt dishonors the memories of Lewis and King to promote an agenda that will bring nothing but more harm to Black people at a site where they struggled for Black people's advancement.\n\nIt's also illogical to pick a site where the law was so violently used to hold back Black people to dismiss a discipline that investigates the innumerable ways the law has done just that. On top of that, King, who won a Nobel Peace Prize, abhorred war for its destructiveness and because, he said, money spent on war is money that doesn't get spent helping the poor . Calling out his name in a proudly militaristic ad that idolizes guns and former President Donald Trump is an abomination.\n\nAnd there's no reason to believe that it wasn't a calculated abomination. Because Mandel wasn't done giving offense.\n\nThere's no reason to believe that it wasn't a calculated abomination. Because Mandel wasn't done giving offense.\n\nHe posted the video to Twitter, tagged Bernice King and claimed that a visit to Atlanta's King Center for Nonviolent Social Change , where King is CEO , had inspired his ad. When she correctly questioned his understanding of her father's beliefs, the 44-year-old Mandel argued back that Martin Luther King Jr. \"knew the importance of the Second Amendment\" and told the 59-year-old Bernice King: \" Study your history better .\"\n\nYou won't find any better evidence of the white American belief that Martin Luther King Jr. belongs to them, that he would approve of them more than he would approve of Black people and that white people, the authorities on what Martin Luther King Jr. believed, can invoke his name to scold Black people. Bernice King's twitter feed is filled with such arrogance: Random people contradicting her about her father and arguing that he'd take their side, not hers.\n\nGiven that Bernice King politely corrected a tweet from Mandel in September when he equated supporting critical race theory to \" stomping on the grave of Martin Luther King ,\" the probability that he tagged her Tuesday with a plan to talk down to her is about 100 percent. Because, in today's Republican universe, being ugly and racist and disrespectful is celebrated as being the sign of a fighter. \"You want a fighter,\" Mandel says at the end of his ad, \"send in a Marine.\" Mandel used the \"stomping on the grave of Martin Luther King\" language in a March 13 interview , a full six months after the man's daughter politely asked that he not \" use my father or his grave to increase fear regarding CRT .\"\n\nAfter that September exchange with the candidate, Bernice King tweeted: \"So many people who furiously and erroneously tell me what my father believed absolutely refuse to study his teachings beyond a few quotes . That's very telling and extremely unfortunate.\"\n\nBernice King didn't have to explain where the loud and wrong get their quotes. Most of America knows only one part of one Martin Luther King Jr. speech: the unwritten, unplanned coda to the political manifesto he presented at the March on Washington in 1963. And many white people misinterpret that segment as his opposition to seeing or mentioning race.\n\nBut Martin Luther King Jr. was clear on the race of America's oppressors. There are many quotes that attest to his clarity, and his daughter chose one to tweet Wednesday : \"[T]he problems in the world today, as they relate to the question of race, must be blamed on the whole doctrine of white supremacy, the whole doctrine of racism, and these doctrines came into being through the white race and the exploitation of the colored peoples of the world.\"\n\nShe said the fearmongering over critical race theory \"is aimed at banning all teaching of substance on past & current devastation of white supremacy/racism. It is cruel to quote my father, who was assassinated for working to eradicate racism, poverty & militarism, to facilitate that fear.\"\n\n\"Study your history better,\" Mandel said. He clearly hasn't studied his. But what's worse are the attempts by him and his fellow Republicans to keep everybody as ignorant as they are.\n\nJarvis DeBerry is an opinion editor for MSNBC Daily.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

The ruling by Judge Mark Pittman followed a lawsuit filed on behalf of white plaintiffs by the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, a conservative group.\n\nAs The Washington Post reported :\n\nIn a 93-page opinion rendered Tuesday, U.S. District Court Judge Mark T. Pittman ruled that the Minority Business Development Agency's presumption that businesses owned by Blacks, Latinos and other minorities are inherently disadvantaged violated the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection. He permanently enjoined the agency's business centers, which have assisted minority-owned businesses in accessing capital and government contracts, from extending services based on an applicant's race. \"If courts mean what they say when they ascribe supreme importance to constitutional rights, the federal government may not flagrantly violate such rights with impunity,\" Pittman wrote. \"The MBDA has done so for years. Time's up.\"\n\n\"Time's up.\" How cute - and how utterly detached from reality that little quip is.\n\nAs I wrote last June , the Supreme Court - by suggesting racism is a thing of the past in its rulings against affirmative action in college campuses admissions and against the Voting Rights Act - has given white people a legal pretext to jettison any guilt they may have harbored over systemic racism. This is a manifestation of white evangelicals seeking absolution of America's racist sins - not through God or good deeds, but through the gavel.\n\nSince those rulings, we've seen an effort to roll back racial progress in just about every arena imaginable. Edward Blum , the man who successfully sued college affirmative action into oblivion, has brought another suit before the Supreme Court that seeks to outlaw private philanthropy groups' race-conscious giving. Blum's organization is also trying to end affirmative action at West Point and other service academies. And it recently filed a lawsuit that claims the Smithsonian's Latino museum is practicing \"pro-Latino discrimination\" by offering an internship program geared toward Latinos.\n\nStephen Miller, the Donald Trump adviser who purports to fight \"anti-white bigotry,\" is crusading against diversity measures, as well. USA Today reported in December that Miller has filed \"about two dozen\" so-called reverse discrimination lawsuits, including a successful suit that stopped federal aid from going to minority farmers , a group that has historically been targeted by discriminatory policies. More recently, Miller's organization filed a lawsuit seeking to thwart efforts by broadcasters and production companies to diversify their writers' rooms.\n\nThe federal court ruling out of Texas and the numerous anti-diversity lawsuits nationwide collectively represent a broader right-wing movement against diversity: C onservative politicians are pressuri ng schools to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs on college campuses ; education officials are restricting what school's can teach about racism and discrimination.\n\nThe irony of claiming that systemic racism is a thing of the past is that by vigorously targeting Black and other under-represented group's participation in civil society - that is, by prioritizing white people's emotional comfort over genuine equality - these right-wing legal activists have brought that racist \"past\" into the present. And they've proven it to be just as much a scourge as ever.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger. He previously wrote The ReidOut Blog.

We need to talk about it.\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Ja'han Jones\n\nAcross the country, conservative propaganda is helping sell the Republican Party's claim that it's pro-parents .\n\nPolicies that would bar educators from teaching American history accurately or prohibit lessons on gender and sexual orientation are just some of the goals conservatives claim are a boon to parents.\n\nBut these GOP policies and a host of others are obviously anti-children, and I often wonder why they're not more widely condemned in media for their inevitable harm to America's kids.\n\nIn that way, this majorly white group is dodging condemnation Black parents often receive in the media : claims that they're unfit parents.\n\nThat needs to change. It's white conservatives who have a parenting problem.\n\nFor example, the GOP-led Florida Legislature passed a bill last week that would outlaw schools from teaching kids up to third grade about gender identity and sexual orientation. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he will sign the bill, which he claimed will ensure his kids aren't \"sexualized.\" Conservatives throughout the country are pushing similar laws.\n\nBut the purpose of those lessons isn't to \"sexualize\" children. These lesson plans teach kids about the existence of gender as an identifier and encourage tolerance regardless of one's gender or the people to whom they're attracted. Conservatives have children - yes, LGBTQ children, too - who deserve to know the real world includes people of various genders who are worthy of respect and love. Denying that fact doesn't make it any less true, but it does ensure many kids will grow up as paranoid and deluded about these topics as the people passing these laws.\n\nMississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, was in a similar situation Monday. Reeves signed a bill he said targeted critical race theory, the college-level field of study conservatives cite to fear-monger about school lessons on racism. Critical race theory is not usually taught in K-12 public schools.\n\nReeves claimed such lessons \"humiliate and indoctrinate\" kids. The bill he signed bars schools from teaching \"any sex, race, ethnicity, religion or national origin is inherently superior or inferior.\"\n\nOf course, one can safely assume lesson plans about racial inequality aren't claiming that any race is inherently inferior or superior. They teach racial tolerance while addressing the history of white supremacy in America.\n\nDenying this is harmful, too. Kids - white, conservative ones included - would benefit from learning about our increasingly diverse country and the ways it has historically benefited some groups at the expense of others. Ignoring this won't stop the justifiable demands for racial equality; it will just ensure many kids grow up mystified, confused and angered about them.\n\nConservative neglect for children doesn't end in the classroom. Conservative lawmakers' obsession with fossil fuels is actively worsening the environment American children will one day be forced to live in. And their opposition to social welfare policies like the child tax credit have dragged millions of children into poverty, as I've written in the past .\n\nThe conservative movement has had ample opportunity to show it cares about kids. It's time we all acknowledge its repeated failures on that front.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger. He previously wrote The ReidOut Blog.

The state's conservative leaders have been among the most rabid in the country with regard to banning books and trying to whitewash history .\n\nis for book burning, a popular practice in repressive societies that appears to be gaining in popularity among some conservatives .\n\nis for critical race theory , the high-level field of academic study that focuses on the way racism is systemic in the nation's institutions. Conservatives have sought to make the term toxic and use it as a catch-all reference to discussions - or in-school reading materials - about inequality, which they think should be banned from the classroom.\n\nis for discipline centers. Earlier this year, the Houston school system decided to eliminate librar ian positions and repurpose some school libraries into centers where students accused of misbehaving can be sent. The plan raised concerns about a de-emphasis on education and an overemphasis on punishment.\n\nis for ethnonationalism, a system of beliefs in which national identity is interwoven with a particular race or ethnic identity - such as \"whiteness\" - that is assigned supremacy over others.\n\nis for facts, or truthful statements. (Also: frequent targets of conservatives looking to whitewash history.)\n\nis for gay, a sexual orientation deemed by conservatives to be un mentionable in classrooms .\n\nis for hate, a motivator behind the incessant right-wing push to obscure accurate teachings of history.\n\nis for Illinois, the first state to ban book bans .\n\nis for James Baldwin, the famed Black author and frequent target of book bans . (Read Baldwin's thoughts on the threat Black perspectives pose to white supremacy here .)\n\nis for Kimberlé Crenshaw, the esteemed lawyer and scholar - and founding practitioner of critical race theory .\n\nis for Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson of North Carolina, a conservative extremist who has sought to ban books about LGBTQ people and has floated not teaching science and social studies until sixth grade.\n\nis for Moms for Liberty, the Florida-based extremist group. Its members often portray themselves as \"mama bear\" types , and they think censoring curricula is what's best for America's kids.\n\nis for neo-Nazis, the modern movement of people looking to carry forward the ideals of Germany's fascist Nazi party. Banning and burning books was popular with Nazis, and the rise of book bans in the U.S. appears to coincide with emboldened neo-Nazi groups in various parts of the country.\n\nis for the Ocoee massacre, in which Black Floridians were killed on Election Day in 1920 for exercising their right to vote. Under Florida's new education guidelines , students will need to be taught that such race massacres also involved violence from African American perpetrators - rather than being one-sided assaults on human and civil rights.\n\nis for PragerU, a conservative advocacy organization whose videos and other propagandistic learning materials have been approved for use in schools in Florida, Oklahoma and potentially Texas .\n\nis for queer studies, a field of academic study that focuses on the lived experiences of LGBTQ people. (Also: a target of Florida Gov . Ron DeSantis and other right-wing officials.)\n\nis for Ryan Walters, Oklahoma's superintendent of public instruction. His archconservative viewpoints have helped make him one of the most prominent education officials in the country .\n\nis for social-emotional learning, a teaching concept employed to help children learn to manage their emotions and practice empathy. SEL has come under fire from conspiratorial parents .\n\nis for Tom Horne, Arizona's superintendent of public instruction and arguably a pioneer of the movement to outlaw culturally inclusive education .\n\nis for unconscious, the preferred mental state of those who wish to obscure accurate teachings of social inequality (i.e., the opposite of \"woke\").\n\nis for Virginia, where Republicans arguably soft-launched their crusade against educational efforts to encourage diversity and equality.\n\nis for woke, a term created by Black people as a reference to cultural consciousness and awareness of social ills. White conservatives have appropriated it as shorthand for what they suggest - often, clumsily - is a ruinous state of being.\n\nis for xenophobia, the fear, hatred or distrust of people from other countries. Critics of book bans and repressive education policies argue that the right-wing efforts are rooted in xe n ophobic views of American exceptionalism .\n\nis for the youth, an apparent obsession of book-banning conservatives. In their messaging, Moms for Liberty chapters have been known to deploy a quote attributed to Adolf Hitler that refers to controlling the youth.\n\nis for zealot, a fanatical partisan. (Also: an apt descriptor of people who strive to block accurate teachings of history.)\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger. He previously wrote The ReidOut Blog.

It certainly describes Donald Trump , who launched his 2016 presidential campaign with a racist diatribe about Mexican immigrants. But we've seen multiple examples of this recently with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis , country music singer Jason Aldean and conspiratorial Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani .\n\nLet's take a look back, shall we?\n\nIn DeSantis' case, we've seen race hustling in his administration's efforts to whitewash the history of slavery. His support of Florida's new educational standards, which require schools to teach that slavery sometimes came with a personal upside for enslaved people , underscores his eagerness to traffic in versions of history that appeal to many white conservatives. He has publicly attacked Black officials who disagree with this warped worldview , and the crux of his political identity - touting so-called anti-wokeness - is staked in similar anti-Black revisionist history.\n\nDeSantis is using racial bigotry for his political benefit. This, my friends, is true race hustling.\n\nAldean is in a similar boat. As I w rote earlier this week , his video for \"Try That in a Small Town,\" which appears to promote racial violence, is essentially bigot bait. It's a poppy, formulaic insult to quality country music as it seeks to capitalize on white nationalist symbolism - and maybe a little bloodlust as well.\n\nAnd conservatives have been eating it up, to Aldean's delight. Singing a twangy tune at the site of an infamous lynching has carried the artist near the top of the Billboard charts . And Aldean's framing of the backlash to his video as an effort to cancel him - which has made many conservatives even more resolute in supporting him - seems to me like a blatant effort to cash in on their racial angst.\n\nAgain, more race hustling.\n\nAnd then there's Giuliani, who just this week admitted to lying about two Black election workers in Georgia - Ruby Freeman and her daughter Shaye Moss - whom he claimed tried to defraud Trump out of a 2020 election victory in the state. These lies were at the heart of Trump's 2020 election denialism, which Te a m Trump allegedly used to raise millions of dollars .\n\nPimpin' ain't easy, as the saying goes ... unless your base is Republican voters.\n\nThose familiar with Giuliani's history know he has a history of race hustling. Back in February, for example, I wrote about an MSNBC documentary, \" When Truth Isn't Truth: The Rudy Giuliani Story .\" Part of it tells the story of Giuliani's alliance with a mob that formed outside New York City Hall in 1992 to denounce Mayor David Dinkins, the city's first Black mayor.\n\nThat mob reportedly included several people who hurled racist epithets, as I note in both the blog post and this TikTok :\n\nGiuliani seemed all too willing to cash in on this racist vitriol en route to the mayorship himself. And he used Freeman and Moss in much the same way he used Dinkins: as Black targets he could subject to violent vitriol for personal gain.\n\nGiuliani d eployed racist tropes against the two election workers, including claims they had behaved like drug dealers \"passing out dope\" and even referring to Freeman, then 62, as a \"hustler.\"\n\nHow rich is that?\n\nRudy Giuliani, Jason Aldean and Ron DeSantis are the real hustlers. They push bigotry out to the masses, and then wait for the spoils to roll in.\n\nIs this a moral indictment of each of them as individuals? Absolutely. But the fact that their bigotry still holds valence in today's GOP is an indictment of Republican voters as well. They're the ones lapping up all of this.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

      "text": "In the American South, Moderate White Democrats Are Silenced\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoseph Crespino , a professor of history at Emory University, is the author of \"Strom Thurmond's America.\"\n\nUpdated October  2, 2012,  5:40 PM\n\nPart of the story of working-class whites in the Deep South lies in the demise of the moderate white Democrats who used to win their votes.  And that story is wrapped up very much in the history of voting rights and redistricting. Redistricting for black districts helped strengthen the conservative slant of white districts. The passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act did not usher in immediate political influence for black Southerners.  African-Americans and voting rights advocates had to work for years to overcome vote dilution schemes that preserved white political control.  By 1982, when Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act, Congressional districts were redrawn in ways that led to significant gains in black representation.  To do that, however, officials often had to pack those districts with high numbers of black voters, along with handfuls of liberal whites.  In the process, surrounding districts became increasingly \"white\" and conservative. Republicans were well aware of how these packed districts would ease their election, and they eagerly supported the process.  It made for an odd alliance between Southern blacks and white conservatives. The losers were white moderate Democrats. One of the myths of modern Southern politics is that Republicans came to power in the 1960s after the passage of the landmark civil rights legislation.  In fact, moderate white Democrats who combined middle-class economic issues with culturally conservative positions dominated Southern politics through the 1970s. They gave rise to two successful presidential candidates - Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. Southern Republicans had a terrible time trying to defeat moderate white Democrats who portrayed the G.O.P. as the country club party, one that was out of touch with the concerns of decent working people.

African-Americans and voting rights advocates had to work for years to overcome vote dilution schemes that preserved white political control.  By 1982, when Congress reauthorized the Voting Rights Act, Congressional districts were redrawn in ways that led to significant gains in black representation.  To do that, however, officials often had to pack those districts with high numbers of black voters, along with handfuls of liberal whites.  In the process, surrounding districts became increasingly \"white\" and conservative. Republicans were well aware of how these packed districts would ease their election, and they eagerly supported the process.  It made for an odd alliance between Southern blacks and white conservatives.\n\nThe losers were white moderate Democrats. One of the myths of modern Southern politics is that Republicans came to power in the 1960s after the passage of the landmark civil rights legislation.  In fact, moderate white Democrats who combined middle-class economic issues with culturally conservative positions dominated Southern politics through the 1970s. They gave rise to two successful presidential candidates - Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.\n\nSouthern Republicans had a terrible time trying to defeat moderate white Democrats who portrayed the G.O.P. as the country club party, one that was out of touch with the concerns of decent working people.

      "text": "Level of White Support for Obama a Surprise\n\nTrump Administration\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nThe Caucus\n\nBy John Harwood\n\nIf Tuesday's election were confined to white America, polls show, Senator Barack Obama would lose.\n\nAnd yet Mr. Obama's strength across racial lines lies at the heart of his lead in the polls over Senator John McCain heading into Election Day. Remarkably, Mr. Obama, the first black major party presidential nominee, trails among whites by less than Democratic nominees normally do.\n\nAmerica's political parties grew decisively polarized by race after 1964, the year President Lyndon Johnson signed civil rights legislation that his Republican presidential opponent, Barry Goldwater, opposed. Since then, election pollsters estimate, Democratic nominees have averaged 39 percent of the white vote. In last week's New York Times/CBS News poll, Mr. Obama drew 44 percent support among whites  a higher proportion than Bill Clinton captured in his general election victories.\n\nAnalysts ascribe that success to changing racial attitudes, Mr. Obama's deftness, Republican missteps and the economic crisis. Whatever the cause, when combined with his two-to-one edge among Hispanics and his 10-to-1 edge among blacks, it has given him a national election-eve lead.\n\nThe race is not over, and Election Day could bring surprises. And Mr. McCain is capturing a majority of the white vote, according to these same polls. Yet population shifts have made racial and ethnic diversity an unavoidable fact of American life. When Ronald Reagan won re-election in 1984, whites made up 86 percent of the electorate; by 2004, they had dropped to 77 percent.\n\nWith that backdrop, some observers say racial attitudes have diminished as an independent force, fading into the broader fabric of cultural concerns that shape voters' choices like religion, abortion and gun control.\n\n\"Anybody who votes against Barack Obama because of the color of his skin, the Republicans would have gotten on another cultural issue,\" said David Saunders, a consultant in Virginia who advises Democratic candidates on attracting white rural and working-class voters.\n\nThe presidential historian Michael Beschloss credits Mr. Obama with reprising the approach adopted by John F. Kennedy in his 1960 breakthrough as the first Roman Catholic to win the presidency. \"He was running to be president of all the people, not president of a faction,\" Mr. Beschloss said.\n\nA recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll documents Mr. Obama's success in making that case. Asked whether an Obama presidency would favor the interests of blacks over other Americans, 8 in 10 whites said it would not.\n\nFor Democratic strategists who have spent their careers laboring to regain white voters' allegiance, that alone is a striking achievement. In the mid-1980s, research by the pollster Stan Greenberg in Macomb County, Mich., concluded that middle-class whites resented the \"raw deal\" they received from a political debate in which Democrats appeared focused on racial minorities and the poor.\n\nLike Mr. Greenberg's client Bill Clinton in 1992, Mr. Obama has emphasized broad-gauged assistance for the middle class. \"He's managed to campaign in ways that may not have changed their world view but have allowed them to put those feelings aside,\" Mr. Greenberg said. He added with a note of bemusement, \"Maybe he has crossed over into Tiger Woods territory.\"\n\nFrustrated Republicans see Mr. Obama's steady performances on the stump and in debates as only part of the explanation for his surprising level of white support. Just as responsible, some argue, is that President Bush's unpopularity in threatening economic times has veered close to Herbert Hoover territory. \"You've got to give Obama an awful lot of credit for his likability,\" said Tom Slade, a former Florida Republican Party chairman, who abandoned his own Democratic allegiance in 1964 in the early phase of white conservatives' political migration. More important, he said, \"We have done a miserable job of managing the affairs of government.\"\n\nIn the early 1990s, the political reporter Peter Brown wrote \"Minority Party,\" a book exploring the pitfalls of the Democrats' identification with the interests of African-Americans. He credited Mr. Obama with providing \"a comfort zone\" for white voters, but pointed to the major boost he received this fall from the financial crisis on the watch of a Republican president.\n\n\"The most important color is green,\" said Mr. Brown, now assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. \"When Lehman Brothers went under, this thing changed dramatically. People are just terrified about their financial futures.\"\n\nIn the spring, some Democratic strategists feared Mr. Obama might be crippled in states where he lost working-class white primary voters decisively to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. In Ohio, carried by Mr. Bush in 2000 and 2004, polls now show Mr. Obama is competitive; in Pennsylvania, a top target for Mr. McCain, he is ahead in the polls.\n\nWith a message muting racial concerns, Mr. Obama didn't begin his presidential bid with overwhelming strength among blacks; that came only after he defeated Mrs. Clinton in the white-dominated Iowa caucuses. \"Ironically, the biggest difficulty about race for Obama was the doubts among African-Americans about his ability to succeed in the nominating process,\" said Tad Devine, a top strategist for Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004.\n\n\"It's amazing to me  almost unreal,\" Representative John Lewis of Georgia said. Earlier this fall Mr. Lewis, the civil rights movement veteran, accused Mr. McCain's campaign of \"sowing the seeds of hatred\" in a way that was reminiscent of George Wallace during the 1960s, an attack that the Republican nominee called \"brazen and baseless\" and that Mr. Obama distanced himself from.\n\nMore recently, Mr. Lewis added, the campaign has made him \"sort of sad\" since leaders of that movement, including the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and President Johnson, cannot witness Mr. Obama's candidacy.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Liberal Blind Spots Are Hiding the Truth About 'Trump Country'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nFor one thing, it's not Trump country. Most struggling whites I know here live a life of quiet desperation, mad at their white bosses, not resentful toward their co-workers or neighbors of color.\n\nBy Sarah Smarsh\n\nMs. Smarsh is the author of the forthcoming \"Heartland: A Memoir of Working Hard and Being Broke in the Richest Country on Earth.\"\n\nWICHITA, Kan. - Is the white working class an angry, backward monolith - some 90 million white Americans without college degrees , all standing around in factories and fields thumping their dirty hands with baseball bats? You might think so after two years of media fixation on this version of the aggrieved laborer: male, Caucasian, conservative, racist, sexist.\n\nThis account does white supremacy a great service in several ways: It ignores workers of color, along with humane, even progressive white workers. It allows college-educated white liberals to signal superior virtue while denying the sins of their own place and class. And it conceals well-informed, formally educated white conservatives - from middle-class suburbia to the highest ranks of influence - who voted for Donald Trump in legions.\n\nThe trouble begins with language: Elite pundits regularly misuse \"working class\" as shorthand for right-wing white guys wearing tool belts. My father, a white man and lifelong construction worker who labors alongside immigrants and people of color on job sites across the Midwest and South working for a Kansas-based general contractor owned by a woman, would never make such an error.\n\nMost struggling whites I know live lives of quiet desperation mad at their white bosses, not resentment of their co-workers or neighbors of color. My dad's previous three bosses were all white men he loathed for abuses of privilege and people.\n\nIt is unfair power that my father despises. The last rant I heard him on was not about race or immigration but about the recent royal wedding, the spectacle of which made him sick.\n\n\"What's so special about the royals?\" he told me over the phone from a cheap motel after work. \"But they'll get the best health care, the best education, the best food. Meanwhile I'm in Marion, Arkansas. All I want is some chickens and a garden and place to go fishing once in a while.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "White Democrats Lose More Ground in South\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Campbell Robertson\n\nIt was less than 50 years ago that a young man named Lewis McAllister Jr. won a special election to become a Mississippi state representative.\n\n\"We were, of course, pretty excited about that,\" said Wirt Yerger Jr., who at the time was the chairman of the state Republican Party. They had a right to be: Mr. McAllister was the first Republican of the 20th century to sit in the Mississippi Legislature. Being a Republican in the South, Mr. Yerger recalled, \"was pretty lonesome at first.\"\n\nThings are looking a little different now.\n\nA political realignment that has been taking place for decades hit overdrive in last week's elections, leaving Republicans at a stronger position in the South than at any time since Reconstruction. And with Republican control of so many legislatures on the eve of redistricting, white Democrats, who once occupied every available political office in the region, are facing near extinction in some states.\n\n\"The Democratic Party as we know it in Alabama is dead,\" boasted Philip Bryan, the spokesman for the state's Republican Party, which gained control of the legislature for the first time in more than a century. \"We just killed it.\"\n\nThe degree of one-party control Republicans have just achieved in much of the South has broad implications for future campaign strategies. But it also provides a laboratory to study the internal debates of the Republican Party, the effects of undiluted conservative policy and a nearly one-to-one relationship between party preference and race, at least in national contests in the Deep South.\n\nOf the nine Democratic representatives that remain from the states of the Deep South, only one, John Barrow of Georgia, is white. Of the 28 Republicans, only one, the newly elected Tim Scott of South Carolina, is black.\n\nRepublicans now hold at least 93 of the 131 House seats from the states of the old Confederacy. Less than 20 years ago they did not even hold half. With the defeat of long-serving fiscally conservative Blue Dogs like Representatives Gene Taylor of Mississippi and John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, Southern white Democrats in Congress have become as rare as a Dixie blizzard.\n\nRepublicans, however, say their job is not finished. The South is often thought of as red to its core, but it is not as simple as that. The preference for Republicans has trickled down over the decades, with voters first supporting Republican presidential candidates, then Republican congressmen  who often simply switched parties  and more recently Republican state legislators.\n\nState Republican Party officials say they are now looking at local officials like sheriffs and chancery clerks who still often run as Democrats.\n\n\"That's the last bastion,\" said Brad White, the chairman of the Mississippi Republican Party.\n\nThe enduring allegiance to the Democratic Party among Southern whites comes from a fondness for incumbents, an enduring populist streak, lingering gratitude for the New Deal in certain areas and, in large part, habit.\n\nWhile white Southern voters may be dropping that habit, this does not necessarily mean they are all eager to embrace the Republicans.\n\nMerle Black, a political science professor at Emory University and a co-author of \"The Rise of Southern Republicans,\" said that white conservatives first fled the Democratic Party in large numbers in the 1960s, turned off by the civil rights legislation and social programs of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society. But it was not until the Reagan years that they felt comfortable identifying as Republicans.\n\nA similar pattern is unfolding now with white Southern moderates, Mr. Black said, who are repelled by President Obama's policies but have not fully embraced the other side.\n\nGeorge Dale, a Democrat who was Mississippi's insurance commissioner from 1975 to 2007, is one of those moderates.\n\n\"People like me almost find themselves without a party,\" he said.\n\nThe causes of the Southern disillusionment with the Democrats are complicated. Race plays a role, which shows up in the muttering of an Arkansas farmer who said he did not trust blacks in power, or in the bumper sticker in Louisiana that read \"Don't blame me, I voted for the American.\" But it is not the only factor.\n\n\"Some of it is cyclical, some of it's racial, some of it's fueled by cable TV,\" Mr. Dale said.\n\nMany of the white Southerners losing faith in the Democrats are more moderate on social issues and less hostile to social programs than Republicans, but they dislike the Obama administration so much that they are taking it out on any Democrat in sight.\n\nMr. Dale said many Southern voters saw the national Democrats as pursuing polices of an overreaching government.\n\n\"If the Democratic Party has any intentions of being a factor on the state level, they're going to have to find a way to move back to the middle,\" he said.\n\nUntil then, the task of governance is starting to fall almost exclusively to the Republican Party. That may be more difficult than it seems.\n\nTraditional Southern Republicanism is socially conservative and assertively pro-business, characterized by an aversion to taxes, regulation, abortion, same-sex marriage and gun control.\n\nBut while its politicians have long held forth against the federal government, the South remains heavily dependent on federal largesse in the form of farm subsidies, defense contracts and aid for its large concentrations of poor people. More than a few Southern Republicans who railed against the federal stimulus package accepted the money anyway.\n\nThe Tea Party brand of conservatism is less tolerant of this wink-and-nod approach to government spending and places a lower priority on social issues.\n\nIt has some echoes of the small-government gospel that was preached by Mr. Yerger and other pioneers of the modern Republican Party in the South, who found few Southerners sympathetic to their condemnation of the New Deal. Many of them initially viewed social issues like segregation as tactical stands worth taking to draw disaffected Democrats to their free-market agenda, according to Joseph Crespino, a professor at Emory who has studied the rise of conservative politics in Mississippi.\n\nHow the small-government fundamentalists of the Tea Party fit into the mainstream Southern Republican Party remains to be seen.\n\n\"This could be a very fleeting experience for the Republican Party, if they ignore us,\" said Kevin Desmond, a director of the Patriots of East Tennessee, a local Tea Party group. \"When Lamar Alexander, the senator here in Tennessee, comes up for election in 2014, I think he's going to have his hands full.\"\n\nThere are other signs that the realignment might not be permanent. Growing Latino populations in Florida and Texas, and in Georgia and South Carolina, could rearrange the political map again before too long.\n\nAnd then there is the curious case of North Carolina. While Republicans racked up historic victories in state races on Tuesday, seven of the state's eight Democratic congressmen survived challenges, including Heath Shuler, a young Blue Dog elected in 2006.\n\nThat, oddly enough, leaves North Carolina with one of the most Democratic Congressional delegations outside of the Northeast.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "What's Nikki Haley's Endgame?\n\nListen to What Next:\n\nWhen Ed Kilgore found out that Nikki Haley was planning to run for president, he wasn't exactly surprised. Kilgore is a political columnist for New York magazine, and he's been keeping tabs on Haley's career for a while. \"Anybody who's followed her career knows that she's shown every indication of the affliction by which politicians look in the mirror and see a future president of the United States,\" he said.\n\nHaley's only the second person to declare her intent to run in 2024. The other one, of course, is Donald Trump. Haley achieved a national profile when she served as Trump's ambassador to the United Nations. Now, she's the first one to challenge him for the Republican nomination. To announce her candidacy, Haley released a video making her first presidential pitch to the country. Kilgore wasn't too impressed.\n\n\"It's sort of the nonwhite person who offers moral authority in absolving white conservatives of any implications of racism. There's nothing that white conservatives love more than being reassured that they're not racist by nonwhite voices,\" he said. \"And that's what Haley is taking advantage of.\"\n\nAccording to Kilgore, Haley's biggest problem is that she can't seem to articulate why she should be the next commander in chief. She's got no catchy slogan, no major endorsement, no particularly remarkable achievements to point to. \"She's actually a pretty well-known national Republican figure. Yet she's mired in the low single digits in every poll that shows her going up against Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis. So I'm not very impressed at how she seems to be proceeding at this point.\"\n\nOn Wednesday's episode of What Next , I spoke with Kilgore about how Nikki Haley wants to take on Donald Trump-and how even though it's February 2023, she might already be falling behind. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nMary C. Curtis: Can you introduce our listeners to the Nikki Haley story, starting with her early life in South Carolina?\n\nEd Kilgore: She grew up in South Carolina, the child of Indian immigrants who were actually Sikhs. She followed the Sikh religion until well into her adulthood, when she converted to Methodism. And as a fairly young woman, she had a couple of business ventures. She was elected to the state Legislature from a Columbia suburb and very quickly identified herself with the hard-core right-wing portion of the South Carolina party, but one that thought of itself as modern and free of the kind of racism that it afflicted there for a long time.\n\nSo she was sort of a reform conservative figure in South Carolina. In 2010 when she ran for governor as very much a long shot, she either was afflicted by or got lucky because of-depending on how you look at it-two different men who made apparently baseless accusations of sexual infidelity on her part, that they had had flings with her. They never supplied any concrete evidence. And that naturally made Nikki Haley a sympathetic figure to a lot of voters who had never heard of her. That also made her a great object of affection from Sarah Palin, who dubbed her a \"mama grizzly\" and came in to South Carolina and campaigned, probably at the peak of Palin's popularity. And so at a pretty young age, she got the launch she needed and became governor of this very Republican state.\n\nI remember that race, and members of her own party did subject her to quite a bit of racist abuse as well. What kind of platform did she run on and what were her political priorities? Did she make them clear?\n\nHer message-and again, this nicely meshed with the alleged scandals and efforts to smear her as a woman-was that she was running against the good ol' boys of the South Carolina Republican establishment. And in South Carolina, that doesn't just mean old men. It also means people that really were old Dixiecrats that migrated out of the Democratic Party to the Republican Party for convenience and brought a lot of their racist baggage along with them. Like a lot of other Southern states, there was a modern Republican movement-they called themselves at the time \"reform conservatives\"-who wanted really hard-core right-wing fiscal and economic policies but without the racism. And she was a perfect profile for that, not just because of her message, but because of her identity. And sure enough, she did beat the good ol' boys.\n\nIt's interesting that the thing probably many national folks know her for was that stand taking down the Confederate flag from the Statehouse grounds after the massacre in 2015. We all remember in Mother Emanuel, where nine African Americans were shot and killed, including a legislator - Clementa Pinckney - and a reverend. What do you make of that and what folks perceived and what the reality was?\n\nShe hit all the right notes at the time. There's no way I could criticize her reaction, her pretty much heartfelt sympathy for what happened, her efforts to unite Black and white South Carolinians in mourning, what happened in Charleston.\n\nBut she got adulatory national press for that gesture. And I might add, it was a good 20 years after a previous Republican governor of South Carolina tried to do the same thing and really got into political trouble for it. I would argue that by the time Nikki Haley took down the flag, it was pretty much noncontroversial, which showed some excellent timing on her part. But I think she got a little bit too much credit for being something that she's not, which is some sort of progressive or even moderate.\n\nI find it very interesting that she does not mention that in her announcement video. There are images of the days after the massacre, but no reference to her taking down the Confederate flag from the Statehouse. She has subsequently, by the way, said that Dylann Roof, the murderer in Charleston, hijacked the Confederate flag, which was basically suggesting that it was a perfectly acceptable, noble symbol before he hijacked it in his murderous rage. So I'm not quite sure if she's soft-pedaling that to placate neo-Confederates in the Republican Party or what.\n\nShe also made a pretty big show of not supporting Trump in 2016 because of his rhetoric. And she tied the rhetoric to the violence like Charleston. But in 2017, she flip-flopped and joined his administration as United States ambassador to the U.N. So why the change of heart and what was her tenure there like?\n\nShe's hardly alone among Republicans in moving all over the place in her relationship with Donald J. Trump. Her senior U.S. senator, Lindsey Graham, is dancing like Arthur Murray, going back and forth on Trump for years. So I don't know that she's distinguished herself in duplicity on the question of trial, but she has moved around an awful lot . She said harsh, harsh things about him in 2016, but then supported his general election campaign. She accepted a position in this administration but seemed to be whispering to media that she wasn't really his person.\n\nShe was appointed U.N. ambassador, checked that all-important foreign policy box, and-this really did impress me at the time-managed to vaguely convey the sense that she was independent of Donald Trump in terms of what she said and did at the U.N. without ever really criticizing him, either. So she developed this reputation as an independent figure who wasn't opposed to Donald Trump but certainly wasn't his creature.\n\nAll that changed on Jan. 6 ... sort of. At the RNC the day after the insurrection, Haley told her fellow Republicans that Trump's \"actions since Election Day will be judged harshly by history.\" That level of conviction didn't last long, though.\n\nAfter Jan. 6, she said some very negative things about Trump, said he had disqualified himself, frankly, from further national leadership. Then, not too long after that, she backtracked and said, in fact, if he ran for president in 2024, she would support him. Obviously that's not happening. Her constituency in the Republican Party, if she's going to succeed in a presidential campaign, is going to be among people who are tired of Trump, whether they liked him or not or supported him or not in the past.\n\nMuch of Haley's career is built on her ability to play both sides-on the issues, on Trump, on pretty much everything. But that won't be as easy in a presidential campaign.\n\nIf she's serious about running for president, she's going to be spending a lot of time at Pizza Ranches in Iowa very soon, where regular Republican voters are going to ask her a lot of questions about who she is, what she's done, what she wants to do. And it's pretty serious scrutiny. To the extent that maybe she has benefited from some ambivalence about what she stands for, and from-frankly-unearned positive media attention, that could wear off pretty quickly in a presidential campaign.\n\nDo you think her announcement is amounting to maybe hopes that folks are finally casting Trump aside, both voters and the party?\n\nI think that's the calculation. The problem is that's also the calculation of Ron DeSantis, Tim Scott, Mike Pompeo; Lord knows who is going to wind up in this race. And all of them not named Donald Trump are going to be calculating that Republicans are tired of Donald Trump. Why Nikki Haley, though, as opposed to some of these other candidates-particularly DeSantis, who started way, way, way ahead of her early in the going?\n\nShe is from an early state, South Carolina, which votes third in the Republican presidential nominating contest. Donald Trump had an event there recently where he locked up really about half the well-known politicians in the state, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, the current governor, the current lieutenant governor, the state treasurer, three members of the U.S. House. So, she's got some catching up to do in her home state. And then, Ron DeSantis will clearly be strong there, just like he is everywhere else at the moment. If she loses her home state, her presidential campaign is done.\n\nI want to talk a little bit about her relationship with Trump. He usually goes harshly after someone who has criticized him so much in such stark condemnation as she did when it came to Jan. 6. But he really hasn't come out yet. Does he see her as real competition?\n\nFrankly, Trump's public attitude toward her can only be described as condescending. It's going to be interesting how he talks about Haley. But his general posture right now is that he doesn't take her seriously enough to go after her the way he normally does his political rivals. And who knows? In any given moment, Donald Trump can erupt, and he may give her a nasty nickname or go after her personally. Who knows? The problem for Nikki Haley is that's not within her control. So if she's going to define her relationship with Donald Trump in a way that improves her prospects, she's got to get on it right now and not just wait around to see what he's going to do.\n\nGet more news from Mary Harris every weekday.\n\nThe open question is exactly what shape Haley's ambitions will take if being president isn't on the table. Some commentators have already begun positioning her as a possible vice presidential candidate on Trump's ticket.\n\nLet's just say, for the sake of argument, she does want to be vice president and Trump wins the nomination and she's on his list. (There have been reports already that Trump is maybe exclusively considering women as a running mate for all kinds of obvious reasons.) I do think that if she winds up in that position, she's not going to have the independence from Trump that she implied that she had as a member of his administration. The perpetual role model for a Trump vice president is Mike Pence prior to Jan. 6, the craven toadying to the president, with his big shoulders , as Mike Pence said about a thousand times. The bigger question about the vice presidency is whether Haley really wants to do that. And, of course, there's also the very strong possibility that the nominee is not going to be Donald Trump. It's going to be Ron DeSantis.\n\nShe's 51 years old, which is pretty young in terms of contemporary presidential expectations. She's basically a quarter-century younger than Donald Trump. She doesn't have to run for president right now, which is part of the reason I wonder why she's doing it right now. But nobody really knows what the post-Trump Republican Party is going to look like. It's probably going to be a little Trumpier than she's shown herself to be so far. And there's competition. So maybe she is the future of the Republican Party, but it may be a really distant future at this point.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "White Supremacy Rules Everything Around Me\n\nIf you were watching MSNBC on Dec. 29, and you stayed through the close of Melissa Harris-Perry's eponymous show, you saw 90 seconds of odd, tasteless commentary about the hilarity of the Romney family photo. In it, Mitt Romney held his adopted grandson Kieran-adopted a couple of months ago by Ben, the blond Romney brother-on his knee. The video has not aged well.\n\nIts timing was suboptimal for Harris-Perry and for MSNBC (which pays me as a contributor, full disclosure). The year's slowest news week had begun. Th e Duck Dynast y affair had spun itself out, leaving conservatives ready for some scalpin' of their own. It was probably inevitable that MHP be pilloried for a week, and give several apologies, culminating with a tearful mea culpa at the top of her Jan. 4 show. And it was inevitable that Sarah Palin would weigh in with words bearing a superficial resemblance to English. \"Holy unbelievable,\" she wrote . \"The LSM's pursuit of 'shock ratings' is unreal.\"\n\nThere's nothing in the clip to indicate a \"ratings\" stunt; MSNBC's weekend ratings are about one-thirty-fifth the size of a good Duck Dynasty night. Yes, Palin appears to have written an entire book about First Amendment freedoms without approaching the topic with any sort of consistency. Hilarious! But let's move on, because Mitt Romney said so.\n\nI was on one of my short book leaves* during most of the Duck Dynasty controversy, so it's not that story that brings me to MHP as much as Ta-Nehisi Coates' Slatepitchy defense of what was actually happening on set that day.\n\nThere is a sense that Romney's grandchild should be off-limits to mockery. That strikes me as fair.\n\nYeah, it's fair. Not a hard call.\n\nIt also doesn't strike me that mocking was what Harris-Perry was doing. The problem was making any kind of light of a fraught subject-a black child being reared by a family whose essential beliefs were directly shaped by white supremacy, whose patriarch sought to lead a movement which derives most its energy from white supremacy. That's a weighty subtext.\n\nWas that what it was? MHP's joke, that the Romney kid should grow up to marry Kanye West and Kim Kardashian's son, was fairly harmless. The DNA of the joke seemed to be: Mitt Romney's family is really dorky, and the West-Kardashians are not . The other jokes were making light of how a black kid in the midst of a white family reunion was sort of a statement on how white the GOP was. Coates explains where this agita came from:\n\nRomney's familiarity with white supremacy was not passive and distant but direct and tangible. As a child he lived in a neighborhood which, by the employment of compacts, red-lining, and terrorism, was an exclusive white preserve . As an adult, Romney worships in a church that as late as 1978 took racism not simply as policy but as the word of God.\n\nThat's all true, and yet in 2013 Romney's son Ben adopted a kid from Ethiopia . Ben Romney was born in 1978, the year that, in the words of Trey Parker and Matt Stone, \"God changed his mind about black people.\" What's the half-life on how long Ben Romney should have to apologize for white supremacy? Ten more years? Twenty? Until there's something like statistical parity in black/white employment and salary levels?\n\nIf Coates is right, and the MHP panelists were making light of \"white supremacy\" when it mocked the family photo, does that mean they were automatically just in doing so? That feels like the implication here. Republicans generally believe in policies (and endorse cultural signifiers) that cut back on economic redistribution to nonwhites, so everything they say or do can be disqualified on those grounds. That feels awfully nihilistic.\n\nSo, sure. Sometimes, there's going to be tokenism in defense of illiberal or discriminatory policy-ask the black activists who were paid to lobby against South African sanctions in the 1980s. (Really, they existed!) Sometimes, there's going to be an honest disagreement about a policy shift that looks harmful to nonwhites but doesn't come from that place-ask some of the school choice campaigners.\n\nObviously, MHP quickly realized that making fun of the way a white Republican family looked as it celebrated a new, nonwhite arrival wasn't the best way to approach any of this. She apologized. She had to. Telling white conservatives that everything they do is rooted in privilege is telling them to put on blinders whenever any policy they want to try is dubbed \"racist.\" There's a reason we've come to appreciate the political skill of John Lewis and totally forgotten about Kwame Ture.\n\n*I'm approaching the whole process as a series of sprints, one to three weeks at a time off the clock.

      "text": "Color Blind\n\nPhoto by Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nIf I were outlining a racial history of the Obama administration, it would begin with policy: A housing collapse that destroyed black Americans' wealth; a health care law attacked as \"reparations\" and crippled by a neo-Calhounite doctrine of \"state sovereignty\"; a broad assault on voting rights and access to the polls, concentrated in the states of the former Confederacy. Indeed, it would focus on the deep irony of the Obama era: That the first black president has presided over a declining status quo for many black Americans.\n\nIn short, it would treat race as a real force in public life that has real consequences for real people.\n\nYou should contrast this with Jonathan Chait's most recent feature for New York magazine, where the story of race in the Obama administration is a story of mutual grievance between Americans on the left and right, with little interest in the lived experiences of racism from black Americans and other people of color. It's a story, in other words, that treats race as an intellectual exercise-a low-stakes cocktail party argument between white liberals and white conservatives over their respective racial innocence.\n\n\"If you ... set out to write a social history of the Obama years, one that captured the day-to-day experience of political life,\" Chait writes, \"you would find that race has saturated everything as perhaps never before. Hardly a day goes by without a volley and counter-volley of accusations of racial insensitivity and racial hypersensitivity.\"\n\nThat might fit the experiences of a mostly white pundit class, but it has nothing to do with race as experienced in the \"day-to-day\" lives of ordinary people. When a twentysomething black New Yorker talks about race, she isn't as concerned with the rhetoric of Republicans as she is with the patrol car that trails her teenage brother when he rides his bike to the corner store.\n\nIn any case, Chait marshals an impressive amount of evidence to make two points: First, that \"racial conservatism\" and ideological conservatism have become one and the same , and that this is true for \"racial liberalism\" and ideological liberalism as well. What's more, Chait argues that the worst suspicions of both sides are true: Conservatives have leveraged racial resentment in service of other political goals, and liberals have wielded the word racist as a weapon against their foes, regardless of the offense.\n\nWhat's odd about the argument is that Chait clearly shows the extent to which conservatism-even if it isn't \"racist\"-works to entrench racial inequality through \"colorblindness\" and pointed opposition to the activist state. But rather than take that to its conclusion, he asks us to look away: \"Impressive though the historical, sociological, and psychological evidence undergirding this analysis may be, it also happens to be completely insane. Whatever Lee Atwater said, or meant to say, advocating tax cuts is not in any meaningful sense racist.\"\n\nOf course, it's not accusing conservatives of \"racism\" to note that particular policies-say, tax cuts to defund the social safety net, or blocking the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act-have a disparate impact . That's just reality. And it's not tarring your opponents to note that race plays a huge part in building popular support for those policies. But again, for as much as this is interesting as a matter of political combat, it's less important to telling the story of race in the Obama years than, for instance, the tremendous retrenchment of racial inequality during our five years of recession, recovery, and austerity.\n\nChait finishes his piece with a note (a hope?) that this dynamic of grievance will become irrelevant with time: \"The passing from the scene of the nation's first black president in three years, and the near-certain election of its 45 th nonblack one, will likely ease the mutual suspicion. In the long run, generational changes grind inexorably away.\"\n\nYes, the Return of the White President will cause this tension to recede, as arguments over racial innocence-\"You're racist!\" \"You're a race baiter!\"-fade like the elves of Middle-Earth . But that's only the end of the story if you're most concerned with partisan fights.\n\nIf it's policy that dominates your racial history of the Obama era, the future is uncertain and filled with questions. By gutting a key provision of the Affordable Care Act, Chief Justice John Roberts has left a gaping hole in Medicaid coverage, cutting millions of blacks and Latinos out of the benefits of the law. Will we fix this, and if we don't, what does that mean for the fight against racial inequality in our economy? Will we do anything to rebuild black wealth and end the long-term unemployment crisis in black communities? Will we end the drug war and move against mass incarceration? Will we buck the Supreme Court and push back against the conservative campaign to dismantle the Voting Rights Act? Will we leave millions of Latino immigrants on the margins of society because a white conservative minority refuses to sign on to immigration reform? And so on, and so on.\n\nYou could argue that answering these questions-and finding solutions-requires a focus on the nature of racial conversation during and after the Obama era, in which case, Chait's focus is well-placed. If racial conservatism is indistinguishable from its ideological counterpart-if attitudes toward blacks are determinative of attitudes toward government, and vice versa-then that poses a tremendous challenge to ameliorating racial inequality and injustice, both by way of government (a strong social safety net) and its restraint (criminal justice reform).\n\nStill, if you're trying to tell the story of race in the Obama years, Chait's version strikes me as utterly ancillary. First and foremost in this history has to be the ways in which race kept its material salience despite the momentous political event of a black president. The partisan reactions to Trayvon Martin and Jordan Davis are less important than the activism that emerged around them, in the same way that Republican complaints of language policing are less important than the party's ongoing push for voter suppression.\n\nRace matters for reasons far beyond the fact that it is another battleground for partisan combat.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "How to Save the Voting Rights Act\n\nPhoto by Sara D. Davis/Getty Images\n\nIn 2010, the Simpsons featured a news helicopter emblazoned with the logo: \"FOX News: Not Racist, But #1 with Racists.\" That slogan might be applied to today's Republican Party, which in recent years has actively passed voting laws that make it harder for poor and minority voters to vote. Whether to label the Republican Party \"racist\" isn't an academic exercise. The question is actually at the heart of lawsuits over the future of voting rights in Texas and North Carolina. It's also a question with historical resonance, particularly on the eve of the Voting Rights Act's 50 th anniversary this week.\n\nThe five-decade history of the Voting Rights Act is told masterfully in Ari Berman's new book, Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America . Berman starts around the time of the Selma, Alabama, marches, but unlike the movie Selma , Berman goes on to give us the rest of the history: the expansion of voting rights protections in 1970 and 1975 to include Latinos, Native Americans, and others over the objections of racists, many in the Democratic Party; the important 1982 rewriting of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, providing additional protections for minority voters nationally, and (now Chief Justice) John Roberts' key role for the Reagan administration in unsuccessfully fighting against the expansion; hot disputes over voting rights in Florida in the 2000 election; the controversial renewal of the expiring \"preclearance provisions\" of the act in 2006 that continued to require states with a history of discrimination to get federal approval before changing their voting laws; and the ongoing \" voting wars \" that accelerated when Roberts led the court's conservatives in striking down the 2006 preclearance renewal in Shelby County v. Holder .\n\nBerman's book, like Jim Rutenberg's excellent cover story for the New York Times Magazine on the 50 th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, views the struggles over voting rules primarily through the lens of race. And although that is an essential lens to apply, it downplays the growing role of partisan politics in this story, a partisan struggle that is having profound ramifications for the newest wave of court cases involving voting restrictions. Put simply, the Republican Party has reasons unrelated to racial animus to push new voting restrictions.\n\nWhen Congress passed the Voting Rights Act in 1965, the Democratic Party was dominant in the South, and the Republican Party still had many liberals in its ranks. In part thanks to the Voting Rights Act, which was tremendously successful in fostering the registration and turnout of blacks in the South, the political parties began to realign. Today, the Republican Party is the party of conservatives, and in the South that means primarily white conservatives, and the Democratic Party is the party of liberals, and in the South that means primarily blacks.\n\nMany of the ideological leaders of the Republican Party, especially outside the South as it emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, were conservatives but not racist. Think of Roberts, who adheres to a \"colorblind\" vision of the Constitution and who seems to believe that racism isn't a major problem in American society anymore. While acknowledging that racism still exists, he wrote in his Shelby County opinion that \"things have changed in the South.\"\n\nBut while most Republican leaders are not themselves racist, they have long promoted policies that build on white racism, resentment, and fears of losing dominance in American society. From opposition to busing and affirmative action in the 1970s and 1980s to calls to \"take our country back\" in more recent years, the Republican Party is certainly the No. 1 party of racists, even if it is not racist itself.\n\nAnd this brings us to Republican electoral strategies, especially in the South. This past term the Supreme Court decided a redistricting case out of Alabama in which the state's Republican legislature shoved black voters into fewer districts. The court sent the case back to the district court to determine if race was the predominant factor in creating these districts, which would make the districts unconstitutional.\n\nOne view of the redistricting is that the Alabama legislature was motivated by race. Another is that the redistricting was about securing Republican Party advantage: Put blacks-the state's reliable Democratic voters-into fewer districts and you end up with more Republican districts. But the plaintiffs alleged that Alabama legislators were up to something a bit more subtle : Make sure all the Democratic districts have black representatives so that white racist voters would think of the Democratic Party as the \"black party.\"\n\nThinking about whether the Republican Party is motivated by race or party matters not only for these \"racial gerrymandering\" claims. It is also key to the Voting Rights Act disputes currently in the courts.\n\nSince 2000, we have seen a wave of Republican legislatures passing rules to make it harder to register and vote. One of the lessons of 2000, as both Berman and I have recounted, is that changes to voting rules matter in close elections. So far, attacks that new Republican voting restrictions violate the Constitution because states should not burden voters without good reason have mostly failed . So civil rights activists and Democrats have attacked the laws as Voting Rights Act violations.\n\nIn the case of Texas' strict voter identification law-which made concealed weapons permits sufficient identification for voting but not student ID cards- a federal district court found that Texas enacted its law with a racially discriminatory intent. Texas has defended itself by saying it had good policy grounds for enacting its laws, but at most its laws were partisan, not racist. The case is currently on appeal. In the North Carolina voting trial over a restrictive set of laws that the state enacted just after the Supreme Court eliminated its preclearance requirement in the Shelby County case, the Justice Department and voting rights activists are trying to prove the law violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. It is a tough claim to bring given the standards of Section 2. The best way for the plaintiffs to win the case is if they can prove that North Carolina had a racially discriminatory intent, but there's usually no smoking gun to support such claims.\n\nWhy can't those suing just point to the North Carolina legislature's bad partisan intent? After all, most observers recognize that the state's claim that its law is necessary to prevent voter fraud and instill voter confidence is bogus and that this is all about gaining partisan advantage in the next election. The problem is that the Supreme Court hasn't recognized partisan intent as reason enough to strike down voting restrictions. It upheld Indiana's law in 2008 even though it appeared it was passed for partisan reasons.\n\nSo we are left with the impossible situation of trying to untangle racial and partisan motives and effects. Especially in the South, with its conflicting racial and party overlap, this is a losing exercise. Nevertheless, civil rights lawyers' best bet is to attack these laws under the Voting Rights Act and to put the emphasis on race. So in both Texas and North Carolina, the claim is that the Republican legislatures acted as racists. It isn't clear if the Supreme Court will go along, even if the lower courts continue to make such findings, or if the court will read Section 2 broadly enough to make new voting restrictions illegal absent racial intent.\n\nAs we think about what we need best to protect voting rights going forward, the time has come to add protections for all voters. Today, Republicans see the Voting Rights Act as protection for Democrats, not racial minorities. Although Republicans overwhelmingly supported the 2006 renewal of the Voting Rights Act, Senate Judiciary Committee members issued a report that all but declared the law unconstitutional. The Republican Party will not bite on increased protections for racial minorities; efforts to come up with a new preclearance formula after Shelby County have received very little Republican support .\n\nA strengthened Voting Rights Act should start with this proposition: When the state has no good reason for making it harder for people to register and vote, doing so should be illegal. If we can get Congress to acknowledge this fundamental point, we won't have to worry about parsing racial or partisan intent, and voters throughout the country will be protected. Voting rights will be protected without having to prove Republican racism. We will protect not just minority voters but student voters, military and overseas voters, poor voters, and voters who move around a lot and lose their registrations. I'm not holding my breath that this will happen anytime soon, but a colorblind amendment to the act seems like the only path through a Republican Congress to adding voting rights protections for the next 50 years of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "What We Didn't Overcome\n\nElecting Barack Obama president was a glorious Jackie Robinson moment for the United States of America. Obama didn't just win; he became the first Democrat since Jimmy Carter to win a popular-vote majority. He won a larger proportion of white votes than any previous nonincumbent Democratic presidential candidate since Carter. Ta-Nehisi Coates, writing in the Washington Post 's Outlook section, was moved to conclude that Obama's victory vindicated Martin Luther King's \"belief in white people,\" a belief Coates once scoffed at as a sign of \"weakness and cowardice, a lack of faith in his own.\"\n\nAs a white person, I accept with gratitude Coates' warm feelings. But I fear they may be a tad premature. While it's certainly true that enough white people voted for Obama to put him in the Oval Office, the blunt fact remains that a majority of white people did not. Although Obama beat John McCain in the popular vote by an impressive seven-point margin, McCain beat Obama among white voters by an even more impressive 12-point margin. Obama got 53 percent of the broad electorate to vote for him but only 43 percent of the white electorate. When I say \"white electorate,\" I don't mean the white working class, or white Southerners, or any other subgroup whose capacity for racial tolerance has long been held suspect. I mean all white voters.\n\nThat strikes me as a hidden-in-plain-sight phenomenon that warrants greater attention. Yet surprisingly little coverage has bothered to note Obama's white-vote deficit. A rare exception was a Nov. 2 New York Times article by John Harwood (\" Level of White Support for Obama a Surprise \"), which quite appropriately predicted that Obama would fail to win a majority of white votes before moving on to the more hopeful news that Obama had made greater inroads among whites than most recent Democratic predecessors. The sad reality is that no Democratic candidate for president since Lyndon Johnson has won a majority of white votes (and even he lost 1964's white Southern vote to Barry Goldwater).\n\nAm I saying that any white vote against Obama must be counted as racist? Of course not. White people have all sorts of reasons for deciding who they vote for, and most (though not all) white conservatives would have a hard time justifying a vote for any Democratic presidential candidate. Nor am I saying that all or even most Republican voters harbor racial prejudice against African-Americans. Although a majority of whites was never going to vote for a black Democrat in 2008, it's entirely possible that a majority of whites might have voted for a black Republican. (Remember the brief GOP frenzy to draft Colin Powell to run against Bill Clinton in 1996?) More whites voted for Obama than for the very white John Kerry or Al Gore. That doesn't sound like racist behavior. It's Democrats who most whites dislike, not black people.\n\nBut in a more complex and indirect way, the stubborn refusal of a majority of whites to vote Democratic is all about race. Take a look at this chart . The alignment of whites with the Republican Party hasn't made it impossible for Democrats to win presidential elections, but it has made it fairly difficult. For the past 40 years, whites have made up 74 percent to somewhere north of 90 percent of all voters. Jimmy Carter got elected president by narrowing to four percentage points the gap between whites voting Republican and whites voting Democratic. Bill Clinton did it by narrowing the gap to a remarkable 2 percent. I don't think it's a coincidence that both men drew some appeal simply from being white Southerners. The South is where the GOP holds its tightest grip on the white vote.\n\nIt's no puzzler why Johnson was the last Democrat to win a majority of the white vote. He signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act into law, observing as he signed the former that \"we have lost the South for a generation.\" (Actually, it's been two generations, and nobody would be surprised to see three.) What Johnson didn't allow himself to think was, \"We have lost the white vote for a generation.\" (Again, it's been more like two.) Were LBJ transported to the year 2008, he would be deeply moved to discover that the United States had elected a black man president. But he would find it very depressing to learn that none of his Democratic successors ever won a white majority. Surely, he'd think, it's harder for Democrats to elect a black man president than to win forgiveness from the white majority for abolishing Jim Crow.\n\nThe good news is that my fellow Caucasians are aging out of their lock-step Republicanism. Obama failed to win a majority of whites (43 percent); or white men (41 percent); or even white women (46 percent), who are more open to voting Democratic. But he won 54 percent of all white voters age 18 to 29, to McCain's 44 percent. You'll note from the chart that the white majority among voters has been shrinking during the past 40 years, just as the white majority has shrunk in the general population. The three-point drop since 2004, though, is so dramatic that a likely explanation isn't demographics at all but rather a greater disinclination than usual among white folks this year to vote. Turnout in 2008 was about what it was in 2004, and, according to the Center for the Study of the American Electorate , the reason it wasn't higher-as widely expected, given the keen interest in this election-was that fewer Republicans went to the polls. The percentage of Democrats who went to the polls increased 2.6 percentage points while the percentage of Republicans went down 1.3 percentage points. The greatest favor the white race did Obama this year may have been to stay home. That's a far cry from Martin Luther King's dream, but it's a start.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Four Steps for Getting Republicans on Board With Criminal Justice Reform\n\nThe First Step Act of 2018 is a small step toward ending mass incarceration. This bipartisan legislation reduced certain mandatory-minimum sentences, prevents federal prison guards from shackling pregnant detainees, and will help federal prisoners earn early release. These reforms are long-overdue, but they will not dent America's staggering incarceration rate. This is because less than 10 percent of the U.S. incarcerated population is in federal prisons.\n\nMore ambitious change must occur on the state and local levels. To pursue this goal, Democrats must continue to work with Republicans, who control 27 governor's mansions and 30 state legislatures . Although bipartisan proposals are not always good proposals, consensus does not necessarily mean compromise. Many conservatives agree with progressives on important policies despite philosophical differences. Since the 2000s, red states such as Texas have begun to reduce incarceration, enhance in-prison rehabilitation programs, expand aid to former prisoners re-entering society, and even close prisons. The First Step Act-which received 87 votes in the GOP-controlled Senate-should provide Republican governors and state legislators with political cover to build on past success.\n\nInterviews with experts from across the ideological spectrum about criminal justice reform strategy revealed four action steps to advance progressive initiatives in conservative states.\n\n1. Encourage white conservatives who have been harmed by mass incarceration to tell their stories.\n\nMost influential works about mass incarceration, such as Locking Up Our Own and The New Jim Crow , focus on the experiences of black people in this country. People on the left correctly emphasize the prison boom's devastating impact on people of color, who are policed, prosecuted, and sentenced more aggressively than white people. Transformational change requires fighting institutional racism. But excessive incarceration also occurs in predominantly white, Republican states.\n\nTo expand the reform movement's ranks, professor James Forman Jr., the author of Locking Up Our Own , suggested that progressives should recruit white conservatives to speak about their experiences with the criminal legal system. Activists should highlight these perspectives without downplaying the system's disproportionate impact on minorities or neglecting nonwhite perspectives in policy negotiations.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, championed the First Step Act because his father, Charles, suffered in federal prison. In addition, a 2017 poll revealed that 54 percent of Trump voters know someone who is or has been behind bars. That statistic illustrates the prison boom's oppressive reach, but it also reveals an opportunity to assemble a broad reform coalition. A race-conscious movement amplifying diverse messengers would encourage all Americans to identify with people harmed by the carceral state.\n\n2. Build trust through collaboration and by recognizing conservatives' good intentions.\n\nSome progressives doubt that bipartisan criminal justice initiatives can combat racism in the legal system. Advocating reform in racial terms is a nonstarter for many conservatives, who consider racial-justice claims exaggerated or unnecessarily polarizing. This is a real obstacle. Still, people on the left can make progress by building rapport with conservatives through collaboration on shared policy goals. Once people across the aisle form connections, it is easier to have difficult conversations about race.\n\nProfessional relationships reduce the risk that conservatives will feel defensive when progressives bring up systemic racism. Vikrant Reddy, a senior research fellow at the Charles Koch Institute, told MTV that \"conservatives are really sympathetic to this notion that we have passed legislation that has had unintended consequences\" for racial minorities. At the same time, people on the right recoil at the notion that a \"shadowy cabal of Republicans\" attacked minority communities intentionally.\n\nProgressives should not hesitate to confront racism-intentional, unconscious, and institutional-in frank terms. But when trying to persuade Republicans to adopt reform, activists should treat them as potential partners in the solution.\n\n3. Appeal to the shared value of public safety.\n\nA common misconception is that conservative reformers care primarily about cutting prison spending. While cost is important, public safety is critical to conservative reform advocates and opponents. Mass incarceration would never have happened if fiscal restraint trumped tragically misguided arguments about security. According to the influential Right on Crime initiative, \"public safety is a core responsibility of government,\" and today's policymakers must deliver \"a better return on taxpayers' investments in public safety.\" Appealing to this shared value makes it easier for progressives to persuade conservatives.\n\nFraming reform in terms of public safety means changing minds about what keeps communities safe. Though almost all prisoners will be released eventually, our awful prison conditions leave many people damaged physically and psychologically. Moreover, housing and employment discrimination increase recidivism by preventing people with criminal records from earning a lawful living. A progressive public safety narrative explains that security depends on rehabilitation, re-entry, and dramatically reducing incarceration. Conservatives generally disfavor government interventions to remedy the conditions that cause crime, but they may support improving safety through criminal justice reform.\n\n4. Use civil forfeiture to demonstrate the need for police accountability.\n\nSome criminal justice topics are more contentious than others, and perhaps none is more divisive than policing. But even in this context there is potential for bipartisan change. According to Chuck DeVore and Randy Petersen of the Texas Public Policy Foundation (home to Right on Crime), civil forfeiture is a gateway issue for getting conservatives to back police reform. Civil forfeiture laws allow police to take and keep citizens' property if officers suspect that the item is involved in a crime. For instance, during a traffic stop, an officer could confiscate money found inside the driver's car, claiming that it was going to be used to buy drugs. Police can do this even if the property owner has not been convicted or even charged with wrongdoing. To recover the property, a citizen must prove in a civil proceeding that the property was not involved in a crime-there is no presumption of innocence. People across the political spectrum oppose this practice.\n\nThe Supreme Court just ruled that forfeitures to state police can be unconstitutional \"excessive fines.\" However, officers can still take property from innocent people if the forfeiture is not deemed excessive. While civil forfeiture is a narrow slice of America's police misconduct problem, challenging it has broader benefits. A campaign against civil forfeiture may undermine blind faith in law enforcement and enlarge the pool of people interested in combatting police abuses.\n\nExpanding support for reform is vital in states where progressives cannot enact policy on their own. With strategic bipartisanship, activists can slowly but surely improve the criminal legal system.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Republican Arguments Against D.C. Statehood Aren't Getting Any Newer-or Any Less Racist\n\nAt Thursday's House committee hearing on D.C. statehood, Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told D.C. lawmakers they were too incompetent and corrupt to run a state government. The former Ohio State University wrestling coach, who recently orchestrated a cover-up to hide what he knew about a doctor who was sexually abusing athletes, kicked things off by reciting a list of former D.C. public officials who've been accused or convicted of corruption, including Marion Barry, D.C.'s infamous long-serving mayor who was busted for crack possession in 1990. This \"cloud of scandal,\" in Jordan's account, was the defining feature in the political life of a place unsuited to rule itself.\n\n\"Any discussion about the future of D.C. would not be complete without a discussion about the district's current challenges,\" Jordan said, citing the ongoing ethics investigation into the activities of D.C. Councilmember Jack Evans. Jordan brought up the federal oversight board established in 1995 and disbanded in 2001, which temporarily took the district's finances out of the hands of local leaders. \"I wish I could say the situation has improved\" since then, Jordan said, \"but this is not the case.\"\n\nDel. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the district's longtime nonvoting delegate to Congress, pointed out that \"nobody has seriously questioned Ohio's fitness to be a state\" even though it's had plenty of its own corrupt and power-abusing leaders over the years. (She stopped short of dragging Jordan for protecting an alleged molester and lying about it .) Nor has any other city whose budget has been temporarily controlled by an oversight board during a period of near-insolvency been threatened with permanent disenfranchisement.\n\nEfforts to keep home rule out of reach for D.C. have historically been motivated by racist beliefs-chiefly, the idea that a majority-black city, as D.C. was until recently, was unfit to govern itself-and used to enforce racist policies, such as segregation . And so, at Thursday's hearing, Jordan's invocation of Barry was a nod to conservatives who'd like to freeze D.C. in the Barry era in public memory: too corrupt and crack-ridden for the responsibilities of statehood. At times, Jordan and his party peers sounded like stern parents telling a misbehaving child why she wasn't mature enough to visit the mall on her own. The D.C. officials who testified spoke in sweeping, patriotic language about rights, suffrage, and equal representation; the Republicans met them with condescension and a scolding.\n\nRoger Pilon, a vice president at the libertarian Cato Institute who'd been brought in to testify against statehood, laid the groundwork for his testimony in a 2016 essay he wrote in opposition to statehood. In that piece, he argued that D.C. residents valued their voting rights less than their ability to influence policy \"simply by virtue of their daily proximity to the organs and levers of national power.\" (Tell that to the janitor who cleans the Senate restrooms.) He also sounded a note of contempt for the self-governing capacity of D.C. residents-or, at least, the D.C. residents of 34 years earlier. \"The 58-page constitution that D.C. voters ratified in 1982, including provisions that require the new state to provide jobs or adequate incomes to all city residents and allow firefighters and police the right to strike, does not give confidence,\" he wrote.\n\nRepublicans have called that old constitution, which was written when Barry made the district's first push for statehood, a liberal manifesto . The article Pilon links to mentions the striking and guaranteed-income provisions only in the context of their waning popularity when the constitution was reconsidered, just five years after it was ratified. When D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other local political leaders convened to draft a new one in 2016, they came up with a far more politically neutral document.\n\nBut Pilon and his ideological peers chose to make partisan arguments against a caricature of the district rather than face the inconvenient plight of 700,000 Americans who live under taxation without representation. Two hours in on Thursday, when Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-V.A., pointed out Republican efforts to disenfranchise people of color and then refused Pilon's request to back down from saying \"it's about race and partisanship,\" the crowd applauded at finally hearing the subtext made text.\n\nTill then, through those two hours, several of the Republican committee members had spent their allotted time offering racially coded arguments against equal voting rights and representation for the district's 700,000 or so residents. According to them, D.C.'s politicians were too corrupt, its school system too weak, and its murder rates too high for its residents to warrant representation in the federal legislative bodies that govern their lives.\n\nIt's been 26 years since the last time statehood came before Congress, in 1993, when the bill proposing the full enfranchisement of D.C. residents failed in a vote, 277 to 153. Norton said at the time that the vote had \"surpassed my greatest expectations,\" even though 40 percent of her fellow Democrats had voted against the bill. The bill that came before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on Thursday, H.R. 51 , is poised to fare much better than Norton's previous legislation. It currently has 220 cosponsors- more than enough to pass the House. It almost certainly won't make it to the Senate floor as long as Sen. Mitch McConnell, who's called the prospect of D.C. statehood \" full-bore socialism ,\" is in charge. But it's an important victory-part symbolic, part substantive- for advocates who've been pushing for decades to expand the Overton window on D.C. statehood.\n\nAnd yet, for all that's changed in D.C. and the country since that first statehood vote, the arguments opponents made at Thursday's hearing were faithful reprises of the 1993 talking points. Back then, Rep. Tom DeLay accused D.C. of having \"a hug-a-thug attitude on violent crime\" and being \"a liberal bastion of corruption and crime.\" On Thursday, Glenn Grothman, R-W.I., said the same thing. He talked about D.C.'s high homicide rates and low student test scores relative to the 50 states-a deceptive and inaccurate comparison, since no existing state is entirely a city.\n\nGrothman also told the D.C. lawmakers in attendance that their recent legalization of sports betting, which could bring loads of money into the city's coffers, was not \"a sign you have your act together.\" D.C. should be \"the easiest city in the country to manage, because you have so many government jobs here,\" he said. \"It's not like you're a city like I was born in, where you can have manufacturing jobs disappear and real challenges happen.\" Grothman was born in Milwaukee, which has its own troubles with disenfranchisement .\n\nFor as long as congressional Republicans have been admonishing D.C. lawmakers for being unable to run their own supposedly easy-to-manage city, they've been blocking them from effectively doing so. Congress once banned D.C. from using any public funds-including its own municipal funds-for needle exchange programs, even in the midst of an HIV epidemic; a study found that in the two years after that ban was lifted, the new programs prevented 120 new HIV cases , saving the city $44 million in lifetime health care costs. (Now that the opioid epidemic has led to rising HIV rates among white injection drug users, Republicans are coming around to syringe exchange programs.) Congress also fought D.C. when it tried to decriminalize marijuana and fund abortion care for low-income women-policies that would have disproportionately supported its black residents.\n\nWith this history in mind, and considering McConnell's explicit admission that Republicans should oppose D.C. statehood because of the politics of its residents, it would make sense for statehood supporters to go all in on a racial justice argument for statehood. A few of the Democrats at Thursday's hearing started heading that way. \"Yes, it is true that we are more brown and more liberal than some of you, but denying statehood would be unfair no matter who was affected,\" Bowser said in her opening statement. \"It would be unfair if we were conservatives from a rural district built around agriculture, or an industrial city in the heartland.\" She didn't have to say the other part-that rural white conservatives are over- enfranchised in the Senate and the Electoral College, and that there's no way the U.S. Congress would have made it to 2019 without giving a sizable majority-white city a single seat in the House.\n\nAs the New York Times columnist and former Slate writer Jamelle Bouie has noted , the Republicans' show of concern over D.C.'s supposed incapacity to manage itself sounded a lot like the whites who trashed black self-governance and argued against full political citizenship for black people during Reconstruction. (In their framing of equal rights as a punitive threat to the current balance of power, they sounded a bit like Andrew Johnson himself, too.) At Thursday's hearing, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., attempted to connect D.C.'s history as a migration destination for formerly enslaved people with its fruitless struggle for political power. \"It is a profound injustice and a sick irony of our history that the [descendants of] people who fled here to the District of Columbia to flee slavery because of the enlightenment of this community are now disenfranchised because of that very act,\" she said. Statehood opponents can dog-whistle and deny the racial motivations for D.C.'s disenfranchisement all they want, but they can't deny its racial impact. In partisan efforts to deny majority-minority communities full voting rights, the difference between what they're doing and what they want to feel like they're doing doesn't much matter.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Conservative Case for Reforming the Police\n\nPhoto by Eric Thayer/Reuters\n\nIf a neoconservative is a liberal who has been mugged by reality, as Irving Kristol once put it, what do you call a conservative faced with video footage of the chokehold death of Eric Garner, a man the New York Police Department confronted for the crime of selling contraband cigarettes?\n\nIn the wake of the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, conservatives and liberals found themselves taking familiar stances. Those on the right were by and large inclined to give a local police officer the benefit of the doubt. Those on the left maintained that use of lethal force against Brown was unjustified, and that the failure to indict Darren Wilson reflected the deeply ingrained racism of the American criminal justice system.\n\nThe case of Garner has met with a strikingly different response from conservatives, as Tim Lee of Vox recently observed . Bill O'Reilly of Fox News, a man known for channeling the populist id of older white conservatives, somberly expressed his horror at Garner's death on Wednesday night. More pointedly, Tim Carney, a leading light of the conservative intelligentsia and a columnist for the Washington Examiner , pointed to Garner's death of an illustration of the dangers of an unaccountable, excessively strong government.\n\nHaving grown up in Brooklyn in the 1980s and lived through the explosion of violence that accompanied the crack epidemic, I came to deeply appreciate the dangerous and difficult work done by the NYPD. Like most conservatives, my gut-level sympathies are with police officers who find themselves in situations that can quickly spiral out of control. And I believe that the most important job of the police is to protect innocent people from harm, a job the NYPD has generally done well. But there is no question that something has gone badly wrong with policing in many of our cities. When high-crime neighborhoods grow to distrust local law enforcement, local law enforcement finds it more difficult to do its job. Anger and anxiety build, and sometimes it explodes.\n\nOf course, conservative fears about law enforcement run amok are different from those invoked by liberals. Conservatives, particularly libertarian-minded conservatives, are far more likely to point to the expansion of government as a driver of police abuses, a claim that at least some liberals find risible, or even offensive . Moreover, they are far less likely to chalk up police brutality to straightforward racism. Fear of the police, a fact of life for young black and brown men-particularly those living in neighborhoods plagued by violent crime, ironically enough-is largely unknown on the American right, which is disproportionately white and either suburban or rural.\n\nYet it is an oversimplification to see our excessive reliance on punitive crime-control policies through a racial lens. Consider the invaluable work of James Forman Jr., a clinical professor at Yale Law School, who has argued that black Americans played a larger role in the rise of \"broken windows\" policing and mass incarceration than is commonly understood.\n\nForman has recounted the role of Harlem-based black activists in the late 1960s in pushing for New York state's notorious Rockefeller drug laws. Those laws imposed draconian sentences for drug offenses and set the tone for a wave of similar tough-on-crime measures that spread around the country in the years that followed. He details the rise of more punitive policies in black-majority jurisdictions with black-majority police forces, focusing in particular on Washington, D.C. Forman's work absolutely does not prove that racism played no role in the incarceration boom that has done so much to devastate poor black neighborhoods. Rather, he reminds readers that the fact that young black men face shockingly disproportionate rates of violent crime had led a not inconsiderable number of black Americans to embrace tough-on-crime policies. The fear of crime that drove these policies was not unique to whites, and it is not just whites who bear responsibility for the many ways these policies have gone wrong.\n\nIf conservatives accept that the worst excesses of law enforcement need to be reined in, what are the appropriate next steps? And is there room for common ground with liberals who see the roots of the dysfunction of our criminal justice system very differently?\n\nThere are grounds for optimism. In 2012, Steven Teles and David Dagan described how a coalition of conservative policy entrepreneurs and GOP elected officials had set out to reduce incarceration levels, having grown troubled by the ugly moral consequences of separating fathers, boyfriends, and husbands from their families. This impulse needs to inform every aspect of policymaking around criminal justice.\n\nWhat government routinely fails to do is account for the costs the criminal justice system imposes on the civilians who get caught in its web. Mark A.R. Kleiman, a public policy professor at UCLA and author of When Brute Force Fails , made this point vividly in a Democracy Journal essay published last spring . Instead of fixating on the dollar costs of running the criminal justice system, he asks that we also account for \"the suffering inflicted by arrest, prosecution, conviction, and incarceration, including all of the residual disabilities that go with the label 'ex-convict,' and the fear created by overaggressive policing.\"\n\nImagine if, as Cardozo Law School professor Richard A. Bierschbach has suggested, we had in place a \"punishment budget.\" Given such a budget, we would accept that the criminal justice system would cause some degree of suffering. At the same time, we'd insist that if you pass some measures that increase suffering in some way-say, by making more arrests-you'd have to reduce the sum total of suffering in some other way, for instance by reducing prison sentences for nonviolent offenders. This would impose a useful check on the creep of new laws, rules, and regulations that steadily increase the government's coercive powers, as if on autopilot.\n\nEstablishing a punishment budget is only the first step that the right can and should rally around. The second is insisting on greater transparency. We need better, more reliable data on policing so that communities have a clear sense of what local law enforcement agencies are doing in their name. The chief resistance to greater transparency comes from police unions. Conservatives, who've long been critical of public sector unions for imposing rigid work rules and contributing to soaring compensation costs, should have no qualms about calling for their abolition. When teachers unions fight tooth and nail on behalf of teachers accused of misconduct, it's a problem. When police unions do the same on behalf of police officers accused of endangering the lives of civilians, and in some cases killing them, it's a very big problem indeed. Republicans are often wary of curbing the collective bargaining rights of public safety employees, due to their political influence and their conservative sympathies. That has to change.\n\nThe third step is to encourage a more localized approach to criminal justice, an idea that's been championed by Bierschbach and by Stephanos Bibas of Penn Law School. Both have pointed to the encouraging example of the Red Hook Community Justice Center , a court that employs people with a deep knowledge of their Brooklyn neighborhood, and that is more likely to mandate community supervision than to send low-level offenders to jail. Because the men and women who work for the center know the neighborhood so well, they have a better sense of which offenders represent a serious and ongoing threat to law-abiding citizens and which need nothing more than structure and discipline in their lives. Better still, the center's approach leads local residents to think of it as an ally working to keep the neighborhood safe rather than as an enemy looking to snatch away their troubled young men.\n\nThe community court model is no panacea. It works better in some places than others. But it does resonate with many of the things that conservatives care about most: It makes use of the \"little platoons\" of civil society, it respects local priorities and values, and there is at least some evidence that it's much cheaper than business as usual. If local law enforcement is ever going to become more humane and more legitimate, becoming more local is absolutely essential.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Tim Scott is 2024's only Black Republican candidate, and he wants America to focus less on race\n\nA major speech he recently gave at a Black church faced tough questions.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott is the only Black candidate vying for the GOP's presidential nomination and while he has talked openly about race in America -- sometimes seizing the moment to challenge his competitors -- his messaging on the issue hasn't often separated him from the other candidates in the field.\n\nSince he's launched his bid for the White House, Scott, like his Republican rivals, has leaned into his belief that America is \"not a racist country\" and his opposition to so-called \"critical race theory\" and other views that emphasize identity.\n\n\"Joe Biden and the radical left are attacking every rung of the ladder that helped me climb,\" he said in his campaign launch speech , in May.\n\n\"When I cut your taxes, they called me a prop. When I re-funded the police, they called me a token. When I pushed back on President Biden, they even called me the N-word,\" he said. \"I disrupt their narrative. I threaten their control. The truth of my life disrupts their lies!\"\n\nIn October, Scott deviated from usual stops in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina to visit a Black church on the South Side of Chicago.\n\n\"There is a radical movement on the far left, and the more progress that America makes on race, the more some leaders want to deny it,\" Scott told the congregants of New Beginnings Church. \"Our country has made, however, tremendous strides since then on the issue of race -- but lawlessness and fatherlessness and joblessness have gotten worse in the last 60 years and not better.\"\n\nHis speech in Chicago was intended, in part, to clarify controversial remarks he made at the second Republican Primary debate in September. Scott drew criticism then after he appeared to suggest that President Lyndon B. Johnson's \"Great Society\" federal welfare program in the '60s had been more difficult for Black Americans than slavery.\n\nFormer Republican National Committee Chair Michael Steele, who is Black, called Scott's debate comments a \"load of crock.\"\n\nHis more than an hourlong speech at New Beginnings Church also called out Democratic leadership in Chicago for, in his view, failing the Black community. Many of those elected officials are Black.\n\n\"If everything can be based and blamed on systemic racism, the problems can't be the liberals' fault,\" Scott told the audience. \"They want us to sit down, shut up and don't forget to vote as long as we're voting blue. Instead of solutions, we are offered distractions and division.\"\n\nAfterward, attendees were eager to pepper Scott, who rarely addresses Black audiences on the campaign trail, with tough questions. Many of the exchanges were tense.\n\nAttorney Rodrick Wimberly said he came to the church with his wife, Evelyn, \"out of respect\" for what Scott has accomplished. When it was his turn to speak with the South Carolina senator, Wimberly challenged Scott.\n\n\"I've seen both in the debate and also in statements you've made where you indicated that you don't feel that there's systematic racism,\" he said. \"There is statistical data to show, or suggest at the very least, that there is some issue where it's systemic.\"\n\nScott told him, \"I'm saying that there is racism, but it's not the system.\"\n\nThe pair went back and forth on education, redlining -- referring to discrimination in financial loans -- and inequities in wealth before Scott was ushered away by his staff.\n\nAfter the conversation, Wimberly told ABC News he came that day open to voting for Scott, but after their interaction he and his wife wouldn't cast a ballot for him \"at this time.\"\n\nThe disconnect illustrates a challenge Scott, and more broadly the Republican Party, has in making significant inroads with Black voters. In the last presidential election, 87% of Black voters backed Democrat Joe Biden, according to ABC News' exit polling.\n\nNadia Brown, a political scientist and professor at Georgetown University argued that Scott's messaging on race is most likely not directed at Black voters at all.\n\nInstead, the senator, who has struggled so far to gain traction in the polls, is pitching himself as a non-white candidate who agrees with the issues that motivates the GOP base, Brown said.\n\nThe vast majority of Republican primary voters (92%) were white in 2020, the last presidential election year, according to a 538 analysis.\n\n\"What Tim Scott and those of his ilk are doing, they're trying to play on these emotional push pins that most African Americans don't see. It's not landing for them,\" Brown said. \"I think that is a call out to other conservatives, particularly white conservatives, who want to say, 'I have a Black senator,' or, 'I feel comfortable voting for a Black candidate.'\"\n\nIn rare moments, Scott has cited his race to break from others in the Republican primary field.\n\nIn July, he criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for supporting a change to the state's standards that directed educators to teach middle school students enslaved people \"developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit.\"\n\nScott suggested to reporters that DeSantis should rethink his position. \"What slavery was really about was separating families, about mutilating humans and even raping their wives. It was just devastating,\" he said.\n\n(DeSantis has defended the standards, telling ABC News' Linsey Davis in September: \"It was not saying that slavery benefited. It was saying that these folks were resourceful.\")\n\nThough the audience for his Chicago speech was predominantly Black, the crowds at Scott's typical campaign stops are overwhelmingly white. At those events, Scott often declares that he will \"speak like a pastor,\" in the famous tradition of Black clergy.\n\nLeah Wright Rigueur, a history professor at Johns Hopkins University and author of \"The Loneliness of the Black Republican,\" analyzed how Scott presents himself in the primary field.\n\n\"Because Tim Scott doesn't have certain markers of what the Republican base wants in a candidate, he's not white and he's not married, he plays up on other things: He plays up certain tropes about Black people and he leans into this kind of religious identity that I think really brings out a comfort for white audiences,\" Wright Rigueur said.\n\n\"[Scott] has to talk about race, but he has to do it in a way that doesn't alienate the main players in the party, and that's extremely hard to do given that the standard line on race in the party right now is that 'we don't have a problem and in fact it's other people who are the real racists,'\" Wright Rigueur told ABC News.\n\nIn response to Scott's speech at the Chicago church, Rep. Jonathan Jackson, D-Ill., who is Black and represents part of the city in Congress, told ABC News, \"He's trying to capitulate and kowtow to an extremist right wing group, and he ought to be ashamed of himself.\"\n\nWhen criticized for his stance on race, Scott responds with an oft-repeated refrain placing the blame on the political left for, he argues, trying to silence another view.\n\n\"I've been called a prop, a token, the N-word and more ugly names than I can share,\" Scott said in a recent fundraising appeal.\n\nOther Black conservatives agree with Scott's sentiments.\n\n\"It's quite obvious what America's past has been, but there's nobody alive today that could sit up and say, 'Well, I didn't develop into my full potential because I wasn't given an opportunity,'\" said Raynard Jackson, a Republican political consultant, who is Black. \"I think [Scott] hit all the right notes in the right key.\"\n\nWilliam Oden, chairman of the Sumter, South Carolina, Republican Party, who is also Black, voted for Scott in his Senate bid and loves Scott's \"optimistic message.\"\n\n\"His message dispels the rumor that people talk about our country being racist,\" Oden said.\n\nAlthough Scott had told ABC News that his team discussed giving his Chicago church speech \"for a very long time,\" he delivered it amid signs that his campaign is faltering.\n\nA super PAC supporting Scott announced it would pull fall ads from TV and he's still polling in the single digits nationally as well as in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, according to 538's average . He only just managed to qualify for the third Republican primary debate, set for Wednesday.\n\nBefore Scott's Chicago speech, his team held a call to announce a plan to shift resources from New Hampshire and increase staffing in Iowa so that they were equipped to go \"all in.\" Campaign manager Jennifer DeCasper also joined him in the city, in a rare appearance to signal what the campaign saw as a major moment.\n\nDeCasper is the only Black woman at the helm of a Republican presidential campaign this cycle and some point to the diversity within Scott's staff as an illustration of his commitment to communities of color.\n\n\"Tim doesn't just believe in diversity. He is diverse,\" said Jackson, the consultant. \"If you go to his office, it's nothing but the definition of diversity, and it's not forced or contrived diversity. That's just who he is.\"\n\nWright Riguer, the history professor, said that DeCasper is an important reflection of how Scott is approaching the issue.\n\n\"Given that there was a Black woman who is essentially guiding his larger political future, that is really important for how he is thinking and talking about race right now,\" she said.\n\nScott's campaign declined to comment for this article.\n\nHis recent remarks at the University of Mississippi are perhaps most emblematic of how he will continue to address the topic of race in a party that de-emphasizes identity.\n\n\"I don't want to be the Black conservative. I don't want to be the Black southerner,\" he said in late October. \"I want to be Tim Scott, who happens to be Black.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Kerry also did less well with independents; indeed Edwards battled him to a dead heat among independents in Tennessee.\n\nBut Kerry's strengths more than compensated. He won half the military veterans in both states - of possible interest in light of the Bush/National Guard imbroglio.\n\nKerry won five of six issue groups in Tennessee and all six in Virginia, where he showed special strength - more than in any previous state - among voters most concerned about health care issues. He also did especially well with seniors in both states, and with black voters, a core Democratic constituency.\n\nOther results were on the same track.\n\nIn Virginia just two in 10 called it \"very likely\" John Edwards could beat Bush; by contrast, about six in 10 called it \"very likely\" Kerry could win.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "How to combat vaccine misinformation and beat COVID-19: Opinion\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to mass vaccination is disinformation.\n\nLast week marked one year since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. For more than 500,000 Americans, the pandemic ended their lives. And for the millions of family members and friends who lost a loved one, the suffering and hardship will remain a part of them.\n\nToday's safe and effective vaccines are our way out of this pandemic, yet the extent of misinformation and disinformation around them and experts' recommendations has been significant, even somewhat surprising. It's time to unify all trusted messengers and vaccine advocates to combat misinformation and beat COVID-19.\n\nAs primary care doctors in Dallas and Chicago, we hear the myths perpetuated on Facebook, WhatsApp and YouTube in the form of questions from our patients every single day. As health care providers, we're used to answering questions from patients about prevention, diagnoses, treatments, and complications. However, there has been a noticeable shift where some patient questions seem to reflect targeted efforts to undermine trust in the vaccine.\n\nFor example: a patient was concerned that his preexisting conditions would lead to side effects from the vaccines when, in fact, exactly the opposite is the case. This patient with several underlying conditions had an even higher risk of hospitalization or death from COVID. These patients are exactly the ones who benefit greatly from vaccination and help curb the spread of the disease.\n\nIt's hard to blame patients for asking these questions, as many of them are unknowingly targets of coordinated disinformation campaigns online. The false information not only influences medical decisions on an individual level, but also when perpetuated through a community can further contribute to vaccine hesitancy.\n\nHesitancy may be particularly acute in communities of color, like the ones we serve, due to a mistrust of the medical system due to unethical medical experiments among other factors. Meanwhile, polling shows that many white Americans -- particularly white conservatives -- may have reservations about getting vaccinated.\n\nApart from that, experts have told ABC News that social media posts with vaccine misinformation have become normalized since the start of the pandemic -- increasing in frequency and appearing alongside content that is less extreme. Even though Americans become more willing to get vaccinated, 1 in 5 said they were reluctant to do so , according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll last month.\n\nIn order to unify our country and get back to doing the things we love and miss most, we need trusted messengers to deliver trusted messages. That includes not only physicians and health care providers who are trusted by more than 85% of Americans when it comes to the COVID-19 vaccine, but also church leaders, educators and community leaders. It includes everyone and anyone who supports science.\n\nIt's going to take each and every one of us to share and spread accurate, high-quality information about the vaccine, answer important questions, and shift the focus away from misinformation.\n\nThat is why we and our colleagues in health care across the country have teamed up to start #ThisIsOurShot, a grassroots social media campaign to elevate the voices of health heroes to build vaccine trust for a COVID-free world.\n\nWe are in a race between the virus and vaccines. If we want to reach herd immunity and get back to things we love and miss, as well as keep people safe, we have to take on the critical task of sharing accurate information about the vaccines so that, when the time comes for our community members to get vaccinated, they're confident in their decision to get the shot.\n\nSome key messages to share to help in this effort:\n\n-All three approved vaccines are very effective and will protect us from COVID-19.\n\n-1 in 3 Americans have safely gotten at least one shot.\n\n-According to the latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, once vaccinated, we can safely socialize with other vaccinated individuals without masks.\n\n-Urge those with questions to speak with their personal health care provider. They can also visit getvaccineanswers.org to get answers to common questions from trusted scientific experts.\n\nWe encourage all health heroes and vaccine advocates to join us in this effort to reach our friends, family, and communities. It's now or never. If indeed, we have enough vaccine for every adult in America by the end of May, then we have just a matter of months to make 2021 that year we can celebrate in the future as the one where we beat COVID-19.\n\nDr. Hussain Lalani, MPH, is an internal medicine physician in Dallas and co-founder of #ThisIsOurShot.

      "text": "Voters with literacy issues face challenges as midterm elections near\n\nStart Here speaks with ProPublica's Annie Waldman about recent cases.\n\nAs the midterm elections near, election rights advocates have sounded the alarm about what they say are serious cases of voter intimidation and restrictions against voters who have trouble reading their ballot.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, election officials have scaled back the number of people and resources used to help those voters at polling stations read and properly cast their ballot.\n\nABC News' \"Start Here\" spoke with ProPublica's Annie Waldman, who's been covering the issue and talked about recent cases that have taken place, particularly in Southern states.\n\nSTART HERE: When we talk about voter illiteracy, how big of an issue is that really? Are you telling me there are actually people out there who are voting [and] who can't read?\n\nANNIE WALDMAN: That's right. This is not a small group of people. According to the data for the National Center for Education Statistics, there are about 48 million Americans adults, about one-fifth of the adult population, who struggle to read at a basic level.\n\nAdults born outside of this country are disproportionately represented, but about two-thirds of adults with low reading skills were born in the United States. So it's not just people who immigrated to our country who were struggling with English.\n\nAnd this actually impacts their ability to vote. It impacts their ability to understand names on the ballot, impacts somebody's ability to understand registration dates and what's required and where to fill out forms. What is in place in our federal laws is that we are guaranteed that if we struggle to read, we can have somebody help us at the ballot box and help us vote.\n\nBut people aren't always aware that this is a federal right. That assistance is something that is protected by federal law.\n\nSTART HERE: When we talk about like these sort of volunteers, what does that mean? They're at the polls on Election Day saying like, \"Hey, I'll read your ballot to you if you want?\"\n\nWALDMAN: Yeah, that's right. There are people out there who [are] sitting an appropriate distance away from the actual ballot box. Um, but they are there to help you read if you struggle at the ballot box. Also, poll workers are sometimes allowed to help you read your ballot if you struggle.\n\nThere are a number of states which are making it even harder to provide assistance.\n\nThere [are] a number of states have actually made it harder for people to vote.\n\nOver the past two years, because of the myth of election fraud, states have proposed new restrictions. While they don't all target voters who struggle to read, they do make it especially challenging. For example, Georgia passed a law last year limiting who can even return or even touch an absentee ballot.\n\nFlorida also expanded the radius around election locations in which volunteers are actually prohibited from asking people if they need help. And Texas passed a law which prohibits voter assistance. So people who are trying to help people who struggle to read from answering questions or paraphrasing complicated language on a ballot.\n\nEven though a federal judge struck most of this law down, there's still remnants of it in place that really suppress people from trying to help others.\n\nIt's not just the laws themselves, but actually the prosecution of people who are trying to help people vote. We stumbled upon the story of Olivia Coley Pearson. She's a city commissioner in Coffee County in Georgia, and she's made it her mission to make sure that everybody in her community who wants to vote has an opportunity to do so. And she's been helping them for decades. But over the past 10 years or so, she's been prosecuted twice for trying to help people at the ballot box.\n\nSTART HERE: She's been prosecuted? What do you get prosecuted for?\n\nWALDMAN: That's right. In 2012, the chair of her Board of Elections in her county where she lives filed a complaint against her and a handful of other volunteers, essentially accusing them of helping people who \"didn't qualify for help.\" Georgia law only allows for voters to actually receive assistance if they are disabled or cannot read English.\n\nAnd so the Secretary of State's office...they investigated Olivia to make sure that she was fairly helping people who actually needed help. They found that there were a number of voters who said that they couldn't read and did need help, but there were also voters who requested help regardless of their ability to read.\n\nThe actual Secretary of State's office state election board chose not to recommend her case for criminal prosecution, but the local district attorney prosecuted her anyway, charging her with two felonies. This trial ended up in a hung jury, and when it was moved to another county, she was acquitted of all charges.\n\nThe sad thing is her saga did not end there. In 2020, when she was helping voters who struggled to read at the polls, she was arrested at the voting booth for supposed criminal trespassing. The charge hung over her for two years, but just earlier this year, the case was dropped. So again, you hear about these laws that are getting stricter in all these states that really limit assistance, but then you hear the story of Miss Coley Pearson, and that's what brings intimidation and suppression to the forefront. That's what we're looking at.\n\nSTART HERE: Is there a concern though because I understand that, like, people should be able to understand their ballot, should be able to make an informed choice. I'm just thinking of the worst-case scenario. Somebody shows up at your polling place, they say, \"Hey, I want to help you out.\" You're like, \"Thank goodness I need some help,\" and then they say, \"Vote for this, here's the list of people,\" and they just leave out the name of the Republican, or the name of the Democrat, or something like that.\n\nIsn't there a concern that if you got everyone going in the voting booth together, that you do end up getting bias and influence where there shouldn't be?\n\nWALDMAN: That's an interesting point that you bring up. In fact, conservative politicians have been using that as a rationale to actually crack down on voter assistance.\n\nSTART HERE: Trying to see all the angles here, yeah.\n\nWALDMAN: You know, as, as we all know, widespread voter fraud is actually a myth. That doesn't happen. And there are many people who are put in place to watch people vote, to make sure that they're accurately voting, [and] that they're voting in the right way in the polling booth to make sure that nobody's going to overstep their bounds. So, the case of this happening, it would be extremely rare, if at all.\n\nSTART HERE: In your reporting you noted that the majority of functionally illiterate adults in this country were born here...that there are sizable groups from all races...but that Black adults are overrepresented here. I mean is race an issue when we talk about how that affects voting?\n\nWALDMAN:: Yeah, we can't forget the history of voting rights in the South and when we're talking about what's happening today. About 50 years ago, Southern states forced literacy tests on voters to keep Black people out of the polls.\n\nAnd back then, local voting officials actually made exceptions for white people who couldn't read. It was really only in 1965 when Congress passed the Voting Rights Act prohibiting racial discrimination at the polls that some of this started to stop, but this did not stop White conservatives especially in the South from continuing to discriminate against voters, particularly those with low literacy skills who, due to centuries of oppression, were disproportionately Black.\n\nIn 1982, recognizing the importance of assistance at the polls, particularly for people of color, Congress amended the Voting Rights Act and affirmed that people are allowed to have assistance at the polls. But even though there was this kind of congressional affirmation of this in 1982, it wasn't enough to fully eradicate this kind of discrimination at the ballot box. We have reviewed lawsuits, and federal investigations, and we found numerous examples where the discrimination continues to this day.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Hillary Clinton expressed great concern about nuclear power, \"President Bush travels to Pottstown, PA for remarks on nuclear energy at the Limerick Generating Station -- scheduled for 3:20 pm ET,\" reports ABC News' Karen Travers, on break from lacrosse coverage.\n\n\"Limerick is a nuclear power plant located outside Philadelphia and owned by Exelon. According to a company web site, the Limerick nuclear plant produces approximately 2,400 net megawatts of electricity per hour, which is enough power for about 2 million homes.\"\n\n\"The President will take a tour of the plant before his speech. This is the President's third trip to a nuclear plant -- he visited the Calvert Cliffs nuclear power plant in Maryland on June 22, 2005 and the Detroit Edison Monroe Power Plant in Monroe, MI on Sept 15, 2003.\"\n\n\"The President will speak to about 250 people, mostly plant employees. There will be no new policy announcements.\"\n\nABC News' Polling Director Gary Langer writes, \"Public views on nuclear power are decidedly equivocal, sensitive both to positive arguments (about reducing dependence on foreign oil) and negative concerns (on safety and environmental impact). Energy dependence is at the forefront now, and the negatives have subsided from the post-TMI and Chernobyl days, but they remain a strong pull.\"\n\n\"In a Gallup poll in March, 55 percent supported 'expanding the use of nuclear energy,' up from 43 percent in 2003. But questions explicitly about building nuclear plants or providing government support for nuclear power find less support. Indeed in the same Gallup poll 55 percent opposed building a nuclear plant in their own area.\"\n\nCarrie Budoff and Amy Worde of the Philadelphia Inquirer report on the President's trip and why it isn't a definitively positive event for GOP candidates. \"Today, when Bush visits Philadelphia and Montgomery County, he will find a state party divided and weakened - a reversal that could complicate GOP efforts this year to keep its grip on the state legislature and perhaps even Congress.\" LINK\n\nKarl Rove headed to the Hill this morning to once again talk with Republican House members about immigration reform.

      "text": "Conservatives actually love critical race theory - when they turn the subject to 'oppressed' White people\n\nIf you're trying to figure out why so many conservatives despise critical race theory , here's some historical context you should remember:\n\nWhite conservatives oppose critical race theory -  only when it's applied to Black people.\n\nBut many have no problem adopting some of  CRT's language and core insights when complaining t hat contemporary America discriminates against White people.\n\nThis is the audacious double standard that's often overlooked in the current debate over critical race theory. Many White conservatives roll their eyes when Black people claim that systemic racism exists, that racism is baked into the nation's policies and legal system, and that it can't be reduced to individual prejudice - all key CRT concepts.\n\nYet White conservatives have steadily built a legal and political movement that claims White people are the primary victims of covert forms of racism embedded in American institutions such as religion, education, and throughout popular culture.\n\nThere's a name for this rhetorical sleight of hand, which insists that systemic racism exists for White Americans but not for people of color. Ta-Nehisi Coates, the renowned author and essayist, calls it \"frame-flipping.\"\n\nTrump called him 'my African American.' His life hasn't been the same since How 'good White people' derail racial progress Am I racist? You may not like the answer I covered the Rodney King riots. This moment feels different. That's why I'm afraid Coronavirus is bringing a plague of dangerous doomsday predictions Black America is being hammered by a double pandemic Her father was called 'the most dangerous racist in America.' She wants a different legacy for her son\n\nTrump called him 'my African American.' His life hasn't been the same since How 'good White people' derail racial progress Am I racist? You may not like the answer I covered the Rodney King riots. This moment feels different. That's why I'm afraid Coronavirus is bringing a plague of dangerous doomsday predictions Black America is being hammered by a double pandemic Her father was called 'the most dangerous racist in America.' She wants a different legacy for her son\n\nCoates says that while overt, ugly acts of bigotry attract the most attention, the most potent component of racism is \"positioning the bigot as the actual victim.\"\n\n\"So the gay do not simply want to marry, they want to convert our children into sin,\" he wrote. \"The Jews do not merely want to be left in peace, they actually are plotting world take-over. And the blacks are not actually victims of American power, but beneficiaries of the war against hard-working whites. This is a respectable, more sensible, bigotry, one that does not seek to name-call, preferring instead 'to' change the subject and strawman.\"\n\nThe recent debate over CRT is the latest variation of frame-flipping. But conservatives have used similar tactics to thwart the feminist movement and to notch victories in the culture wars on American campuses.\n\nCritical race theory is a perfect candidate for the latest version of frame-flipping because so many people do not know what it is - including some conservatives who condemn it.\n\nCritical race theory emerged in the 1970s as legal scholars and activists sought to figure out why racial inequality persisted despite the passage of landmark civil rights laws in the 1960s, which penalized the most blatant forms of discrimination. They concluded that racism had mutated and embedded itself in policies and institutions, such as housing and the justice system.\n\nThese modern forms of racism are what some call \"racism without racists .\" They are often hardwired into institutions, and can't be traced back to a White person being overtly racist. For example, a critical race theorist might point to an actual 2011 case of a lender caught charging Black and Latino customers higher fees than White applicants with similar credit histories.\n\nMany critics, though, ignore how CRT exposes how racism persists in the contemporary world. They say critical race theory \" poisons our discussion of race\" by suggesting that those who question CRT are automatically assumed to oppose fighting racism. They also argue it teaches White students to be ashamed of their color and country.\n\nConservative lawmakers have now passed laws in at least six states to ban what they describe as the teaching of critical race theory in public schools, with similar legislation being proposed in at least a dozen more. One commentator called this campaign the \"most far-reaching assault on academic freedom since the McCarthy era in the 1950s.\"\n\nBut it is something more. It is a textbook example of conservative hypocrisy.\n\nConservatives accuse critical race theorists of \" planting hatred in the minds of the next generation \" and being obsessed with skin color.\n\nYet many continue to rally behind a former President who is widely perceived to have spread hatred against Americans of color with such remarks as telling four nonwhite Democratic congresswomen to \"go back\" to the crime-infested places they came from and rose to political prominence partly based on a racist birther conspiracy theory that reflected his obsession with the first Black President of the US.\n\nConservatives admonish critical race theorists for saying racism transcends individual prejudice and is embedded in American institutions.\n\nYet they insist that White Americans are the victims of bias in such institutions as mainstream media, law schools and in corporate America, where some now say that White conservative men can't get ahead.\n\nConservatives say critical race theory teaches \" that Blacks should forever be regarded as helpless victims,\" and that \" America is not a racist country.\"\n\nYet they also warn of pervasive \"anti-White mania \" in America. A large number of Whites even say they face more discrimination than Black people, while a majority of White evangelicals say Christians face more discrimination than Muslims.\n\nThe battle over critical race theory is actually the latest outbreak of an older phenomenon: More White Americans in recent years have come to see themselves as a racially oppressed majority group .\n\nThis belief is reflected in how casually many White people use the language of racial persecution to describe their state in contemporary America, a fear that Trump has stoked for years.\n\nNumerous studies show that Blacks lag behind Whites in many socioeconomic categories. White people make up the bulk of the country's CEOs, billionaires and political leaders. There is no widely cited study showing that job applicants with a White-sounding name on their resume like Emily or Greg are 33% less likely to get called back for a job interview than a Jamal or Lakisha.\n\nStill, many White people talk today as if they are an embattled racial minority. Powerful White men lament they are increasingly \"being silenced by 'woke\" culture.\" Conservative politicians describe critical race theory as being as racist as \" Klansmen in White sheets\" and complain that Democratic voting proposals represent \" Jim Crow 2.0. \"\n\nOne conservative leader called it a \"monstrous evil\" that would enable people of color to rise up and use the \" whip handle\" on their White neighbors.\n\nWhite privilege is bogus, conservative commentators say, but \" Black privilege ,\" where Blacks get \"automatic victim status' that makes it easier for them to land affirmative action slots, is a real problem.\n\nCritics don't accept CRT's premise that systemic racism persists in contemporary America.\n\nLike critical race theorists, though, many see racism as a subtle and adaptable force woven into contemporary American institutions - except they believe these racist forces are arrayed against White people.\n\nThis new language of White persecution is no accident. It reflects in part real sentiments from White Americans who are anxious about demographic changes in their country. But it also reflects a strategy.\n\nMuch of this can be traced to conservative activist Christopher Rufo, who has vowed to lead a \"one-man war\" against critical race theory and has been open about his desire to turn CRT into a negative term.\n\nRufo wrote on his Twitter feed:\n\n\"We have successfully frozen their brand-\"critical race theory\"-into the public conversation and are steadily driving up negative perceptions. We will eventually turn it toxic, as we put all of the various cultural insanities under that brand category.\"\n\nBending left-leaning language and concepts to attack progressive reforms is something conservatives have been doing for centuries, political theorist Corey Robin argues in \"The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Donald Trump.\"\n\nIn his book, Robin looked at how conservative movements have traditionally specialized in absorbing \"the ideas and tactics of the very revolution or reform it opposes.\"\n\nRobin cited another cultural war battle that grabbed a lot of headlines not too long ago - the battle over political correctness on college campuses.\n\nHe says conservative leaders deftly advised conservative college students to use the language of the left to take on campus liberals. They accused colleges of lacking intellectual \"diversity,\" said conservatives were \"underrepresented\" and that schools should be more \"inclusive\" of right-leaning students.\n\nRobin also pointed to another conservative movement that borrowed the language of the left in the 1970s to defeat a progressive dream: The Equal Rights Amendment, an update to the Constitution that would have guaranteed equal rights to women.\n\nAfter the feminist movement of the 1960s, ratification for the Equal Rights Amendment seemed assured by the early 1970s. But Phyllis Schlafly, a conservative activist, led the successful campaign to torpedo the ERA movement by shrewdly using the language of the left.\n\nShe argued that the ERA would be \"a takeaway of women's rights,\" said she was defending \"the real rights of women\" and added, \"a woman should have the right to be in the home as a wife and mother.\"\n\nSchlafly used the language of human rights to \"put women back into the home,\" Robin noted. He says Schlafly's semantical maneuver was a common tactic of conservative movements, which, \"without directly engaging the progressive argument,\" absorb \"the deeper categories and idioms of the left.\"\n\nRush Limbaugh, the late conservative talk-show host, used the same rhetorical trick. He used the language of the civil rights movement to attack progressives. He once argued that conservatives are an \"oppressed minority\" in need of a \"civil rights movement\" because its members willingly sit in the \"back of the bus\" and were \"afraid of the fire hoses and the dogs.\"\n\nSome opponents of critical race theory are using the same ploy. They won't directly confront what critical race theorists actually say about incidents like George Floyd's murder and what it implied about the persistence of White supremacy in America. They simply absorb the language of critical race theorists to deflect and discourage any deeper discussions of systemic racism.\n\nThis was the point echoed by Sam Hoadley-Brill, a fellow at the African American Policy Forum, which is headed by the scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw , one of the founding scholars of CRT. He wrote in a recent essay:\n\n\"Today's attacks on critical race theory aren't meant to rebut its main arguments. They're meant to paint it with such broad brushstrokes that any basic effort to reckon with the causes and impact of racism in our society can be demonized and dismissed.\"\n\nThere is a legitimate debate to be had over critical race theory. Does it accurately reflect US history? Does it really teach hatred? And who gets to define racism: its perpetrators, or its victims?\n\nBut there is a segment of White conservative America that is not interested in debate. As they dismiss CRT as bogus - while employing its concepts and language to describe their own perceived racial oppression - the message they're sending to Black Americans, other people of color and their White allies is clear:\n\n\"Critical race theory for me - but not for thee.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "The Clarence Thomas myth that refuses to die\n\nIt's the horror movie villain that won't die, the pop song you can't get out of your head, the out-of-town guest that just won't leave.\n\nIt's a belief that's stuck like a tick in the collective memory of some white conservatives.\n\nIt's the notion that black people despise Clarence Thomas because he's a conservative.\n\nIt's not only a myth but a con. Here's why it matters now.\n\nWe are about to hear a lot about, and from, the only black member of the US Supreme Court. A new Thomas biography, \" The Enigma of Clarence Thomas ,\" is generating buzz. A new PBS documentary, \" Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words ,\" comes out next year. And a Washington Post writer recently dedicated an entire column to Thomas, calling him \"an American hero.\"\n\nIt's all adding up to another public reappraisal of arguably the most conservative member of the Supreme Court. He's someone more people would revere if they only knew him better, says columnist Kathleen Parker.\n\nHere's my question to people who say or imply black people revile Thomas because he's a conservative: If black people are so opposed to conservatives, why have so many accepted black conservatives such as Booker T. Washington, Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice?\n\nIf there is going to be a reevaluation of one of the most powerful black figures in the US, it's time we ground it in facts, not myths.\n\nThomas isn't despised in the black community because he's a conservative. Many dislike him because they see him as a hypocrite and a traitor.\n\nYet many white conservatives keep recycling the same selective stories about Thomas. These stories don't just distort black culture - they carry an undercurrent of racism.\n\nStart with the way conservatives celebrate Thomas' upbringing.\n\nThey love to tell tales about his rugged self-reliance: growing up in a Georgia shack without plumbing; the stern grandfather who worked him from sunrise to sunset and once told him that \"Old Man Can't is dead. I helped bury him.\"\n\nThese are stories worth telling. Thomas deserves credit. Not enough people, frankly, give him credit for something else, his intellect. Some liberal critics flirt with racism in the way they describe Thomas as an intellectual lightweight.\n\nBut the way some white conservatives tell the story of Thomas' rise from poverty also perpetuates racist stereotypes. They imply that Thomas and his hard working, no excuses grandfather are unusual characters in the black community. They depict Thomas as this lonely apostle of self-reliance, as if most black people prefer sitting on the couch drinking Kool-Aid while waiting for the government to send them a check.\n\nOne journalist praised Thomas in 2017 for being the product of a \"caring, supervised, value-laden upbringing, compared with a more usual poor, fatherless black childhood\" marked by \"victimhood.\"\n\nEven Thomas has reinforced this notion of pervasive black dependency. He gave a speech in the 1980s before a group of black conservatives where he said of his sister : \"She gets mad when the mailman is late with her welfare check. That`s how dependent she is. What`s worse is that now her kids feel entitled to the check too. They have no motivation for doing better or getting out of that situation.\"\n\nHis entire career is a result of thrusts for diversity that he would deny in others.\n\nLawrence Goldstone, author\n\nHere's some news:  Black people have been practicing self-reliance for centuries. We've had to, for survival. We know through bitter experience that white America's investment in racial equality is sporadic. Racial progress has always been followed by a \" whitelash .\"\n\nThomas' stern grandfather is a familiar figure in the black community. Plenty of black people can tell you stories of grandparents, pastors, teachers, and coaches who all preached the same message: Rely on yourself, because you can't rely on white people.\n\nIt's almost impossible to find a revered black leader who didn't preach some form of this message.\n\nEven President Obama, the so-called \" radial socialist \" who wanted to \" redistribute the wealth ,\" sounded many times like Thomas' grandfather.\n\nIt was Obama who chided black parents for allegedly feeding their children \"cold Popeye's\" chicken for breakfast and black boys for wearing a \"eight-pound chain around your neck.\" He once told a group of black college students , \"Nobody cares how tough your upbringing was. Nobody cares if you suffered some discrimination. And moreover, you have to remember that whatever you've gone through, it pales in comparison to the hardships previous generations endured.\"\n\nObama lectured black people so much about not using racism as a crutch that some commentators criticized him for it.\n\nBut you rarely, if ever, hear white conservatives acknowledge this history. They're still stuck on the Ronald Reagan \" Welfare Queen \" narrative about black dependency.\n\nThere's something else many white conservatives miss: The contradiction between Thomas' words and actions.\n\nThomas has lectured blacks about not defining themselves as racial victims. He once criticized civil rights leaders who he said, \" B*tch, b*tch, b*tch, moan and moan and whine \" about the Reagan administration.\n\nBut when his nomination to the Supreme Court was threatened by Anita Hill's allegations of sexual harassment, he played the race card by saying he was the victim of a \"high-tech lynching.\"\n\nThomas has lectured blacks about the evils of affirmative action. Yet he made it into Yale Law School because of an affirmative action program .\n\n\"His entire career is a result of thrusts for diversity that he would deny in others,\" Lawrence Goldstone, author of \"On Account of Race: The Supreme Court, White Supremacy, and the Ravaging of African American Voting Rights,\" told me.\n\n\"How many highly talented black or Hispanic kids are out there who could really make a difference if only the starting line was staggered to take into account how much baggage they're carrying.\"\n\nThen there was Thomas' public confrontation in 1991 with Anita Hill, the black woman who accused of him of sexual harassment. Many black women, in particular, still believe that he lied when he denied sexually harassing Hill. Thomas vigorously denied that he did anything wrong.\n\n\"A large portion, if not the majority, of black women over time began to think that Clarence Thomas may have in fact lied and that he almost certainly did,\" says Ravi Perry, chair of the political science department at Howard University.\n\nBut it's Thomas' voting record that has cemented the cynicism many blacks feel toward him.\n\nCritics say he has consistently voted against black people as well as other marginalized groups: women , LGBTQ people , religious minorities and death row inmates .\n\nHe is the first Supreme Court justice to openly criticize the high court's landmark civil rights ruling, Brown v. Board of Education.\n\nAnd he joined a 2013 high court decision - Shelby County v. Holder - that eviscerated the Voting Rights Act, the crown jewel of the civil rights movement.\n\nHere is Thomas providing a crucial vote to cripple legislation for which the proponents of racial justice marched, bled, and in some instances died.\n\nRandall Kennedy, author and law professor\n\nHis vote on Shelby contributed to \"the most unjustifiable and hurtful decision imposed on black America in the past half century,\" Randall Kennedy, an author and professor at Harvard Law School, wrote in a recent article on Thomas.\n\n\"It is atrocious, right alongside such judicial delinquencies as Plessy v. Ferguson, Giles v. Harris, and Korematsu v. United States,\" Kennedy wrote. \"Yet here is Thomas providing a crucial vote to cripple legislation for which the proponents of racial justice marched, bled, and in some instances died.\"\n\nYou won't hear many white conservatives address these deeper questions that many black people have about Thomas. Why is that?\n\nI have a theory. It's part of what I call the Clarence Thomas con - a way to divert people's attention away from the more unpleasant aspects of Thomas' legacy.\n\nIt's far easier to mislead the public about the true nature of Thomas' isolation in the black community than to defend accusations that his judicial decisions harm black people and other marginalized groups. Or to deny charges that his opposition to affirmative action is \"at war with his own biography.\"\n\nFocusing on Thomas' biography also takes away attention from his pessimistic views about integration and some white Americans.\n\nThere is nothing you can do to get past black skin. I don't care how educated you are, how good you are at what you do - you'll never ... be seen as equal to whites.\n\nClarence Thomas\n\nOne of the reasons why The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech still captivates people is because he portrayed a future America where whites and blacks would \"be able to sit down at a table of brotherhood.\"\n\nIt's a beautiful vision of an integrated America for which countless people literally died. But I wonder if many people understand Thomas' bleak view of racial progress.\n\nHe is a persistent critic of integration. He once said, \"The whole push to assimilate simply does not make sense to me.\"\n\nHe's also skeptical about white America's ability to see past skin color.\n\nHe once told a black reporter:  \"There is nothing you can do to get past black skin. I don't care how educated you are, how good you are at what you do - you'll never have the same contacts or opportunities, you'll never be seen as equal to whites.\"\n\nThomas believes that \"white supremacy is ineradicable in America,\" says Corey Robin, author of \"The Enigma of Clarence Thomas,\" a new biography that has earned widespread praise. \"Thomas does not believe that politics in any sense of that term - electoral politics, social movements, state action and regulation, organizing, even more radical notions of transformative change - can positively affect black people; he thinks politics mostly hurts black people.\"\n\nThomas was even unimpressed when the US elected Obama, the first black president. He said that a black person could only become president if the \"elites\" and \"the media\" picked him or her .\n\nThomas' skepticism about integration, though, is not rare in the black community. It's not uncommon to hear black people say in private that integration hurt them in some ways because their children were put into schools with white teachers who didn't believe in them, and their institutions were weakened.\n\nThomas alluded to this belief while talking about one of his heroes, Malcolm X, in a 1987 interview.\n\n\"I don't see how the civil-rights people today can claim Malcolm X as one of their own. Where does he say black people should go begging the Labor Department for jobs? He was hell on integrationists. Where does he say you should sacrifice your institutions to be next to white people?\n\nHere is where Thomas loses many black people.\n\nHe laments what black people lost due to integration. He praises black individuals like his grandfather who were able to build their own businesses and live with dignity despite segregation. Individual excellence seems to be his solution for racism.\n\n\"I am confident that the individual approach, not the group approach, is the better, more acceptable, more supportable and less dangerous\" approach to dealing with racism, Thomas once told a meeting of black lawyers .\n\nBut here's the not-so-big secret of segregation that people like Thomas never mention: \"Separate but equal\" never gave blacks anything that was actually equal. They could never get the same economic resources or political power under the \"separate but equal\" world of Jim Crow.\n\nHis grandfather might have lived a blameless life and become a millionaire. But he still could have been denied the right to vote, banned from entering white colleges or strung up by a lynch mob for something as absurd as \" reckless eyeballing \" during segregation.\n\nIndividual black excellence was never enough. Black people had to mobilize as a group to demand political power before life got better.\n\n\"You can't individually achieve your way out of racism. The remedy is collective,\" The New York Times columnist Charles Blow once wrote about Thomas.\n\nIf other black leaders had adopted Thomas' belief that they could never get past their dark skin, or that the individual approach was better, there would have been no \"Brown vs. Board of Education,\" no \"I Have a Dream,\" and no Obama.\n\nThere would have been no Thomas on the Supreme Court.\n\nThen there is another part of Thomas' persona that alienates some black people. White conservatives often portray him as a courageous truth-teller because he tells black people what they don't want to hear.\n\nHere's another truth they ignore: It doesn't take a lot of courage for a black person to tell powerful white people want they want to hear. In fact, they get plenty of rewards for doing so.\n\nI know this from a personal experience.\n\nI was a rookie reporter at a Southern newspaper when Thomas was nominated to the US Supreme Court in 1991. I was criticized by several black journalists after I wrote an essay defending Thomas. One famous black journalist called me a \"house n*****.\"\n\nI said then what I believe now: There is no one way to be black any more than there is one way to be white. Respect Thomas' decision to be an independent thinker.\n\nAfter my essay was published, a new world opened before me. A conservative white editor at the paper took me out to lunch and invited me to become an editorial columnist even though I was barely out of college. Interview requests poured in. I was invited to speak on national television. People thought I was a black conservative.\n\nI've seen this pattern over and over: If you're a black journalist who wants to lecture black people about not whining about racism and playing the victim, your career will blossom. Conservative institutions it seems will always find a place for black-on-black critics.\n\nCNN legal contributor Jeffrey Toobin touched on this part of Thomas' courageous truth-teller persona in a New Yorker profile of the Supreme Court justice. Toobin recounted a memorable speech by Thomas at a conservative, black-tie affair led by then Vice-President Dick Cheney. Thomas told the crowd that although he had suffered for speaking out, \"Be not afraid.\"\n\nToobin caps the story by saying:\n\n\"On this night, in other words, Thomas, while celebrating the courage to speak unpopular truths, was telling some of the most powerful people in the worlds of government, business, and finance precisely what they wanted to hear-that affirmative action was bad, that black people didn't want or need their help, that government did more harm than good.\"\n\nThomas has employed his powerful position not to speak truth to power, but to tell power what it wants to hear, according to many black people. That's why Thomas has been called the \" anti-Thurgood Marshall ,\" or the antithesis of the Supreme Court's first black justice.\n\n\"If you're a black person who rises to a high level in politics or law, many folks in the black community expect you to use that position to better the living conditions of people who look like you or at the very least speak truth to power,\" says Perry of Howard University.  \"Clarence Thomas has done neither.\"\n\nBut unlike Marshall, Thomas won't be widely celebrated in the black community. There likely won't be any movement to build schools, erect statues or name roads after him. His name was barely mentioned in the National Museum of African American History and Culture when it opened in 2016 (the museum said it couldn't tell \"every story\" of black America).\n\nYet his stature will probably grow as the Supreme Court's new conservative majority asserts itself. We will continue to hear stories about Thomas' work ethic, his stern grandfather, the price he paid for telling black people to stand on their own.\n\nThese stories, though, are decoys that lead people away from a richer discussion of Thomas' legacy - his impressive rise from poverty, yes, but also his contradictions, his scorn for integration, his belief that \"There is nothing you can do to get past black skin.\"\n\nDon't fall for the Clarence Thomas con.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Critical race theory has become a social and political lightning rod. This is how we got here\n\nFrom chaotic school board meetings to political strife along party lines, critical race theory has ignited a controversy across the country in recent months.\n\nAt least two dozen states have banned critical race theory or introduced legislation to ban it from being taught in the classroom, with many conservatives calling it a divisive concept. Educators, however, argue that critical race theory itself is generally not included in grade school curriculum.\n\nAnd proponents along with critical race theorists insist that the concept is largely misunderstood.\n\nRelated article What critical race theory is -- and isn't\n\nGary Peller, a professor at Georgetown Law and author of \"Critical Race Consciousness: Reconsidering American Ideologies of Racial Justice,\" said critical race theory acknowledges that racism is both systemic and institutional in American society and that White people have historically held racial power. Its origins date back to the late 1970s and early 1980s when legal scholars realized that advances in the civil rights movement did not eradicate racism, Peller said.\n\n\"Critical race theory starts from the realization... that simply taking down Whites only signs was not sufficient to end the effects of centuries of the subordination of African Americans in the United States,\" Peller said. \"And that there were other vestiges of racial power that remained.\"\n\nHere is a look at how critical race theory became a central issue this year and the uproar surrounding it.\n\nPeller and other political observers credit Christopher Rufo, a senior conservative research fellow and filmmaker, with injecting critical race theory back into American consciousness in 2020.\n\nRufo had done some research on diversity trainings for federal employees and said he believed critical race theory had \"pervaded\" every level of government.\n\nIn a Fox News interview in September 2020, Rufo said he called on then-President Donald Trump \"to immediately issue an executive order and stamp out this destructive, divisive, pseudoscientific ideology at its root.\"\n\nTrump would later denounce critical race theory himself and order a ban on teaching critical race theory in federal government trainings.\n\nThe move was widely criticized by federal employee groups who said Trump was promoting a misconception of diversity training meant to make workplaces more welcoming for employees of all races.\n\n\"Critical race theory is being forced into our children's schools, it's being imposed into workplace trainings, and its being deployed to rip apart friends, neighbors, and families,\" Trump said in September.\n\nRelated article The engineered conservative panic over critical race theory, explained\n\nBut Peller said critical race theory is too complex for grade school students to understand and that it's being conflated with conversations about diversity and equality. The concept is usually taught in law school or graduate school, he said.\n\nSome of Rufo's critics have accused him of purposely distorting the true nature of critical race theory.\n\n\"They are calling anything really having to do with race at all critical race theory,\" Peller said. \"And that's just incorrect.\"\n\nKimberlé Crenshaw, a founding critical race theorist and a law professor who teaches at UCLA and Columbia University, said the controversy is not about critical race theory but about America's racial anxiety.\n\n\"This is a classic situation where people have an itch to scratch,\" Crenshaw said. \"The itch is this concern about people of color demanding too much. The concern is about the consequences of the reckoning that happened last year to George Floyd . So this reaction is a backlash to the growing conversation about racial inequality.\"\n\nIn March, Rufo tweeted that he and other critical race theory opponents were \"steadily driving up negative perceptions\" of the concept.\n\n\"We will eventually turn it toxic, as we pull all of the various cultural insanities under that brand category,\" the tweet read.\n\nSince Rufo's comments in March, the critical race theory debate has exploded in school districts, leading to protests, riotous school board meetings, school board recall efforts, and educators being pushed out of their jobs.\n\nIn June, Loudoun County Public Schools in Virginia came under fire after chaos erupted during public comment at a school board meeting over claims that critical race theory was being taught in the classroom.\n\nParents and community members accused the school district of requiring teachers to take a diversity training that discusses the concept and then teaching it to students.\n\nSchool officials, however, said critical race theory was not part of their curriculum and that \"misconceptions and misinformation\" were distorting the equity work being done in the school district.\n\nCollege professor Julia Holcomb was at the school board meeting and said she was disturbed by the anti-critical race theory crowd. She is convinced it's no mistake it got out of hand.\n\n\"We're arguing about this because there are political forces that want us to be arguing about it,\" Holcomb told CNN.\n\nRelated article Critical race theory is a lens. Here are 11 ways looking through it might refine your understanding of history\n\nLoudon is now among several school boards across the country facing recalls from parent and political groups over critical race theory. Other school board recall efforts have been reported in the Mequon-Thiensville School District in Wisconsin and the Litchfield Elementary School District in Arizona.\n\nThe backlash from parents has also forced some educators to resign from their jobs, including a Black superintendent in Connecticut who was accused of pushing critical race theory on students after he helped lead efforts to change the racial climate in the district.\n\nAnd it's not just White conservatives blasting critical race theory.\n\nHarry Jackson was so determined to keep critical race theory out of his children's Virginia school district that he campaigned and became the first Black president-elect of the district's Parent Teacher Association.\n\n\"Advocates for critical race theory are even arguing that merit is racist, they argue that math is even racist,\" Jackson said. \"I am worried about the dumbing down of curriculum. I am worried about this forced equality. I don't think it works in other areas of the world. It certainly won't work in the United States.\"\n\nThe panic over critical race theory teachings has inspired some conservative groups to launch information campaigns and host seminars about the concept.\n\nThe Texas Public Policy Foundation , a non-partisan research institute dedicated to liberty, free enterprise, and personal responsibility, shared a flyer on Twitter in June that listed \"buzzworthy\" language for parents to look out for to determine whether critical race theory is being taught at their child's school. Some of the terms included equity, social justice, White privilege, Black lives matter and anti-racism. The foundation later deleted the tweet.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation released a video titled \"The Truth About Critical Race Theory\" that called it \"blatantly and unapologetically racist.\"\n\nIn Minnesota, Catrin Wigfall, a policy fellow for the Center of the American Experiment , is part of a statewide tour offering anti-critical race theory trainings.\n\nDuring one training, the audience took photographs of slides and diligent notes during Wigfall's presentation. Attendees also received a brochure with talking points to defend their opposition to critical race theory.\n\nActivist and educator Raj Sethuraju attended the meeting and thought the seminar itself was racist.\n\n\"Critical race theory fundamentally asks the question where do our laws come from and how it is informed by our racialized practices,\" Sethuraju said. \"Racist practices. Why are we not questioning that?\"\n\nBut most attendees, including grandparents and retired teachers, felt the seminar was spot on.\n\n\"There are racists in the country who do the wrong things but our country is not racist,\" said Pat Levander, a retired lawyer. \"That's the difference.\"\n\nMarge Lindberg, a retired teacher, agreed.\n\n\"You look under the surface and it really breeds hate more than unity and at a time when our country needs to work on unity,\" she said.\n\nCNN's Kimberly Berryman contributed.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "An author who studies diverse democracies shares what he sees as the future of the US\n\nAn army of commentators have rightly condemned a belief called \"replacement theory,\" which a young White man cited before killing 10 people, most of them Black, Saturday at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York.\n\nThose who subscribe to the theory - many of them White conservatives - believe a secret group of elites are using non-White immigrants and Black people to intermarry with and \"outbreed\" White people \"until they no longer exist.\"\n\nBut there is a variant of replacement theory that has also moved into the mainstream - and it's celebrated by people on the left as well, says Yascha Mounk , author of a provocative new book, \" The Great Experiment: Why Diverse Democracies Fall Apart and How They Can Endure.\"\n\n\"Over the past days ... (replacement theory) has, for very good reason, been widely condemned,\" Mounk says. \"But the uncomfortable truth is that a less conspiratorial cousin of it has long been embraced in mainstream public discourse. In fact, it is one of the few things that both liberals and conservatives, both Democrats and Republicans, can now agree on.\"\n\nMounk is talking about the belief that Democrats will become a permanent political majority in coming years as people of color and non-White immigrants eventually outnumber white Americans.\n\nSome progressives may cheer such a projection. But Mounk calls this belief the \"most dangerous idea in American politics.\"\n\nHe says it promotes a dystopian future in which White Americans and people of color are reduced to members of \"mutually hostile tribes,\" politicians have little incentive to reach beyond their base, and many Whites panic over the fear of being permanently sidelined.\n\nEven so, Mounk, who describes his political values as \"left of center,\" offers an optimistic vision of America's future in his new book. He explains why diverse democracies - countries with a multitude of racial and ethnic groups - sometimes fail, and how the US can succeed.\n\nDrawing on lessons from social psychology and countries as diverse as Lebanon and India, Mounk arrives at a surprising conclusion: A genuine, diverse democracy in the US, where all groups are treated fairly, is still a realistic goal.\n\n\"It is far too early to resign ourselves to a vision of the future in which most people will still eye anyone who has a different religion or skin color suspiciously; in which members of different identity groups have little contact with one another in their family lives; in which we all choose to emphasize the differences that divide us rather than the commonalities that could unite us,\" Mounk writes in \"The Great Experiment.\"\n\nThis issue is not abstract to Mounk. He was born into a Jewish family in Germany that was victimized by the same forces of hate that have destroyed many democracies.\n\nMounk, an authority on the rise of populism, recently spoke to CNN. His answers were edited for clarity and brevity.\n\nYou describe yourself as unfashionably optimistic. Why is that optimism so important when it comes to building a democracy?\n\nIf you look at the history of deeply diverse societies, they very often fall apart in violent ways or oppress minority groups within them in the most terrible manner. When you look at social psychology, you see how easy people find it to form groups and discriminate in favor of the in-group versus the out-group. So what we're trying to do here is really very hard, and we've often failed throughout American history.\n\nBut you can look at the current state of our society, and at the changes over the last few decades and recognize that there is a lot which justifies a hard-won optimism.  Our country is less segregated and less racist than it used to be. Immigrants from all over the world are integrating very well and making a lot of socioeconomic progress.\n\nWhen you look away from Washington in the heart of our society, we are actually cooperating with each other across ethnic and religious boundaries much more than we used to. None of that should make us complacent, but it should give us confidence that we can build a better society. Without that confidence, the likelihood of failure is going to be much higher.\n\nYou say Americans are cooperating more across these boundaries that we used to. What's your evidence for that?\n\nI start at the most stark level. As recently as three or four decades ago, a majority of Americans thought interracial marriage was immoral, and that it was immoral for Black and White people to have children together. Today that number is down to the single digits because of real psychological changes in our society and the number of interracial newborns has gone up.\n\nEven at the most intimate level, Americans are choosing to intertwine their lives. The same is true when you look at the growth in interracial friendships, the growth in business partners who come from different demographic groups, and the growth of diversity at the top echelon of every American institution.\n\nBut if you look at schools, neighborhoods and even communities of worship in this country, it seems like they're still very much racially segregated.\n\nIf you compare the United States today with 50 years ago, you see a lot more residential integration.  You do see that schools in most parts of the country are much more integrated than they used to be, with the exception of particular neighborhoods of the extremely disadvantaged. But the great majority of the schools are much more diverse than they used to be.\n\nAnd with the rise of megachurches in the suburbs of big American metropolises, you do see a very vibrant form of religion, which is generally multi-ethnic, in a way that rarely existed in American congregations.\n\nIs it possible to have a genuine vibrant, diverse democracy without a deep commitment to racial integration?\n\nHuman beings are deeply groupish. It comes naturally to us to form groups and to favor members of their group over those that don't belong to theirs, especially in a deeply diverse society like the United States. We're never going to change that fact. And that's perfectly fine.\n\nBut precisely because it comes so natural to us to invest particular groups with such importance, we also need to encourage some connective tissue between the different groups in our society. That can take the form of ensuring that people are educated together, that they come to have a deeper, mutual understanding and hopefully a mutual affection.\n\nIt can take the form of patriotism which allows us to have solidarity with each other even if we differ on religion, national origin or skin color. And it also has to include the right for each individual to decide how much importance that they want to give to the group in which they were raised.\n\nIn the book you cite two cities in India that were populated by both Muslims and Hindus. One was devasted by violence between the two groups, and the other wasn't. What was the difference between the two, and what does that story illustrate about building a diverse democracy?\n\nTragically we've seen in India violent riots between Hindus and Muslims, which often kill a lot of people. But when you look more closely, you also see some interesting contrasts. There are two mid-sized cities in India which are about two-thirds Hindu and one-third Muslims. They have similar political histories and yet we see that one city has experienced an extreme amount of so-called inter-communal violence, whereas the other has actually managed to keep the peace.\n\nBoth cities had a rich associational life. They had a lot of  trade unions, literature clubs and all kinds of different places where citizens can meet and debate with each other. But in in one city, Hindus and Muslimas have separate trade unions, and separate book clubs. In the other, many, but not all, have members from both groups.\n\nWhen tensions have run high, that historically made the crucial difference. Because in one city, when rumors spread within each association, there is no link of trust between the communities. And so when Hindus heard some rumors about a young boy being killed by Muslims, they might have been moved to take revenge based on this false rumor.\n\nIn the other city, you have all of these interpersonal links.  You have people to trust each other across the communities. And so, in moments of high political tension when those rumors were flying around, somebody could say, \"Look, this is not true. I've talked to all the people in my community. I know that this didn't happen. Let's just try to find a way to reduce these tensions without unnecessary bloodshed.\" It shows us the importance of bridging social capital.\n\nM any Americans live in their own social media echo chambers. We go back to our own like-minded communities. How do we replicate what happened in that Indian city here?\n\nOver the last decade, millions of Americans have made choices that have made it (the country) more integrated than it was.  We see in particular the rise of suburbs, some upper-middle and some lower middle-class communities, which are more integrated than they were 40 years ago.\n\nThe members of Little Leagues and of neighborhood associations encounter each other ethnic and religious boundaries much more than they had a while ago. There's important work in interfaith space, and by community organizers to try to connect people to each other.\n\nUltimately this will depend on the decision that ultimately all Americans make in their individual lives. Do we stay within the comfort zone that we've grown up in, or do we venture out and make new friendships and build new links with people who come from different communities?\n\nHow much does your personal history shape your interest in this topic?\n\nIt has in two important respects. The first is that I'm Jewish and I grew up in Germany. My family has experienced what it means to be at the wrong end of conflict between groups for three generations. My great-grandparents perished in the Holocaust. My grandparents lost most of their families and were displaced. My own parents, when they were in their late teens and early 20s, were thrown out of a country they grew up in, Poland, because of a state-sponsored, anti-Semitic campaign.\n\nAnd so, I'm intimately aware that a society that could seem relatively peaceful, in which people have gotten along for significant period of time, can suddenly erupt into the most terrifying violence.\n\nWhat would you say to a reader who tells you, 'I'm pessimistic about prospects for a thriving, diverse democracy. Tell me how to make it work.'\n\nWe have no choice but to make it work because a brief glance at history will tell you how terrible the alternative it is - how violent, how unstable, how unjust the future will be if we fail to make diverse democracies work.\n\nWe should recognize that people will always remain members of cultural religious and ethnic groups and that they can help to make up the beauty of our country. But we can also do what we can as individuals, as members of associations, of educational institutions and as citizens to create more connective tissue between American citizens from different walks of life, to make sure that people interact in school, in sports teams, in neighborhood associations and to ensure that we come to a deeper understanding of each other.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Commentary: Why VP choice is crucial for values voters\n\nEditor's Note: Tara Wall, deputy editorial page editor and columnist for The Washington Times, serves as a political contributor to CNN. Before joining the newspaper, she was a senior advisor for the Republican National Committee and was appointed a public affairs director in the Department of Health and Human Services by President Bush. Read her columns here.\n\nTara Wall says the candidates shouldn't forget that values voters are still interested in social issues like abortion.\n\nWashington (CNN) -- The term evangelical voter is often bandied about as a measure of voter attitudes to generally refer to people of faith in Christian denominations. But most often, these religious polls are only referring to white evangelicals.\n\nBlack and Hispanic evangelicals are almost never included in the analysis. That's ironic, because of all the racial and ethnic groups in the United States, black Americans are the most likely to report a religious affiliation, according to Pew Research.\n\nBarack Obama, a man of faith, must know that this is among the reasons the senator has such wide appeal and an overwhelming lead in the black community.\n\nJohn McCain recognizes it too, which is why he's tried hard to address the issue, as he did during last weekend's Saddleback Civic Forum on the Presidency.\n\nHe stated, unprompted, \"When I go into places [like Gee Bend, Alabama] where I know they probably won't vote for me, I know that my job is to tell them that I'll be president of every American.\" It may be considered pandering by some observers, yet it is his way of acknowledging that minority voters of faith matter.\n\nBut among white evangelicals, the script is flipped. McCain leads Obama 68 percent to 24 percent, because despite Obama's born-again credentials, white conservatives are more suspect of his liberal, pro-choice, leanings.\n\nKeeping these factors in mind, it should come as no surprise that we are seeing a push among the presidential candidates to appeal to religious voters. Obama cannot win with the black vote alone and McCain cannot afford to alienate any more of his conservative base. The faithful are politically engaged.\n\nBut defining the faithful or religious is not an easy task. Perhaps the best term to use is values voters. It covers white, black, Hispanic and Asian Americans of varying faiths, who put a premium on values-driven policy. Admittedly, that moniker has come to mean something wholly different than it did in elections past.\n\nIn 2000 and 2004, for example, values voters referred to the increase in evangelical voters who were mostly considered the religious right. Today they have come to represent those who are less affiliated with a political party and vote based on a core set of issues or values (generally conservative), and range in race and age.\n\nNow that the primaries are over there has been a shift by the presumptive nominees, from simply appealing to the party base to catering to the general population. In their quest to appeal to values voters, the two men who-would-be president would do well to consider the implications of their vice presidential picks.\n\nWhile Obama could benefit from a socially opposite vice presidential nominee (such as pro-life Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine), the same cannot be said for John McCain in picking a pro-choice nominee (i.e Tom Ridge).\n\nDespite his \"proud 25-year pro-life record,\" conservatives take issue with McCain's vote to support federal funding of embryonic stem cell research, they've been skeptical since his past comments about people of faith (i.e. Jerry Falwell), and some are growing impatient with the Republican Party's move away from a faith-based platform.\n\nHaving been slightly redeemed by the faithful after his impressive performance at the Saddleback Civic Forum on the Presidency, McCain's pick of a pro-choice candidate would cause a revolt, the likes of which he cannot afford.\n\nFor Obama's part, the candidate seems oblivious to the fact that the majority of Americans are opposed to abortion , and even those who consider themselves pro-choice have a hard time wrapping themselves around the Illinois senator's extreme views and votes against a ban on partial-birth abortions and against the Born Alive Infant Protection Act.\n\nFurther, Obama lost points with his out-of-touch response to the most innocuous question on abortion posed by Pastor Rick Warren, \"When does a baby have human rights,\" to which Obama replied that was above his pay grade. One other trend the Obama campaign may want to consider is that conservative Democrats are making a comeback, winning once-held Republican districts by running on moderate-to-right platforms.\n\nOne thing is certain, while today's values voters are more moderate on fiscal issues and have expanded their top issues to include the environment, the war and economics, they remain staunchly conservative on social issues. Or as Family Research Council President Tony Perkins put it to me: Life is still fundamental.\n\nThe opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.

      "text": "What university tenure battles teach us about the White world of academia\n\nA version of this story appeared in CNN's Race Deconstructed newsletter. To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here .\n\nThe months-long tenure struggle between the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Nikole Hannah-Jones was never about debates over the 1619 Project.\n\nThe fight was about power - about the White conservatives who thought that the Pulitzer Prize-winning Black journalist had gained too much of it.\n\n\"I have studied power my entire life from within institutions where I wielded none. I have written about it. I have reported on it. I have read about it. I have observed it. And, over the years, I have worked myself to accrue it, which is really what angers so many people,\" Hannah-Jones herself noted on Twitter .\n\nShe had barged into the overwhelmingly White world of academia, unsettling it. And for that, she was punished.\n\nUNC eventually granted tenure to Hannah-Jones, who, notably and defiantly, declined the position and opted to join Howard University, a historically Black school.\n\nStill, the episode, like Cornel West's announcement this week that he had resigned from Harvard University , cracked open conversations about how privilege and systemic racism play out in higher education.\n\nHow is racial inequality entrenched in universities and colleges? What did the tenure saga reveal about the experiences of Black students at majority-White institutions like UNC? And with Hannah-Jones relocating to Howard, will HBCUs get the respect they deserve?\n\nTo parse these questions about race in higher education , I spoke with Adam Harris, a staff writer at The Atlantic, where he covers education, and the author of the forthcoming book, \" The State Must Provide: Why America's Colleges Have Always Been Unequal - and How to Set Them Right .\"\n\nThe following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nHow is inequality baked into our higher education system?\n\nEven the foundation of the public higher education system - in particular, as we think of it today - wasn't necessarily built on the idea of broad accessibility for everyone. It was built on the idea of creating places to train White male farmers. There were places to teach men the art of war. There were places to teach men the law. But there weren't places to teach men how to be productive farmers.\n\nWhat grew out of that was the 1862 Morrill Act, which was a way to give states land scrips - often for land taken from Native people - that could be sold to fund schools. These institutions were attended almost solely by White men for the first few decades of their existence and in some instances by White people for more than a century.\n\nFrom that foundation, you have different iterations of bolstering and defending that inequality. The federal government goes through iterations of programs where it's funding institutions that are locking Black folks out and going to court to defend segregation laws.\n\nMeanwhile, the institutions Black students attend are underfunded. However, they're still over-performing. After all, these are the institutions that are creating Black doctors and Black lawyers and building the Black middle class.\n\nThe biggest losers in all this were UNC's Black students, who missed out on the opportunity to have someone of Hannah-Jones' caliber on campus and who may question whether the school really values them. Does this tension reveal anything about the experiences of Black students at predominantly White schools?\n\nOver the past few years, there's been a reconsideration of the relationship between PWIs and Black students. Around 2016 and 2017, you start to see a lot of articles about how Black students are rethinking their places on these campuses.\n\nFrom the integration of colleges to now, there have been several iterations of student protest at PWIs - Black students calling for greater diversity in the student population and greater diversity in the faculty population.\n\nAlso, as campuses have become more diverse, you have more faculty who are in adjunct roles, in conditional roles. So, they're also trying to fight and survive and stick around at these institutions, hoping that they can achieve tenure.\n\nMore and more, Black students might look at a place like Howard or Alabama A&M, where I went, and say, \"My whole self will be appreciated and nourished at this institution.\" I've spoken with several Black students who've said, \"I chose this HBCU. It wasn't my fallback option. I chose this because I wanted a place where I would be supported.\" Black students are thinking about where they want to go - about what place might best serve them in the long run.\n\nAnd of course, after deliberation, these students may decide to go to a school like UNC. But I think that Hannah-Jones' move has reoriented people's mindsets. For a long time, if you hadn't had much association with an HBCU, you might've thought that it was a fallback option, when, really, these institutions aren't any less academically rigorous than PWIs. People actively seek out these institutions. Professors are called to these institutions. And students who go to these institutions thrive afterward.\n\nSo, our higher education system is tremendously flawed. How do we correct years and years of racial discrimination?\n\nOne of the first things is a kind of reconsideration of how states are funding higher education, specifically public higher education. For instance, it's critical to ask, Are institutions that enroll high numbers of Black students receiving significantly less funding? This is the case in lots of states. Typically, as an institution has more Black students, it receives less money.\n\nThat's in part because some of the most selective institutions in most states enroll few Black students. It's the way that the system has historically been set up.\n\nAnd the kind of piecemeal solutions that have been proposed to address this don't necessarily get the job done, particularly because it's such a root problem. Public policy created this problem. Public policy is going to be able to fix it.\n\nI also caution against the idea that philanthropy will solve everything, that the rush of giving to HBCUs over the past year will assuredly continue. In 2020, we saw several of the single largest donations ever to HBCUs, and some of those donations were $5 million. You have to remember that other institutions have been able to benefit from years and years of those sorts of donations, years and years of state funding. You have to ask, What could these colleges have done to build on that money? How much money did they miss out on by not being able to build over time?\n\nOne injection of money doesn't undo decades of segregated and fundamentally inequitable education .\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "What January 6 revealed about the attack on multiracial democracy\n\nA version of this story appeared in CNN's Race Deconstructed newsletter. To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here .\n\nThe noose and gallows.\n\nThe Confederate Army revivalists.\n\nThe White power hand gestures.\n\nIncited by then-President Donald Trump, the January 6 insurrectionists took aim not merely at democracy but also at multiracial democracy. The siege of the US Capitol fits into a history of White backlash , as yet another effort to maintain a strict racial order.\n\nOne year on, as the House select committee probes the attack and as many Republican-led state legislatures enact laws that limit Black Americans' access to the ballot box , it's worthwhile to examine how January 6 lives on in national politics, and explore what that day might reveal about race in the US.\n\nOne way to view January 6 is through the lens of US mythology.\n\nIn the late 1800s, the myth of the Lost Cause grew in popularity. It was an attempt to revise history at least in part by recasting as honorable and valiant the men who went to war in support of the Confederacy - an antidemocratic nation-state whose very existence depended on the bondage of people of African descent .\n\nAn analogous discourse has been underway in the months since January 6, as people on the political right - from lawmakers to shock jocks - seek to portray as the \"true\" Americans those who, at Trump's exhortation, stormed the seat of US government in an effort to overturn Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nRelated article The battle that will define America in 2022 began in 1865\n\nUnsurprisingly, the insurrectionists - more than 700 of whom have been charged by the Department of Justice in connection with the assault - have embraced the fantasy that they're patriots who've been wrongly targeted by the government.\n\n\"It has many of the same trappings (as the Lost Cause),\" Seyward Darby, the author of the 2020 book \" Sisters in Hate: American Women on the Front Lines of White Nationalism ,\" told CNN, referring to January 6. \"There are these notions of: 'We were trying to do the right thing. We were trying to do the noble thing. We were trying to do the American thing. And we were stymied by these forces that want to radically change the shape of the country.'\"\n\nHakeem Jefferson, an assistant professor of political science at Stanford University whose research focuses on the role identity plays in shaping political behavior, echoed some of Darby's sentiments. He stressed that January 6 was a racial reckoning - against the multiracial coalition that installed Biden in the White House, and against the presumed strength of Black voters.\n\n\"When we think about January 6, we can't disconnect it from the claims by Trump and other Republican elites that there was voter fraud in predominantly Black cities,\" Jefferson said. \"January 6 was an attempt by a dwindling White majority to maintain political power - irrespective of the means.\"\n\nIndeed, it'd be a mistake to view January 6 as a singular event, or as separate from the rest of the scheming defining the current political season.\n\nAfter all, Republican lawmakers haven't stopped at lauding the insurrectionists. They've been directing their powers at weakening multiracial democracy, using tools such as aggressive gerrymanders and, maybe most visibly, voting restrictions.\n\nBetween January 1 and December 7, lawmakers in at least 19 states passed 34 laws that make it harder for people to vote, according to a recent tally from New York University Law School's Brennan Center for Justice . Much of this political gamesmanship disproportionately disadvantages voters of color, specifically Black voters.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic lawmakers have failed to pass legislation that might protect access to the franchise.\n\nWhat the country saw on January 6 was \"a battle over the place of White people, and what appears to be a shifting racial hierarchy,\" Jefferson said. \"It's the fear of that change in status that formed the basis of January 6. But it's also formed the basis of the other, less vivid attacks on democracy that come by way of Republican legislatures' attempts to subvert the will of the people.\"\n\nDarby put it in equally blunt terms.\n\n\"January 6 is something that people can hold up as a Lost Cause and talk about from a symbolic standpoint,\" she said. \"But it's also part of a wider war. Thinking about it that way, to me, is really the only way you can get the full picture of where we are and where we're headed.\"\n\nIs it possible to rein in these darker forces - the White rage and resentment that fueled January 6 and that, certainly at present, sustain the Republican Party? It's hard to say.\n\nFor one, in many state elections, the GOP doesn't require the buy-in of multiracial coalitions, so it can hew to the preferences of the most conservative White voters.\n\n\"It's one of the unfortunate pieces of US politics,\" Jefferson explained. \"Because the Republican Party doesn't believe itself to be a party in need of Black support or the support of other racial and ethnic minorities on any serious level, it can organize a political and rhetorical program that's really in line with the interests of ultraconservative, racist voters.\"\n\nJefferson went on, \"My fear not as a partisan but as somebody who cares deeply about this country is that the Republican Party is going to continue, for the foreseeable future, to bank on this kind of politics of resentment and White grievance.\"\n\nEliminating the Senate filibuster, curbing partisan gerrymanders, prohibiting state officials from corrupting the vote-counting process: These are some of the ways to push back against the current crisis. Another: breaking with the two-party system.\n\nThe US's outmoded political structure, dominated by the two major parties, keeps diverse representation and pluralism just beyond reach, and in fact helps clear the way for the GOP to rule by representing only a narrow minority of voters - mostly White conservatives.\n\n\"As long as we maintain our two-party system, and continue the winner-take-all electoral institutions that pose steep barriers to new parties, there is no way out of this doom loop,\" Lee Drutman, a senior fellow in the Political Reform Program at New America, wrote for CNN's Race Deconstructed newsletter last month .\n\nWhat the US needs, Drutman added, \"is transformative electoral reform: proportional representation that will open the door to new parties, and guarantee that an illiberal minority can't gain majority power.\"\n\nAchieving reform of that scope might seem unlikely, given the US's fierce political divisions, but it may well be one of the country's few hopes for charting a path forward.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "What 2021 taught us about the fight for racial justice\n\nBy Brandon Tensley, CNN\n\nPublished Dec. 16, 2021\n\nWe witnessed the destructive power of anger and resentment this year.\n\nBrandishing Confederate iconography, insurrectionists laid siege to the US Capitol, in what amounted to an assault on multiracial democracy . Republican-led state legislatures enacted laws making it more difficult for people of color to vote , and also waged war on transgender kids . Within the GOP, Islamophobia proved to be as potent as ever .\n\nCruelty didnât go unchallenged, of course. For instance, in the aftermath of the massacre in Atlanta that left eight peopleâincluding six women of Asian descentâdead, people across the country poured into the streets to demand change and combat hate . Still, 2021 was marked by a number of prominent issues, particularly on the race and equality front.\n\nTo explore some of these issues, I reached out to experts. They broke down some of the most important 2021 moments and trendsâand reflected on how they might inform race and equality conversations as we trudge into the year ahead.\n\nFor more stories like this, sign up for CNN's Race Deconstructed newsletter.\n\nBy Tomiko Brown-Nagin\n\nIn 2021, I was struckâagainâby the role of images in advancing justice. Among the most potent examples were the videos of the murders of George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery .\n\nImages have long been catalysts of change in the struggle for equal justice under law and civil rights in the US, a focus of my scholarship. Photographs of police violence against peaceful demonstrators in Birmingham âsickenedâ President John F. Kennedy and pricked the conscience of Whites who had ignored the horror of segregation, leading to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. When protesters marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma and were attacked by law enforcement officers, footage of what came to be known as âBloody Sundayâ helped turn the tide in the struggle to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nIn recent years, ordinary people with cell phones have borne witness to racial violence and shared their footage on social media, making injustice more visible. Photos and videos have fostered empathy and proved powerful tools for holding perpetrators of violence to account. Footage of Floydâs murder was shown to the worldâand to the jury that convicted Derek Chauvin. Video of Arberyâs killing appears to have been instrumental in Cobb Countyâs senior assistant district attorneyâs successful prosecution of his killers.\n\nYet images of Black suffering can also normalize it, further devaluing Black lives. Still, the democratization of the means to capture and disseminate images has helped ensure that racial violence cannot flourish in secrecy.\n\nEye-opening images can sometimes help right wrongs, renewing faith that âthese days of challengeâ can help âmake America what it ought to beââthe hope that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. expressed in 1968, on the eve of his assassination in Memphis.\n\nTomiko Brown-Nagin is the dean of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University and the Daniel P.S. Paul Professor of Constitutional Law at Harvard Law School.\n\nBy Angie Maxwell\n\nA disturbingly memorable moment for me in 2021 was watching the parents of elementary school children take their turns berating my familyâs local school board members about so-called âCritical Race Theory,â and hearing their supporters cheer and applaud from the lobby hallway to which they had been relegated for refusing to wear masks.\n\nTheir comments ranged from generic talking points that I recognized as having come from the national conservative organizations manufacturing the anti- CRT outrage to disjointed diatribes against masks, vaccines, globalism and government âco-parenting.â The information deluging these folks may have been fake, but I could see clearly that their emotional reactions to itâmostly rageâwere very, very real.\n\nRacial resentment is a hell of a drug. Add to it a general sense of (faux) entitlement, the hatred that results from decades of âus vs. themâ polarization (including the working mom/stay-at-home mom wars) and a shot of Christian nationalism, and the resulting cocktail is so potent that it renders wild conspiracy theories credible, lost causes winnable and democracies vulnerable.\n\nMaybe most disturbing is that this intoxicating recipe for racial resentment isnât new . Itâs just got a fancy new acronym for its name on the menu, and too many Republican leaders will only continue to serve it to their base in the year ahead.\n\nAngie Maxwell is an associate professor of political science at the University of Arkansas.\n\nBy Theodore R. Johnson\n\nThis year alone, 19 states passed laws making it harder to vote, according to the Brennan Center for Justice . Not only were there changes to mail-in balloting, stricter voter identification requirements and voter purges, but some states began criminalizing certain actions that facilitate othersâ votingâsuch as passing out water to voters waiting in line or helping return ballots for those who require assistance. Many of these new measures disproportionately impact Black and Hispanic communities.\n\nIn the year ahead, voting rights advocates will not only need to continue challenging these restrictive laws in legislatures and courts. They will need to undertake a large and sustained mobilization campaign in communities of color. From the senatorial runoffs in Georgia in January to the 2020 presidential election to the 2017 senatorial special election in Alabama, educating voters about suppression tactics and how to overcome them has demonstrated a political reality: High Black and Hispanic turnout changes election outcomes.\n\nOn the other side of the debate are those who argue that voter fraud is the true threat to democracy. But research has clearly shown that it is exceedingly rare. And there are yet others who suggest that voter suppression is a myth, citing increased turnout among Black voters as evidence that suppression isnât real. What they are actually witnessing, however, is not the absence of restrictive laws, but how education and Black votersâ dogged determination to participate in democracy can weaken the effect of voter suppression.\n\n2021 showed that the desire to suppress the votes of some Americans hasnât gone anywhere . And elections in the year ahead will likely hinge on two primary things: the work of voting rights advocates to educate the public on how to overcome the undemocratic gamesmanship happening across the country, and the unjust demand that communities of color work extra hard to cast a ballot. This is no way to run a democracy.\n\nTheodore R. Johnson is the director of the Fellows Program at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nBy Andra Gillespie\n\nFrom the nature of the killing to the alleged cover-up âthe initial prosecutors declined to prosecute the killers and allegedly buried evidence that suggested that this case warranted investigationâthe Ahmaud Arbery case represented a throwback to the bad old days of Jim Crow. White vigilantes, abetted by the state, were able to terrorize Black people in a demonstration of dominance to maintain a social and racial hierarchy.\n\nBecause this case looked like a throwbackâaugmented by a 911 call from one of the defendants that described â a Black man running down the street â as a crime, a defense lawyer trying to ban Black ministers from the courtroom and another defense attorney suggesting that Arbery could not have been out for a jog because he had â long, dirty toenails ââconvicting Travis and Gregory McMichael and William Bryan was an easy call. Indeed, it was a call that most Americans agreed with . It wonât bring their son back, but I hope that the verdict gives Arberyâs parents a sense of closure.\n\nThe rest of us should not feel closure, though. It was easy to convict three vigilantes who killed a Black man in cold blood. The challenge is combatting the racism that manifests in less obvious, more nuanced cases. Are we ready to examine our standard operating procedures when we find that they routinely disadvantage racial and ethnic minorities? Just last week, CNN reported on a Black couple who used White friends as decoys to prove that appraisers devalued their home by nearly $500,000 . And there is an ongoing debate about how to teach about racism in K-12 schools, reflecting ongoing debates about how much to teach about slavery, discrimination and privilege generally.\n\nSo, while weârepresented by 12 brave jurors in coastal Georgiaâgot the verdict in the Arbery case right, we still have many other things to correct before we can absolve ourselves of Americaâs original sin of racism.\n\nAndra Gillespie is an associate professor of political science at Emory University.\n\nBy Lee Drutman\n\n2021 was a rough year for US democracy. Across the country, Republican state legislatures passed sweeping changes to voting rules, empowering partisan legislatures over independent election administrators and limiting voting methods (like mailed ballots) more likely to help Democrats vote.\n\nNow, with the latest wave of aggressive gerrymanders, and Democratsâ failure to pass comprehensive democracy reform, we are hurtling toward a likely future of minority rule. More specifically, in 2024, Democrats could well win the national popular vote for the presidency, Senate and Houseâand yet Republicans could still win unified control of government.\n\nThis form of minority rule is even worse than it looks. Not only would Republicans rule by representing a narrow minority of votersâmainly White conservativesâbut the party would be ruled by an extreme illiberal faction with definitive minority support.\n\nHow is such minority rule possible in a modern democracy?\n\nItâs because of our antiquated voting system that relies on single-winner, majoritarian elections . This may seem normal to many Americans who have voted under these rules their whole lives. But the consequence of these single-winner elections is that they entrench a two-party system by rendering third parties as spoilers and wasted votes. Layered on top of todayâs deep urban-rural partisan split and deep identity divides, these voting rules drive our toxic hyper-partisan polarization. This system also over-represents the most rural and conservative parts of the country. And in a two-party system, a minority can rule if it is well-placed to be a majority within one of the two major partiesâas the illiberal faction in the GOP now is.\n\nAs long as we maintain our two-party system, and continue the winner-take-all electoral institutions that pose steep barriers to new parties, there is no way out of this doom loop. The only path forward is transformative electoral reform: proportional representation that will open the door to new parties, and guarantee that an illiberal minority canât gain majority power.\n\nLee Drutman is a senior fellow in the Political Reform Program at New America.\n\nBy Deepa Kumar\n\nWhen Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican, called Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, whoâs Muslim and a Democrat, âevilâ and âblackheartedâ and suggested that she was a terrorist , her comments raised nary a peep from the GOP leadership. This revealed the extent to which Islamophobia has become the norm within the party and among its base.\n\nDonald Trump can take credit for normalizing blatant right-wing Islamophobia.\n\nTrump was arguably the most Islamophobic president in US history. He ran on a platform that mixed anti-immigrant, anti-Black and anti-Muslim racism in his attacks on Barack Obama.\n\nTrump and Fox News popularized the birtherism conspiracy theory that claimed that Obama was born in Kenya, could therefore not be president, was not Christian but Muslim, and was loyal not to the US but to Muslim states. These claims werenât true, but they helped grow Trumpâs popularity .\n\nAs he approached his presidential run, Trump explicitly relied on anti-Muslim racism. In one rally in New Hampshire, he pledged to expel all Syrian refugees, stating that they might form a secret army to overthrow the US . Once in power, he instituted a âMuslim banâ that excluded nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries .\n\nTrump shredded the dog whistle tactics his party adopted after the civil rights movement as part of the âSouthern Strategyâ and legitimized blatant right-wing Islamophobia. This had long been the province of the Islamophobic network , an alliance of well-funded groups peddling conspiracy theories about Muslims.\n\nIn 2021, other Republicans continued Trumpâs legacy.\n\nIn addition to the above remarks, Boebert stated that Omar was part of a âjihad squad.â Not to be outdone, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene called Omar âbloodthirstyâ and âbasically an apologist for Islamic terrorists.â The GOP leadership met these comments with deafening silence.\n\nDeepa Kumar is a professor of journalism and media studies at Rutgers University and the author of âIslamophobia and the Politics of Empire: Twenty Years After 9/11.â"

      "text": "Here's why many Black people despise Clarence Thomas. (It's not because he's a conservative.)\n\nFollow:\n\nLong before he became a Supreme Court justice, Clarence Thomas told a story at a public gathering that still sounds shocking years later.\n\nAt the time, Thomas was a relatively unknown conservative who had paid his way to attend a conference of Black conservatives just before Ronald Reagan entered the White House in 1981. At the conference, Thomas told listeners that he opposed public assistance because it had caused his sister and her children to become dependent on welfare payments.\n\n\"She gets mad when the mailman is late with her welfare check,\" Thomas said in a remark that has since been widely quoted . \"That is how dependent she is. What's worse is that now her kids feel entitled to the check, too. They have no motivation for doing better or getting out of that situation.\"\n\nBut a journalist tracked down Thomas' sister and discovered that what he said about her was not quite true. She learned that while Thomas attended law school, his sister Emma Mae Martin worked two minimum-wage jobs before quitting to take care of an ailing elderly aunt. She did receive welfare checks, but their sums were paltry, and she later took another job as a hospital cook. And her children all either worked or were in school when the journalist spoke with her. One even served his country aboard a battleship during Operation Desert Storm.\n\nThomas' story has taken on new meaning since ProPublica and other media outlets revealed he's been the beneficiary of another type of assistance: The lavish lifestyle the justice has enjoyed over the last three decades has been bankrolled in part by wealthy White benefactors.\n\nThomas disclosed last month week that Republican Texas billionaire Harlan Crow paid for private jet trips for him in 2022 to attend a speech in Texas and a separate vacation at Crow's luxurious New York estate.\n\nThomas also acknowledged he had \" inadvertently omitted\" other information in past financial disclosure reports, including a private real estate deal between Crow, Thomas, and Thomas' family. Crow, who paid the private school tuition for a relative of Thomas he said he was raising \"as a son,\" also purchased the home of Thomas' mother in a private real estate deal that allows her to live rent free.\n\nThe disclosures about Thomas have set off a debate among judicial ethics experts. Critics say Crow's largesse is part of a pattern of Thomas taking undisclosed gifts from \"­ fawning \" billionaires who benefit from his legal decisions.\n\nA lawyer for Thomas said there had been \"no willful ethics transgressions\" by the justice, and attributed the criticism to \" political blood sport .\"\n\nBut the latest revelations about Thomas may also have another unintended effect: They should put the to rest the myth about why so many Black people have despised Thomas going back to his days in the Reagan administration, when he chaired the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nThe myth is that many Black people oppose Thomas because they can't handle his stern calls for self-reliance and his admonishments to stop looking for free stuff from White people or government programs. According to the conventional story, Black people don't like Thomas because he is a Republican and a conservative-and because, according to Thomas in a fiery 1998 speech, he refused to be an \"intellectual slave.\"\n\nBut many Black people don't despise Thomas because he's a conservative. They reject him because they say he's a \" hypocrite\" and a \"traitor\" who hurts his own people to help himself.\n\nGeorgia State Senator Nikki Merritt is one of them. The Democrat says recent revelations about Thomas benefitting from wealthy White benefactors validated what she and others have been saying about the justice for years. She was one of several Black members of the Georgia Senate who opposed a bill last year to erect a statue in honor of Thomas.\n\nMerritt says that many Black people don't have a problem with conservatives or Republicans. The late Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice both served in Republican presidential administrations as Black conservatives. Both are well-respected in the Black community.\n\nBut Thomas, she says, is something else. Merritt says he actively hurts his own people by consistently voting to weaken voting rights and helping to overturn Roe v. Wade, a decision she says disproportionately hurts poor women of color.\n\n\"Justice Thomas likes to talk about the myth of pulling himself up by his bootstraps and being resilient, yet he's benefited from handouts from these White conservatives who have supported his privileged lifestyle,\" she says. \"That makes him a traitor and a hypocrite in my eyes.\"\n\nBlack hostility toward Thomas has had a long shelf life, and has spilled out into the public in different ways. The NAACP opposed his 1991 nomination to the Supreme Court. Anita Hill's sexual harassment allegations against Thomas, which came during his confirmation hearings, irreparably damaged his reputation among many Black women.\n\nWhen the National Museum of African American History and Culture opened in Washington in 2016, its organizers excluded any direct mention of Thomas in the exhibits. Various Black leaders have called Thomas an \"Uncle Tom,\" and the NAACP's current president recently called Thomas \"the worst thing\" affirmative action created. It's telling that Juan Williams, the journalist who was once one of Thomas' most vocal defenders in the Black community, now says that Thomas must be sanctioned if the stories are true about how he allowed himself \"to become captive of a far-right legal coterie.\"\n\nOthers, though, see Thomas as an American hero, an embodiment of the idea that anyone can make it in America if they work hard enough.\n\nArmstrong Williams, a Black conservative, said that the recent criticism aimed at Thomas has degenerated into \"hysterical verbal pummeling.\" He said that other Supreme Court judges took subsidized trips in the past, but critics focus on Thomas because of his intellectual independence.\n\n\"Their real grievance against the justice is his courageous unwillingness to shill for the liberal establishment - an insult they find especially offensive because Clarence Thomas is black and contradicts their gospel that all blacks think alike,\" Williams wrote in a recent column .\n\nOne federal judge, a Republican appointee, defended Thomas against charges he was being influenced by wealthy, White donors.\n\n\"Judges are just like every other human being. We have a diverse group of friends, and those friends don't influence the way we do our job,\" Judge Amul Thapar, who sits on a Cincinnati-based appeals court, told CNN in an interview.\n\nThe Supreme Court's press office did not respond to a request seeking comment from Thomas or the high court about the justice's actions or his relationship to the Black community.\n\nBut Thomas has briefly addressed the issue, saying he followed the advice of others who told him he was not required to disclose the gifts.\n\nThe justice noted that the guidelines for reporting personal hospitality were recently changed and added, \"it is, of course, my intent to follow this guidance in the future.\"\n\nThomas' former law clerks also have defended him. Last month more than 100 of them published an open letter saying Thomas' \"integrity is unimpeachable\" and describing him as an embodiment of the American dream as a descendent of enslaved people who worked his way up to the pinnacle of judicial power.\n\nThey declared that Thomas' story \"should be told in every American classroom, at every American kitchen table, in every anthology of American dreams realized.\"\n\nBut critics within the Black community say Thomas doesn't practice what he preaches - and they've been saying this long before recent disclosures about the justice's benefactors.\n\nSome point to his opposition to affirmative action, a set of policies designed to boost minority representation in education and the workplace.\n\nThomas says affirmative action policies are divisive, unconstitutional and harmful to recipients. He recently voted with the high court's conservative majority to gut affirmative action in college admissions, overturning a long-standing precedent.\n\nBut his critics say Thomas would not have made it on the high court without affirmative action. They say he was admitted to Yale Law School because of an affirmative action program and that he was nominated to the Supreme Court to replace Thurgood Marshall , the court's first Black justice, in part because of his race.\n\n\"His entire judicial philosophy is at war with his own biography,\" Michael Fletcher , co-author of \"Supreme Discomfort: The Divided Soul of Clarence Thomas,\". told CNN in 2013. \"He's arguably benefited from affirmative action every step of the way.\"\n\nThomas has admitted that he was accepted at Yale Law School under an affirmative action policy . In his 2007 memoir, \"My Grandfather's Son,\" he wrote: \"As much as it stung to be told that I'd done well in the seminary despite my race, it was far worse to feel that I was now at Yale because of it.\"\n\nThomas' critics have long accused him of hypocrisy in another area: how he talks about self-reliance.\n\nThe contours of Thomas' early life are well-known. He was born in the segregated South and grew up in grinding poverty in rural Georgia. He was rescued by a stern but loving grandfather who taught him the virtues of self-reliance.\n\nThomas flirted with Black nationalism in college, wearing a black beret and memorizing the speeches of Malcolm X, before graduating and gradually becoming a conservative and a Republican.\n\nThomas himself has reinforced this narrative. He often invoked stories of rugged self-reliance in his earliest interviews and in his 2007 memoir , \"My Grandfather's Son.\"\n\nIn 1987, Thomas said he was raised in an environment where \"you had an obligation to help other people, but it didn't come from the government.\" He criticized civil rights leaders who he said were teaching Black kids that getting ahead in America was hopeless because of pervasive racism.\n\n\"They should be telling these kids that freedom carries not only benefits, it carries responsibilities,\" Thomas said. \"You want to be free, you want to leave your parents' house? Then you've got to earn your own living, you've got to pay your own mortgage, pay your own rent, buy your own car, and pay for your own food.\"\n\nBut Thomas' critics point to what they say are contradictions in his biography.\n\nAfter disclosures about the financial help Thomas received from White benefactors went public, his critics pounced.\n\nA headline from The Grio , a Black online magazine, read: \"Clarence Thomas gets gifts from a white billionaire but hates white paternalism.\"\n\nAnother from The Nation, a self-described progressive  magazine, read : \"Clarence Thomas Is What He Wrongly Accuses Black Folks of Being.\"\n\nTori Otten, a writer with The New Republic, highlighted Thomas' criticism of his sister from many years ago, saying his comments were \" particularly hypocritical , considering how often he has claimed to be against government aid and welfare.\" Ott en added, \"But Thomas and his family have spent decades enjoying free travel, housing, and school that are only offered because he holds a powerful position in the government.\"\n\nJuan Williams, a Black journalist who says he and Thomas are friends, also criticized the justice. In a 2022 column before the disclosures about Thomas' gifts, he mentioned Thomas' wife, Virginia \"Ginni\" Thomas, and her support of former President Trump's attempt to reverse the 2020 presidential election results. She emailed lawmakers in Wisconsin and Arizona, asking them to \"fight back against fraud\" by helping overturn the vote.\n\nWilliams didn't use the word \"hypocrisy\" to describe Thomas. He says there are \"contradictions .\"\n\n\"As a young man he was a Black nationalist, able to recite Malcolm X speeches,\" Williams wrote. \"Now, at 74, he surrounds himself with far-right white conservatives and is married to a white woman who sought to help a man viewed b y most Black people as a racist - Trump - overturn a legitimate election.\"\n\nWilliams, like other Black writers, notes that Thomas stands in the tradition of other Black nationalist leaders who preached self-reliance. Some of Thomas' beliefs echo revered Black leaders such as Booker T. Washington, Marcus Garvey and Malcolm X. All preached some variation of self-help and not looking to White people for deliverance from racism.\n\nEven President Obama has delivered speeches that don't sound that different from Thomas. In a 2013 speech to graduates of Morehouse College, a predominantly Black men's college in Atlanta, Obama said that excuses are \"tools of the incompetent.\"\n\n\"We've got no time for excuses - not because the bitter legacies of slavery and segregation have vanished entirely; they have not. Not because racism and discrimination no longer exist; we know those are still out there,\" he said. \"It's just that in today's hyperconnected, hypercompetitive world, with millions of young people from China and India and Brazil - many of whom started with a whole lot less than all of you did... nobody is going to give you anything that you have not earned.\"\n\nYet Williams pinpointed in a recent Atlantic magazine essay what separates Thomas from Black nationalist leaders who preached self-help.\n\n\"Thomas similarly argued that Black people could demonstrate their abilities only if white people got out of their way, and stopped pursuing programs such as affirmative action,\" Williams wrote.\n\n\"However, the big difference between Thomas and most Black nationalists is that he assures whites that they have no responsibility for the history of slavery and continued bias.\"\n\nThomas has consistently ruled against civil rights programs that attempt to address the legacies of slavery and Jim Crow segregation on behalf of Black people. He called such programs \"racial tinkering.\" He also has drawn a moral equivalence between schools that created programs to encourage racial diversity and White schools in the Jim Crow era that banned students of color.\n\nThomas has said that programs designed to make up for racism are demeaning and patronizing to Black people - and unconstitutional, because the Constitution is \"colorblind.\"\n\n\"I do not believe that kneeling is a position of strength,\" Thomas reportedly said in a 1998 speech while talking about affirmative action. \"Nor do I believe that begging is an effective tactic.\"\n\nHe once quoted the 19th century abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who responded to the question of what the American people should do with Black people by saying, \"Do nothing with us!... If the negro cannot stand on his own legs, let him fall also.\"\n\nWhen he worked for the Reagan Administration, Thomas said all civil rights leaders do is \"bitch, bitch, bitch, moan and moan, whine and whine.\"\n\nBut in 1998, Thomas showed a more vulnerable side in an address before the National Bar Association, a predominantly Black group.\n\n\"It pains me more deeply than any of you can imagine - to be perceived by so many members of my race as doing them harm,\" he told the group. \"All the sacrifice, all the long hours of preparation were to help, not to hurt.\"\n\nThomas' speech was greeted with scattered boos and little applause, news reports said.\n\nThe recent disclosures about Thomas' bankrolled lifestyle have been greeted by some Black people in another way-by nodded heads and a string of \"I told you-so's.\"\n\nMerritt, the Georgia state senator, says calling Thomas a traitor and a hypocrite is fitting criticism because of the impact of his judicial decisions.\n\n\"He claims he's a Black man that cares about Black people and Black causes, but every action that he has taken has done nothing but harm Black people,\" she says.\n\nSo maybe now the myth about why Black people oppose Thomas will finally die.\n\nFor many Black people, the speech that Thomas gave about his sister was not an aberration but the start of a pattern: Thomas projects onto Black people what he refuses to see in himself. As one critic said:\n\nThomas, not his sister, is the \"true welfare queen.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Race and Reality in America: Five key findings\n\nCNN/KFF poll examines issues relating to race, ethnicity in America\n\nAmericans more likely to consider racism a big problem today than they were 20 years ago, poll shows\n\nLarge numbers of blacks, Hispanics say they have faced discrimination in past 30 days\n\nFew issues have as fraught a history as race in America. The country's recent history on race includes highs such as the election of the country's first black president and heartbreaking lows such as the shooting deaths of nine people at a black church, allegedly by a white supremacist aiming to start a race war.\n\nCNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation partnered to survey Americans on issues relating to race and ethnicity. The poll explores how things have changed in the last 20 years and what race means now. The survey also examines how different groups of Americans experience race day-to-day, and what they think about racism and the racial divisions that are so pervasive in our economic and political lives.\n\n5 key findings About the poll Full results (PDF)\n\nHere are five key findings from the CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation survey on race and reality.\n\nOverall, 49% of Americans in the poll say racism is a big problem in the country, up from 28% four years ago. It's also more than the 41% who said so 20 years ago, shortly after the Million Man March on the nation's capital.\n\nIn the new poll, the percent of people who see racism as a big problem is higher among racial and ethnic minorities than it is among whites - 66% of blacks and 64% of Hispanics call it a big problem, compared to 43% of whites.\n\nWomen, particularly white and Hispanic women, are more apt to consider racism a problem than are men. And among whites, there's a broad political divide, with 56% of white Democrats calling it a big problem compared with 32% of white Republicans.\n\nBut the age gaps that one might expect from an America whose demographics are shifting generationally do not materialize. Younger whites are about as likely as older whites to consider racism a big problem, and younger people of color are just as likely as their older peers to say it's a big problem.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of Americans say racial tensions have increased in America in the last 10 years, much higher than the 29% who said so in 2001 and the 47% who felt that way in 1995. On this issue, there is agreement across racial and ethnic groups, with majorities of whites (67%), blacks (65%) and Hispanics (55%) all feeling tensions have grown in the last decade.\n\nThat view is shared among young and old, male and female, Democrat and Republican, urban, suburban and rural. About the only statistically meaningful difference is that white conservatives are most likely to say tensions have grown (75%) in the last 10 years.\n\nAt home, when socializing, and at work, white Americans report their lives are mostly spent around others of the same race. About seven in 10 whites say they live (69%) or socialize with (68%) people who are mostly of the same race as them, and six in 10 employed whites have co-workers who are mostly other white people (60%). Hispanics and blacks are more apt to report more diverse neighborhoods, social circles and workplaces.\n\nNon-Hispanic whites make up a majority of the American public, so that gap isn't entirely a surprise. But what's most notable about these results is that there's no significant difference between younger whites (18-45) and older whites (45-64) who say they socialize with, work with or live around people who are all/mostly the same race as them. Senior whites, however, are a different story. Those 65 and older are more likely than their younger counterparts to say they live near or socialize with those of the same race.\n\nYounger blacks and Hispanics, however, are far more likely to say they have diverse social circles and neighborhoods.\n\nOverall, about three-quarters of Americans say they think African-Americans (77%) or Hispanic-Americans (74%) face at least some discrimination in society today.\n\nPoll: 49% say racism a 'big problem' 4 ways we can show hidden biases How Americans feel about racism 'I still believe in the American dream' Why blacks believe more than whites What discrimination looks like today Love in the face of racism Who will you blame once Obama's gone? Poll: 1 in 5 blacks report 'unfair' dealings with police in last month The steep cost of incarceration on women of color\n\nPoll: 49% say racism a 'big problem' 4 ways we can show hidden biases How Americans feel about racism 'I still believe in the American dream' Why blacks believe more than whites What discrimination looks like today Love in the face of racism Who will you blame once Obama's gone? Poll: 1 in 5 blacks report 'unfair' dealings with police in last month The steep cost of incarceration on women of color\n\nThe poll results provide a measure of just how many people have faced what they consider to be unfair treatment on account of their race or ethnicity in everyday situations - at work, while shopping, at restaurants or the movies, while seeking health care or in dealings with police.\n\nFifty-three percent of blacks report experiencing one of those types of unfair treatment in the last 30 days, as did 36% of Hispanics. Among whites, 15% say they've dealt with such unfair treatment.\n\nMore blacks say they experienced unfair treatment while shopping than in any of the five scenarios tested - 33% reported an occasion like that. And blacks were least likely to report unfair treatment when seeking health care (12%). About a quarter of blacks say they experienced unfair treatment at work or in a restaurant, bar, theater or other entertainment venue.\n\nIn dealing with police specifically, approximately one in five African-Americans and one in six Hispanics say they've faced unfair treatment in the last 30 days, compared with 3% - or one in 30 - among whites.\n\nA majority of African-Americans say they or a close friend or family member have been incarcerated (55%), significantly higher than the share among whites (36%) or Hispanics (39%).\n\nFor whites, the share saying they have been incarcerated themselves or have a close relationship with someone who has drops with education. Thirty percent of whites with college degrees say they, a family member or close friend have been incarcerated, compared with 40% among whites who do not have college degrees. For African-Americans and Hispanics, the numbers are similar across educational lines.\n\nThe percentage of blacks who say they or someone they know have been incarcerated is particularly high among those who live in urban areas (60% vs. 48% among those who live in the suburbs or rural areas) and among younger African-Americans (62% among those age 18-34, 55% among those age 35-64 compared with 35% among black seniors).\n\nThe CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation poll was conducted August 25-October 3, 2015, among a random national sample of 1,951 adults, including 501 black and 500 Hispanic respondents. Results for all groups have been adjusted to reflect their actual national distribution. Interviews were conducted on conventional telephones and cell phones, in English and Spanish, by SSRS of Media, Pennsylvania. This poll was jointly developed and analyzed by CNN and staff at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points; for results based on African-Americans or Hispanics it is plus or minus 6 percentage points.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "What the reactions to Clarence Thomas post-Roe reveal about white liberals\n\nFollow think\n\nMORE FROM NBC\n\n© 2025 NBCNEWS.COM\n\nThere were six Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe v. Wade last week. The majority opinion was authored by Justice Samuel Alito. However, in the aftermath of the ruling, there has been an intense and particular focus on a different justice: Clarence Thomas.\n\nSoon after the court handed down its decision, some pro-choice advocates began hurling outrageous and overtly racist remarks in Thomas' direction (including liberal evocations of the \"N-word\" on Twitter) - often to the acclaim of some other left-aligned whites.\n\nThomas' embrace of the Republican Party is consonant with a deep mistrust of white liberals, the institutions they control and the policies they try to advance in the name of \"social justice.\"\n\nThe remarks were so ubiquitous that \"Uncle Clarence\" began trending on Twitter, a reference to the eponymous character of Harriet Beecher Stowe's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" who has emerged as a symbol of Black men who are too subservient to whites.\n\nIn practice, the term is primarily deployed against Black people who strike positions that elite liberals find distasteful. For instance, \"Uncle Tim\" previously trended on Twitter after Black Republican Sen. Tim Scott's rebuttal of President Joe Biden's inaugural address to a joint session of Congress.\n\nThen again, in other cases, minorities who violate the preferences and sensibilities of liberals are literally declared to be white instead. At least insofar as Thomas and Scott are branded as race-traitors, critics still recognize their race.\n\nHowever, there is a deep irony in characterizing Thomas as an \"Uncle Tom\" (or worse) given that, prior to pursuing public service, he identified with Black nationalism . He is currently married to a white woman and has aligned with the GOP. However, as political theorist Corey Robin has shown in his book \" The Enigma of Clarence Thomas ,\" his views on race and racial issues have remained highly consistent over the course of his life.\n\nIndeed, Thomas' embrace of the Republican Party is consonant with a deep mistrust of white liberals, the institutions they control and the policies they try to advance in the name of \"social justice.\"\n\nThis mistrust was widely shared among Black activists of his generation - and is in keeping with Thomas' Supreme Court decisions, including overturning Roe. If anything, the racialized attacks many liberals directed at Thomas in the wake of the Dobbs v. Jackson ruling confirm the pessimistic view of race relations that prevailed among many of the Black thinkers who shaped Thomas' worldview and is exhibited by Thomas himself.\n\nFor instance, Thomas was deeply inspired by Malcolm X. He had a poster of Malcolm X that hung in his dorm room . He memorized many of his speeches by heart, and he continues to evoke him frequently to this day.\n\nIt was Malcolm X, of course, who famously declared that, \"In this deceitful American game of power politics, the Negros (i.e. the race problem, the integration and civil rights issues) are nothing but tools, used by one group of whites called Liberals against another group of whites called Conservatives, either to get into power or to remain in power.\"\n\nHe argued that white liberals and white conservatives differ \"only in one way: the liberal is more deceitful than the conservative. The liberal is more hypocritical than the conservative. Both want power, but the white liberal is the one who has perfected the art of posing as the Negro's friend and benefactor.\" He continued, \"By winning the friendship, allegiance and support of the Negro, the white liberal is able to use the Negro as a pawn or a tool.\"\n\nA 2019 New Yorker profile reported that Thomas also supported Black Panther leader Kathleen Cleaver and Communist Party member Angela Davis, both of whom had been wanted by police.\n\n\"When he was asked at his confirmation hearings what he majored in, Thomas said, 'English literature.' When he was asked what he minored in, he said, 'protest,'\" the article notes, pointing out that his first visit to Washington was to march against the Vietnam War and the last rally he went to demanded the release of two Black Panthers. \"I was never a liberal,\" the article quotes him as saying at a talk in 1996. \"I was a radical.\"\n\nThomas seems to have been put on this path by the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. King had advanced a particularly optimistic view of white liberals and cross-racial advocacy. However, in the months leading up to his death, even he was forced to concede that \"Negros have proceeded from a premise that equality means what it says, and they have taken white America at their word when they talked of it as an objective.\"\n\nIn contrast, he wrote, most whites \"proceed from a premise that equality is a loose expression for improvement. White America is not even psychologically organized to close the gap - essentially, it seeks only to make it less painful and less obvious but in most respects to retain it. Most abrasions between Negros and white liberals arise from this fact.\"\n\nThe political theorist Robin notes that, in the aftermath of King's assassination, which occurred when he was a student at Holy Cross in Worcester, \"by his own report, Thomas has a realization that nobody is going to do anything for black people. And by nobody, he means white liberals and white leftists.\"\n\nBy the time Thomas arrived at Yale Law School , he was militant on racial matters and more-or-less fully disillusioned with mainstream liberalism. Hillary Clinton, who overlapped with him in the early '70s, recently declared that as long as she has known Thomas, he's always been filled with \"grievance,\" \"anger\" and \"resentment.\" Unsaid, but critical context: These were feelings Thomas displayed toward white liberals in particular (like Clinton herself), who dominated Yale at the time, and who continue to dominate elite spaces today.\n\nThomas noted in a recent interview that people regularly assume he has difficulties around other Black people by virtue of his politics. \"It's just the opposite,\" he declared. \"The only people with whom I've had difficulties are white, liberal elites who consider themselves the anointed and us the benighted ... I have never had issues with members of my race.\"\n\nIn fact, there have been many prominent Black intellectuals and leaders whose Black nationalist-inflected mistrust of white liberals ultimately led them to conservativism . For Thomas, it was the work of Black economist Thomas Sowell that ultimately helped him channel his misgivings toward \"white saviors\" into a coherent, right-aligned political philosophy.\n\nThere is a deep irony in characterizing Thomas as an \"Uncle Tom\" (or worse) given that, prior to pursuing public service, he identified with Black nationalism.\n\nHowever, Black nationalist impulses continue to influence his rulings and judicial philosophy. For instance, core to Thomas' thinking , per Robin, is \"a belief in Black self-defense.\" This commitment undergirds Thomas' staunch support for the Second Amendment. It also plays a role in his opposition to abortion.\n\nThomas has expressed repeatedly that his aversion to abortion is significantly informed by its deep and longstanding ties to racial eugenics programs. It should be noted that these eugenics initiatives were pushed heavily by white liberals of the time, also in the name of helping the marginalized and disadvantaged. Thomas has no trust in similar social justice rhetoric being deployed by abortion rights advocates today.\n\nInstead, the reactions many contemporary liberals have directed toward Thomas for diverging from their preferred policies on abortion - including an unabashed embrace of racial epithets and slurs, in the name of social justice advocacy no less! - seem to be a clear vindication of Black nationalists' longstanding suspicion that, at bottom, many self-described \"allies\" are themselves deeply racist and simply use the Black cause as a convenient vehicle for shoring up their own power and influence.\n\nAs cultural critic Yasmin Nair put it in a tweet on Saturday, \"Clarence Thomas is not your 'I can be a racist' card, people.\" This is something that should never even have to be said to those ostensibly committed to social justice. The fact that it apparently must be said is telling.\n\nRelated:\n\nMusa al-Gharbi is a Paul F. Lazarsfeld fellow in sociology at Columbia University.

We need to talk about it.\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nAcross the country, conservative propaganda is helping sell the Republican Party's claim that it's pro-parents .\n\nPolicies that would bar educators from teaching American history accurately or prohibit lessons on gender and sexual orientation are just some of the goals conservatives claim are a boon to parents.\n\nBut these GOP policies and a host of others are obviously anti-children, and I often wonder why they're not more widely condemned in media for their inevitable harm to America's kids.\n\nIn that way, this majorly white group is dodging condemnation Black parents often receive in the media : claims that they're unfit parents.\n\nThat needs to change. It's white conservatives who have a parenting problem.\n\nFor example, the GOP-led Florida Legislature passed a bill last week that would outlaw schools from teaching kids up to third grade about gender identity and sexual orientation. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he will sign the bill, which he claimed will ensure his kids aren't \"sexualized.\" Conservatives throughout the country are pushing similar laws.\n\nBut the purpose of those lessons isn't to \"sexualize\" children. These lesson plans teach kids about the existence of gender as an identifier and encourage tolerance regardless of one's gender or the people to whom they're attracted. Conservatives have children - yes, LGBTQ children, too - who deserve to know the real world includes people of various genders who are worthy of respect and love. Denying that fact doesn't make it any less true, but it does ensure many kids will grow up as paranoid and deluded about these topics as the people passing these laws.\n\nMississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, was in a similar situation Monday. Reeves signed a bill he said targeted critical race theory, the college-level field of study conservatives cite to fear-monger about school lessons on racism. Critical race theory is not usually taught in K-12 public schools.\n\nReeves claimed such lessons \"humiliate and indoctrinate\" kids. The bill he signed bars schools from teaching \"any sex, race, ethnicity, religion or national origin is inherently superior or inferior.\"\n\nOf course, one can safely assume lesson plans about racial inequality aren't claiming that any race is inherently inferior or superior. They teach racial tolerance while addressing the history of white supremacy in America.\n\nDenying this is harmful, too. Kids - white, conservative ones included - would benefit from learning about our increasingly diverse country and the ways it has historically benefited some groups at the expense of others. Ignoring this won't stop the justifiable demands for racial equality; it will just ensure many kids grow up mystified, confused and angered about them.\n\nConservative neglect for children doesn't end in the classroom. Conservative lawmakers' obsession with fossil fuels is actively worsening the environment American children will one day be forced to live in. And their opposition to social welfare policies like the child tax credit have dragged millions of children into poverty, as I've written in the past .\n\nThe conservative movement has had ample opportunity to show it cares about kids. It's time we all acknowledge its repeated failures on that front.\n\nMSNBC opinion blogger\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois for participating in the House Jan. 6 committee 's investigation into the Capitol riot.\n\nWith that resolution, which defined the probe as a \"Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse,\" the Republican Party officially endorsed the insurrectionist mob. It made clear the GOP's support for the violent rioters over some of its own party members.\n\nDespite their attempted revisionism, it's important to remember the type of people the RNC is classifying as \"ordinary citizens\" and the behavior the party is classifying as welcomed political speech.\n\nSome rioters who breached the Capitol hurled racist epithets while chasing police officers. Other attackers waved flags, signs and symbols of white supremacist groups . Others literally brought a gallows and shouted \"Hang Mike Pence!\" And all of them were engaged in a plot to overthrow the 2020 election, focused in part on baseless allegations of voter fraud in predominantly Black districts.\n\nThis was unmistakably a lynch mob. And it's important we see Republican efforts to defend it for what they are: attempts to normalize racist violence as a political strategy. Their stance harks back to the early 1920s, when a resurgent Ku Klux Klan tried to assert its legitimacy by claiming to represent many Americans' political interests. They, too, sought to establish their brutal tactics as a form of acceptable political speech.\n\nYou can read the RNC resolution and hear echoes of Hiram Wesley Evans, the head of the Klan in the 1920s and '30s. In his 1926 essay \"The Klan's Fight for Americanism,\" Evans said the group spoke for \"the great mass of Americans of the old pioneer stock,\" which didn't include \"intellectually mongrelized liberals.\"\n\nThe Klan does \"fairly and faithfully represent them,\" Evans wrote of the \"old pioneer stock\" of Americans. \"And our proof lies in their support.\"\n\nEvans went on to write of \"low-standard aliens\" whose influence he claimed hindered American freedom.\n\n\"Those who know the American character know that if the problem is not soon solved by wisdom, it will be solved by one of those cataclysmic outbursts which have so often disgraced - and saved! -the race,\" he wrote.\n\nAll that is old is made new again. Just as white conservatives accepted racist violence as a political tactic in the past, white conservatives today - those with actual power, at least - are suggesting violence is a fundamental part of political discourse.\n\nRelated posts:\n\nGosar whines over Jan. 6 committee subpoenaing his white nationalist buddy\n\nKyrsten Sinema raked in hefy GOP donations while opposing Biden's agenda\n\nSarah Palin is out for blood with long shot NYT defamation lawsuit\n\nHead over to The ReidOut Blog for more.\n\nMSNBC opinion blogger\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

But he's beating a crowded field of politicians at their own game, emerging as an unlikely Republican front-runner in California's coming recall election.\n\nPolls show a dead heat among likely voters over whether to remove Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom from office on Sept. 14. And Elder, who probably could never win in liberal California under normal circumstances, is far ahead of the 45 other replacement candidates, even though only about a quarter of the electorate supports him.\n\n\"I used to go on Fox News a lot,\" said businessman John Cox, who was the last GOP nominee against Newsom but is now struggling for attention, even though he campaigns with a giant bear. \"They haven't had me on very much lately, because they're supporting Larry.\"\n\nElder, much like Donald Trump in the 2016 GOP presidential primaries, has become the black hole at the center of the recall campaign, sucking in more established politicians and mainstream Republicans, whether they like it or not.\n\n\"Elder is blocking out the sun in the way Trump did,\" said Tim Miller, a former GOP strategist who worked on Jeb Bush's ill-fated presidential campaign and now lives in California.\n\nTwo other candidates, former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner, have called on Elder to drop out of the race over comments he has made about women and allegations of domestic abuse, which he has denied.\n\n\"Larry Elder does not have the character, the judgment, the skill set or the experience to be governor,\" Faulconer said Wednesday at a debate that Elder skipped.\n\nSome Republican activists have complained that Elder has skipped debates and hasn't shown up at local events, campaigning instead mainly on the TV and radio shows of fellow conservative talkers.\n\nThe man who started the effort to remove Newsom from office isn't a fan. \"He's hoping to skate into office based on his celebrity status alone,\" said the recall's lead proponent, Orrin Heatlie.\n\nNewsom's campaign, which since Day One has tried to portray the recall as a Trumpian takeover of California, has piled on, trying to jolt awake complacent Democratic voters and force independents who might be inclined to support a moderate like Faulconer to pick a side.\n\n\"Some say he's the most Trump of the candidates,\" Newsom told supporters at a campaign event this month. \"I say he's even more extreme than Trump.\"\n\nBut the attacks only seem to boost Elder further, at least among the conservative base, and offer him plenty of free airtime, too.\n\nA Change Research survey released Thursday showed Newsom favored to survive the recall and Elder far ahead of the replacement field at 27 percent. He was followed by \"will leave the question blank\" at 22 percent and \"not sure\" at 15 percent. Cox, Faulconer and Jenner each had less than 5 percent support.\n\nHe has gotten several endorsements.\n\nChuck Norris said Elder \"has the proven grit\" to be governor. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said he's the only one who can \"save California from floating all the way to the People's Republic of Communist China.\" Candace Owens, the young Black provocateur, calls Elder one of her \" idols .\" And former Trump speechwriter Stephen Miller, whose career Elder helped start, called him \"the one true guide I've always had.\"\n\nCox said: \"Faulconer is getting attention by crapping on another candidate, who then responds, which just generates more attention. That's what you media guys love to write about, no offense.\"\n\nAs a Black conservative, Elder would say he spent his life behind enemy lines, from his childhood home ruled by an abusive father to his time at uber-liberal Brown University, in the courtroom as a lawyer and then, for almost 30 years, on talk radio.\n\nIn his early years on the radio in 1990s Los Angeles, with the Rodney King riots and police brutality scandals swirling, he faced a Black-led boycott . African American callers regularly dial in to call him an \" Uncle Tom ,\" tell him he's \" not a brother \" or wonder whether he had blood transfusion from a white man.\n\nTo Elder, it's all evidence that \"blacks are more racist than whites\" and that \"white condescension is more damaging than white racism,\" as he wrote in his 2001 book, \"The Ten Things You Can't Say in America.\"\n\nRuben Navarrette, a California-based columnist, met Elder in those early days, when they hosted late-night radio programs from studios across the hall from each other.\n\nOver coffee during commercial breaks or at late-night breakfasts after their shows wrapped with Elder and Navarrette's co-host at the time, Tavis Smiley, Elder would talk about how he was driven by a desire to share the message of self-reliance he learned from his father with Black audiences.\n\nBut, Navarrette said, as Elder's star grew, he increasingly spoke to white conservatives, who are thrilled to hear a Black man tell them things like absentee fathers are to blame for crime, systematic racism is a \"lie\" and the minimum wage should be $0.\n\n\"There's the Larry Elder who talks to Black people. That's one message,\" Navarrette said. \"Then there's the Larry Elder who talks to white people. That's a different message.\"\n\nUnlike Trump, Elder, who graduated from the University of Michigan Law School and practiced with a major firm before striking out into politics, spills out reams of facts and figures as he debates and seems to thrill in the intellectual challenge of pushing buttons.\n\n\"The good news is he is a great communicator,\" Navarrette said. \"The bad news is in the process of communicating, he sometimes forgets he's no longer hosting a radio show.\"\n\nElder's up-by-the-bootstraps life story is the foundation of his iconoclastic worldview.\n\nIn Elder's telling, his violent-when-not-absent father is a hero, not a villain. His tough-love lessons of hard work informed Elder's views about race and the welfare state.\n\n\"I hated my father - really, really hated him,\" Elder wrote in his 2012 book, \"Dear Father, Dear Son: Two Lives,\" and they didn't speak for almost 10 years.\n\nBut after law school, when Elder went to confront his father late one night at the cafe he ran, they talked for eight hours, and Elder's anger melted away.\n\nHe learned about his father's \"hard-a-- life\" growing up in the Jim Crow South, where Abraham Lincoln's Republican Party was the defender of Black rights against the white supremacist Democrats, and he left grateful for all the hard work his father had put in to give him a better life.\n\nElder enjoyed that better life thoroughly, relishing in the lifestyle his fame afforded while frequently using his radio program to disparage women and people of color who he said blamed others for their struggles.\n\nHe met his ex-fiancée, Alexandra Datig, at the Playboy Mansion. Datig had worked for Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss before she turned state's evidence against her.\n\nDatig, a conservative activist in Los Angeles who is supporting Faulconer, recently filed a police report alleging that Elder in 2015 brandished a gun while he was high on marijuana during an argument while they were dating. Elder hasn't been charged with any crimes.\n\n\"I have never brandished a gun at anyone,\" Elder said in a statement. \"I grew up in South Central; I know exactly how destructive this type of behavior is. It's not me, and everyone who knows me knows it's not me. These are salacious allegations.\"\n\nAs with Trump, Elder's supporters are willing to take a gamble and look past accusations.\n\n\"Youre looking for that one shining star who can carry the message. Although we had some honorable people [already running], they just weren't resonating with the voter for whatever reason,\" said Teresa Hernandez, the president of the Lincoln Club of Orange County, an influential conservative donor group that was an early backer of Elder.\n\nMany in her circle had been hoping former Trump adviser and Twitter troll Rick Grinnell would run; when he opted out, she polled her followers on Facebook for other names, and Elder's was the overwhelming favorite.\n\n\"I saw my Facebook people just went crazy over him,\" she said. \"Everybody has heard his message. A very consistent message. That's the problem with so many politicians. They stick their fingers in their air and see what's popular.\"\n\nComparing California to a terminally ill patient wanting to try an experimental drug, she acknowledged that Elder, who has never held public office, is a gamble.\n\n\"Larry Elder may hit it out of the park or colossally fail. We don't know, but we've got the right to try,\" she said.\n\nAlex Seitz-Wald is a senior political reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Justin Trudeau's blackface shows that being progressive doesn't exempt you from racism\n\nFollow think\n\nMORE FROM NBC\n\n© 2025 NBCNEWS.COM\n\nLast month, policy analyst Samuel Sinyangwe noted that America has more governors who've worn blackface than black governors , a statistic that PolitiFact then confirmed. This is why no one should be surprised that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau donned brownface as a teacher attending a private school gala in 2001 and wore blackface at least twice before that.\n\nWhen images from the party first emerged, fans and even critics who respected Trudeau were shocked that this beloved politician could do something so offensive. For many years, Trudeau has been hailed as a young , vibrant world leader who would affect social change beyond Canada. He championed gender equality , his policies welcomed immigrants and refugees , and he wasn't afraid to speak out against President Donald Trump's racist rhetoric .\n\nAbsolutely none of this means Trudeau himself can't be racist.\n\nWhite liberalism will likely shape the narrative in Trudeau's favor using these tried-and-true excuses: the passage of time, his young age and feigned ignorance.\n\nContrary to popular belief, progressivism doesn't exempt one from being racist. Arguably, white liberal racism is worse than conservative racism. If you ask people of color, you're likely to hear that we'd rather have people stand by their racism publicly as opposed to trying to convince us that they're colorblind while being racist privately.\n\nThe difference between white liberals and white conservatives is that when conservatives are racist, they are upfront, honest and unapologetic about it. Politicians like Trump and Iowa Rep. Steve King will say explicitly positive things about white nationalism and white supremacy . Alternatively, white liberal racism is covert, casual and harder to detect.\n\nI've worked in politics and been privy to white liberal racism. I first experienced it when I was a teenager working on a local political campaign when an elected official mocked African American Vernacular English. Months later, I called him out on his racism. He laughed and said he wasn't racist; after all, he employed a majority black and female staff in one of the wealthiest black areas in the country . In his eyes, he could never be racist based on that fact alone.\n\nAs the Trudeau controversy unfolds in the mainstream media, expect to see an unsettling but relentless defense of Trudeau. In the coming days, white liberalism will likely shape the narrative in Trudeau's favor using these tried-and-true excuses: the passage of time, his young age and feigned ignorance.\n\nYou will probably see cable news pundits repeat these standard talking points: He did this 18 years ago. What's the big deal? He was 29 years old, and he's not the same person at 47. How is it racist? It was just a costume. It doesn't show what's in his heart. He didn't know any better, but now he does. It was a different time back then. Look at the context. There are bigger forms of racism to focus on, and this is a distraction!\n\nBut it's wrong to say this issue is a distraction, because past racist acts may be reflective of how Trudeau views race. If he could do something so racist multiple times , how can we know he doesn't still hold racist beliefs? This may be a window into how Trudeau approaches policymaking. The prime minister's agenda continues to harm Canada's indigenous population: His Kinder Morgan decision showed that he values the interests of big oil companies over the health and well-being of Native Canadians.\n\nWhat's even more disturbing is Trudeau's apology, in which he expressed ignorance. He claimed he didn't know it was racist . But in 2001, I doubt that many people didn't know that it was. Indeed, dressing up this way - which conjures the dehumanizing minstrel shows of decades past - is much more than a costume; it recalls a painful history that has been ignored for too long.\n\nWhite people can do explicitly racist things and still believe they're not racist in part from conditioning that teaches racism is synonymous with white hoods, burning crosses and lynchings but often little more, and for people of color to think otherwise is a misunderstanding or overreaction.\n\nThat we tend to live in segregated communities exacerbates the problem. Blackface is an element of white culture that goes unseen when neighborhoods are racially separated. When you rarely interact with people of color, you don't have to be nearly as cautious about being called out about racism. The golden rule is: If you wouldn't do or say something if a black person was within earshot or near you, it's probably racist. That's how to know that someone is aware an act is racist and doesn't care enough not to do it.\n\nThis also creates a culture of privilege where these transgressions are rarely punished adequately. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, was caught wearing blackface , and he's still in office. After Paula Deen's N-word controversy , her restaurant was flooded with white supporters . Justin Bieber is still selling out concerts and producing hit records despite his own N-word controversy .\n\nYet there are tens of thousands of people of color sitting in prisons for nonviolent crimes they committed 18 years ago. If you're black, you must be held accountable for your actions regardless of your age or how many years ago it was; for white progressives such as Trudeau, age and time are a defense for misbehavior.\n\nTrudeau could have said that he knew what he did was wrong but did it anyway because he was cloaked in white privilege; that up until this point, that privilege insulated him from facing consequences for these types of actions; that what he did was racist, and he was going to use this time to challenge himself to be better. Such honesty would have been appreciated by people of color. And it could challenge other white liberals to make it their mission not to prove that they're not racist, but to see how they actually are. That would be progress. Denial is not.\n\nOla Ojewumi is a Washington, D.C.-based writer, activist and founder of the education nonprofit Project ASCEND.

      "text": "Martin Luther King Jr. reminds us that the GOP has never been the only party for the faithful\n\nFollow think\n\nMORE FROM NBC\n\n© 2025 NBCNEWS.COM\n\nSince President Ronald Reagan reluctantly signed the Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday into law in 1983, it has become American custom to celebrate Dr. King as a moral leader in our nation's history.\n\nBut until recently, talking about morality in America's public square has been an activity all but limited to Republicans. The Trump presidency has irrevocably changed that - for the better.\n\nFor instance, on the first day of this 116th Congress, civil rights activist and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., joined colleagues in the new Democratic majority to introduce House Bill 1, a 571-page omnibus package designed to expand and protect voting rights. Recalling that he and others spilled their blood on the Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama to advocate for the expansion of voting rights, Lewis said , \"I truly believe deep in my heart, in my soul, the way votes were not counted and purged in Georgia and Florida and other states changed the outcome of the last election. That must never happen again in our country.\"\n\nBefore Lewis could finish his statement, fellow Democrats had joined in with shouts of \"Amen,\" like a congregation in the prophetic black church tradition that Lewis calls his spiritual home.\n\nDemocrats concluded that presentation of their legislative priorities with a call-and-response appeal to the public faith of the civil rights era - all a direct appeal to morality on opening day.\n\nThe language of faith and morality has often been noticeably absent on the left since the 1980s, when the religious right cemented its political dominance under Reagan and the Catholic Church began publicly condemning and then threatening with excommunication openly Catholic Democrats who supported reproductive rights.\n\nThat is partly because, after the New Right of the late 1970s formed a \"pro-family\" coalition to organize cultural conservatives around opposition to reproductive rights post-Roe v. Wade and the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, white Southerners who had previously resisted the civil rights movement found new language to articulate their opposition to the policy agenda of Lewis and others on the left. The Moral Majority's \"culture wars\" offered those white conservatives, then alienated from the Democratic party, a way to feel righteous about resistance to a progressive political agenda: Cultural conservatives weren't defending white values, but \"family values.\"\n\nIn the imagination of most Americans - conservative and liberal - the GOP then became \"God's Own Party.\"\n\nThere were, of course, hold-outs: The historically black Baptist, AME and AME Zion churches , the National Council of Churches and progressive evangelical organizations like Sojourners continued to point out in public life that Jesus and the biblical prophets consistently advocated for the poor, the immigrants and the children. For many non-white religious voters, their experiences of cultural marginalization allowed them to vote for Democrats (who mostly opposed that marginalization) while faithfully attending their houses of worship; the culture wars, they understood, were not for them. But in the media and public debates, cultural conservatives increasingly became the public voice of \"morality.\"\n\nThus, for much of the past four decades, the \"Amen\" corner in Congress has been solidly on the Republican side of the aisle.\n\nBut, as Francis FitzGerald noted in her 2017 book \" The Evangelicals: The Struggle to Shape America ,\" the religious right's narrow appeal to family values was less persuasive to many millennials who attended multicultural public schools and understood wealth inequality and global warming as issues directly impacting them and their children. A realignment of faith in public life has been underway for a generation, allowing for progressive politicians and advocates to re-embrace using the language of morality to characterize their policy positions.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for instance, has made a point of saying that she and other Democrats reject President Trump's demand for a wall on the Southern border because it is an immoral appeal to xenophobia and white nationalism. And, in their advocacy for economic measures that would expand opportunity to poor and marginalized communities and protect the environment, Sens. Corey Booker, D-N.J., Kamala Harris, D-Calif., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have consistently presented economic opportunity and equal protection under the law as part of America's moral obligation.\n\nBut the tipping point against Republicans as the arbiters of morality may well be the full-throated endorsement of a blatantly immoral and dishonest president by traditional religious right spokesmen like Franklin Graham, Jerry Falwell, Jr. and James Dobson. (Falwell, for his part, recently told the Washington Post that there's nothing Donald Trump could do to lose the support of evangelicals.) While the previous generation was trained to equate morality with cultural conservatism through a political lens, evangelicals have diversified along with the rest of America over the past generation.\n\nPlus, while white evangelicals were never a majority of the people of faith in America, the moral bankruptcy of the Trump administration has exposed their disproportionate influence on faith in public life. Democrats, it seems, are taking this opportunity to reclaim the high ground in American public life.\n\nOf course, enacting a moral agenda in America will require more than resistance to voter suppression, an immoral wall and corporate influence in Washington. If morality is to be at the heart of the \"more perfect union\" toward which our religious and constitutional traditions point us, then it does not and cannot belong to either party or to any individual. Political morality is and must rather be an aspiration informed by all of our faith traditions.\n\nStill, if Democrats have decided that the language of morality belongs to them, too, I celebrate that as a sign that we may be moving toward a more honest public conversation about how our deepest values as a diverse people can contribute to the good of the whole. To that, I say, \"Amen!\"\n\nJonathan Wilson-Hartgrove is a preacher and spiritual writer in Durham, North Carolina, and assistant director at the Yale Center for Public Theology and Public Policy.

      "text": "From Diamond and Silk to Kanye West: Why Republican efforts to convert black voters are failing\n\nFollow think\n\nMORE FROM NBC\n\n© 2025 NBCNEWS.COM\n\nTrump Republicans are in the market for African American supporters. Some would even say desperately so. How else to explain the new Diamond and Silk movie \"Dummycrats,\" which had its one-day theatrical release last week?\n\nFar from Oscar fodder , or even the MTV awards, the film is part of a broader, recent trend in which mostly white conservatives have sought out and elevated a series of black surrogates, hoping that these surrogates' often unintelligible, anti-liberal rantings will siphon black voters away from the Democratic Party. With midterm elections margins expected to be razor thin , this effort has taken on a renewed sense of urgency.\n\nKanye West is arguably the most high-profile of these new ambassadors. West, who has taken to sporting a MAGA hat, capped off his September 29 performance on \"Saturday Night Live\" with a long-winded, pro-Trump monologue claiming he was being bullied for supporting the president. West doubled down with an even more meandering speech during his October 11 visit to the Oval Office .\n\nUnlike his wife, Kim Kardashian West, who visited the White House in May and successfully persuaded Trump to commute the sentence of 63-year-old grandmother Alice Johnson , a nonviolent drug offender who spent 21 years in prison, Kanye's brand of advocacy has accomplished very little. Though he was to address the president about violence in Chicago and other important topics, West instead dissolved into a rant that seemed to take even Trump by surprise.\n\nWest's antics haven't phased the overwhelmingly white Trump supporters who champion him, though, and he even has a few black defenders. Writing for The Daily Caller, the conservative site founded by Tucker Carlson and Neil Patel in 2010, contributor Nick Fitzgerald, who is white, wrote an article based on West called \"The Left's New Plantation - Intellectual Slavery.\"\n\n\"What has West done to merit such vitriol?\" asked Fitzgerald. \"The answer is frightening and simple: He is thinking for himself. He's wearing a MAGA hat. And he has influence.\" Of course, it's highly doubtful Fitzgerald would've been so quick to defend West had the rapper used that same \"influence\" to claim Trump \"doesn't care about black people\" - as he did during a telethon for Hurricane Katrina victims in 2005.\n\nThe GOP's insistence that they are not just a party of rich, white people has led them to latch on to any black supporter they can get.\n\nIn short, the GOP's insistence that they are not just a party of rich, white people has led them to latch on to any black supporters they can get. This dynamic seems even more obvious when you consider their strange embrace of Diamond and Silk.\n\nDiamond and Silk rose to GOP stardom as Trump surrogates during his successful 2016 presidential bid. The plainspoken sisters Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, North Carolina natives, have been welcomed on several Fox News shows, including \"Hannity, \"The Ingraham Angle\" and \"Fox & Friends.\" In April, they even testified before Congress about Facebook allegedly blocking and censoring their page, prompting Rep. Darrell Issa, R-CA, to come to their defense.\n\nThe pair's mainstream support is surprising, but not because their talking points often feel divorced from reality. Just a few years ago, the conservative establishment would have surely shunned the duo based on their flamboyant dress and hairstyles alone. Republicans barely took one-time Republican Party leader Michael Steele seriously.\n\nClearly, this lack of polish or thoughtfulness doesn't bother the GOP, however; Diamond and Silk have been accepted into the fold because of their race and their willingness to publicly and profusely support Donald Trump when very few other black people will. As black women, the Democrats' most loyal base , Diamond and Silk are arguably even more critical to the image Republican leaders are desperately trying to cultivate. This is perhaps why Diamond and Silk have been specifically praised for their aggression towards prominent Trump critic Rep. Maxine Waters.\n\nThat support undoubtedly is also why Diamond and Silk now have their own movie, \"Dummycrats.\" The full-length film was theatrically released for one night only on October 15, but can now be screened on Vimeo.\n\nWaters and fellow Democrat Rep. Nancy Pelosi are the film's biggest targets. While mostly unnoticed by the mainstream press, \"Dummycrats\" did get a few positive reviews in more conservative corners of the web. Writing for the conservative site Newsmax, Michael Clark claimed the film would \"wake-up undecided voters.\" Clark applauds the film's lighter tone and lists what he sees as its best moments - moments that of course \"expose\" prominent Democrats.\n\nCandace Owens is another woman who has used her personal story to rise among the conservative ranks. (Owens has Kanye West to thank for some of her prominence; the rapper brought her along during his infamous TMZ appearance when he proclaimed slavery a choice. ) According to Buzzfeed, the Connecticut native was anti-Trump as recently as 2015, but now she too seems to be cashing in on her Trumpian enlightenment. Officially, she works as the Director of Communications for Turning Point USA, a conservative advocacy group. But Owens, who got her start sharing pro-Trump speeches on YouTube and social media, may have a future on the small screen. Van Jones even told NBC News that she could be the next Megyn Kelly.\n\nOwens (and Kanye West and Diamond and Silk) are right about one thing, however: With President Barack Obama no longer in office, the cracks in the Democrats' African American voting block are showing. Stephen Thrasher, a black, gay writer who says he typically votes Democrat, shared this discontent with The Guardian last year. Referencing an article by Republican political strategist Patrick Ruffini , Thrasher notes that Democratic support has slipped among black voters. \"Other than not being as crudely racist, xenophobic and misogynist as the Republican party, the contemporary Democratic party offers little to African Americans,\" Thrasher wrote.\n\nOne of the main reasons for this disillusionment is the Obama administration's inability to make a significant dent in structural racism over its eight years in office.\n\nOne of the main reasons for this disillusionment is the Obama administration's inability to make a significant dent in structural racism over its eight years in office. Worse, there's the perception that the Democratic Party hasn't really taken African American needs and concerns into consideration, a party leaders have largely taken the black vote for granted. Current Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez admitted as much at an Atlanta fundraiser for Stacey Abrams, who could become the nation's first ever black female governor if she wins in Georgia. \"African Americans - our most loyal constituency - we all too frequently took for granted,\" Perez said.\n\nAnd yet, by relying so heavily on stereotypes and gimmicks for outreach, the GOP is blowing its opportunity to win over black supporters. They truly make it hard for sensible people to take them seriously, whether acting officially or in a rogue capacity. Take this Arkansas radio ad attempting to rally black support for Republican Congressman French Hill. The ad argued that the treatment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh proved that if elected, \"white Democrats will be lynching black folk again.\" The ad, which Hill has since disavowed , was funded by dubious organization Black Americans for the President's Agenda, a South Carolina-based, Trump-supporting PAC. The PAC is co-founded by Vernon Robinson , who is black, but largely funded by wealthy white people, according to Slate.\n\nThis is a real radio ad currently running in Arkansas in support of Republican Congressman French Hill on radio stations targeted to the African American community.  I don't even have words to describe it. pic.twitter.com/vpzt1nGPlc\n\nBut if the GOP does adopt a more practical strategy, not even Kanye West's star power is bright enough to obscure an essential truth: The Trump administration, and Republicans in the last several election cycles, have not been good for black people.\n\nA recent report released by Prosperity Now, a D.C.-based nonprofit dedicated to expanding economic opportunity for low-income households and communities, and the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP), also D.C.-based, shows that Trump tax cuts have disproportionately helped white people . White households received $218 billion of the $275 billion tax cuts, or 80 percent. More than 40 percent of the beneficiaries of Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are white households in the top five percent of earners, according to the report.\n\nPlus with Stacey Abrams and Andrew Gillum running competitive races for historic wins as governor of Georgia and Florida respectively, the Democrats are winning back young black voters. Proving you have something to offer is a winning strategy, it seems. Calling liberals - including millions of black voters - \"Dummycrats\" is probably not.\n\nAtlanta-based writer Ronda Racha Penrice is the author of \"Black American History For Dummies.\"\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

They've made tremendous gains at the state level under President Obama, hold a near-unbreakable majority in the House, and now control the Senate as well.\n\nBut they've come up short by a significant margin in the last two presidential elections, where turnout is higher and the electorate is more diverse, and have plenty going against them in the next one.\n\nPresidential elections are unpredictable and it often appears that one party can't lose - until it does. Democrats bounced back from three demoralizing blowout losses to win in 1992 against an incumbent, President George H.W. Bush, who seemed unbeatable earlier in his presidency. Republicans could do the same in 2016.\n\nSo what does the GOP have to do to finally crack the White House? These are some broad theories on how they win:\n\nCut Into the Democratic Base\n\nThe guiding principle behind a number of Republican candidates is that the party can only win when it reverses its losing margins with Democratic-leaning groups. That means winning converts among the most important planks of President Obama's winning coalition - young voters, minorities, and single women.\n\nTwo of the GOP candidates most prominently aligned with this \"big tent\" approach are Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush both of whom, not coincidentally, are from the very diverse swing state of Florida. The rest of the \"establishment\" side of the GOP field, including Ohio Governor John Kasich, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and Senator Lindsey Graham fit into this camp as well.\n\nIn particular, candidates in this category see winning over Latino voters as a critical step towards victory. Just 27 percent went for Romney in 2012 and \"big tent\" proponents, most prominently Rubio's pollster Whit Ayres, believe that share needs to get to 40 percent or higher to win the White House.\n\nRubio, whose parents are Cuban immigrants and who regularly speaks to the press in Spanish, sought to address the issue by co-authoring an immigration reform bill that would put undocumented immigrants on a path to citizenship, but walked it back after a conservative revolt.\n\nBush, who also speaks fluent Spanish and is married to a Mexican immigrant, is a longtime immigration reform supporter, but draws the line at legal status rather than citizenship. A leaked presentation the Bush campaign gave to donors this week noted that he was the most popular Republican with Latino voters in a Quinnipiac survey of general election match-ups.\n\nThe Latino vote isn't the only area where GOP candidate see growth potential. Rubio is especially focused on peeling young voters from Democrats, who won 60 percent of the under-30 set in 2012. On any given day you'll hear him talk about his student loan debt, his favorite rap song, and even that he listens to EDM (popular among young voters). Rand Paul, whose father Ron Paul was popular with college students, has aggressively tried to pull in young voters by talking about issues like high-tech surveillance. He's also made a strong pitch to black voters by emphasizing racial disparities in the justice system.\n\nSupercharge the GOP Base\n\nThe most prominent alternative to the \"big tent\" theory, which assumes that the GOP's core voting bloc is too small to win on its own, is the \"boost the base\" theory.\n\nRepublicans have kept competitive with Democrats by hitting higher and higher margins with white voters - Romney's 59 percent was an improvement on George W. Bush's 58 percent in 2004, but not enough to overcome Obama's margins with non-white voters.\n\nIt's possible, \"boost the base\" proponents argue, that Romney's number wasn't a ceiling but the start of a trend and that Republican candidates should focus on increasing turnout and margins with conservative voting groups higher and higher - even if it means antagonizing the Obama coalition further. Pushing the GOP share of the white vote a couple of percentage points higher might be enough to win, especially if Clinton can't replicate Obama's incredible turnout operation.\n\nCandidates like Ted Cruz, who has talked about boosting turnout among born-again Christians , fit into this theory as do others like Bobby Jindal and Mike Huckabee whose positions and rhetoric are overwhelmingly aimed at firing up social conservatives. Donald Trump, who is loathed by Latino voters and loved by working-class white conservatives, belongs into this category to some degree as well. So did Scott Walker before he dropped out.\n\nThe framework is especially popular in conservative circles because it doesn't require painful concessions on divisive issues within the party. Many conservatives in this camp believe Latino voters are unlikely to ever join the GOP in large numbers, so the party should oppose any kind of immigration reform that might depress turnout among the base.\n\nThere's a geographic divide between the \"big tent\" and \"boost the base\" on the electoral map as well. Winning more Latino voters is more likely to put states like Florida and Colorado back into the red. Raising margins with white voters is more likely to put rust belt states like Ohio, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin into play.\n\nThe line between the two camps isn't perfect. Dr. Ben Carson, for example, might fit into the \"big tent\" camp in a unique way. His supporters boast that Carson's deep roots in the African American community will enable him to win by beating Romney's dismal performance with black voters (six percent voted Republican in 2012). On the other hand, his message and platform is overwhelmingly tailored to hardcore conservatives, which fits the \"boost the base\" theory. Every candidate will likely try to achieve some combination of better base performance and better margins with weaker groups, even if their emphasis is different.\n\nOr None of the Above\n\nThe dirty secret of elections is that candidates can run a perfect campaign with a prefect strategy, but the results are frequently determined by events outside their control. In the end, the best chance Republicans might have at winning is simply getting lucky.\n\nOne possibility is that Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders emerges weakened from the primaries - perhaps Clinton's email woes worsen or Sanders proves too extreme for general election voters. Early polls have little predictive value, but already some surveys have shown Clinton trailing Republican candidates in hypothetical match-ups - even outsiders like Trump and Carson. Some political science models, like Emory professor Alan Abramowitz's \"Time for Change\" formula , assume that any party trying for a third term in the White House faces significant built-in challenges.\n\nAnother possibility is that some external event derails the Democratic nominee. Perhaps the Federal Reserve raises interest rates too quickly and an unexpected economic slowdown drags Democrats down. A foreign policy disaster could spark a backlash against President Obama, whose approval ratings should have a major impact on whether Democrats hold the White House.\n\nThe Democratic nominee may start with certain advantages, but they're not nearly powerful enough to counter a toxic national environment. Take 2008, where the financial crisis and President George W. Bush's deep unpopularity helped Obama win an otherwise red state like Indiana and sent Democrats to Congress in GOP-leaning districts they had no business winning.\n\nSo Democrats - don't get cocky. Republicans - don't despair. There's still a strong possibility that Republicans wake up on November 9th with one of their own headed to the White House.\n\nBenjy Sarlin is policy editor for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Bush is at odds with the NAACP and has not spoken to the civil rights group since his 2000 campaign.\n\nBush and education Paige took aim at two NAACP leaders, chairman Julian Bond and president Kweisi Mfume, for what he called \"hateful and untruthful rhetoric about Republicans and President Bush.\" At the convention, NAACP officials have described some black organizations as mouthpieces of white conservatives and have said Bush's education law disproportionately hurts minorities.\n\nThe No Child Left Behind law of 2001, Paige said, is dedicated to closing the learning gap between blacks and whites and giving school choice to poor and minority students.

But it deadlocked on the two most serious charges.\n\nUltimately, the defendants have been ordered to pay the nine plaintiffs - all from Charlottesville - an amount in excess of several million dollars for their participation in the deadly event. However, the jury was unable to reach a consensus on two federal charges that accused the defendants of conspiring to commit racially motivated violence and having knowledge of such a conspiracy and failing to prevent it.\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs hinged their hopes for those two federal charges on the Ku Klux Klan Act, a law first created in 1871 to protect emancipated Black people from racist attacks. The plaintiffs said they'd seek a retrial on those charges. The Unite the Right rally was coordinated in response to the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a park in Charlottesville, and several of the white nationalists and white nationalist organizations in attendance shouted racist and antisemitic rhetoric as they marched.\n\nStill, Tuesday's ruling is a costly rebuke to white nationalist groups and their allies, perhaps discouraging some of them from stoking violent attacks in the future. The roughly two dozen defendants include \"crying Nazi\" Christopher Cantwell , the prominent white nationalists Richard Spencer and Jason Kessler, and James Alex Fields Jr., who was convicted of killing counterprotester Heather Heyer at the 2017 rally . Cantwell, Spencer and Kessler were all ordered to pay several hundred thousand dollars to the plaintiffs while Fields was found liable for several million dollars.\n\nMultiple white nationalists groups have been ordered to pay $1 million each, including Vanguard America, the National Socialist Movement, Identity Evropa and the Traditionalist Worker Party.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this verdict will deter other white nationalists from acting on their dangerous fantasies amid the current uptick in violent political rhetoric plaguing the country.\n\nRelated posts:\n\nKyle Rittenhouse trial was designed to protect white conservatives who kill\n\nEx-cop's deathbed confession could reveal who was really behind Malcolm X murder\n\nIt's past time for Biden to explain why he's supporting this cruel, anti-science policy\n\nHead over to The ReidOut Blog for more.\n\nMSNBC opinion blogger\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Republicans are running their most diverse slate of candidates ever. Will voters follow?\n\nDave is a Political Reporter for Semafor, joining us from the Washington Post. to get his coverage of the national political scene in your inbox twice a week.\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nWESLACO, Tex. â In 11 days, Republicans are on track to elect more Black, Hispanic, and Asian members of Congress than they ever have before.\n\nThree of them, dubbed the âtriple threatâ by GOP strategists, are running in the Rio Grande Valley, where Democrats have lost ground after a century of easy wins. And theyâre campaigning as MAGA conservatives, portraying the party most Latinos still vote for as âopen borderâ elitists who view patriotic Americans with contempt.\n\nâThe Democrat Party, they donât see us as Americans,â Rep. Mayra Flores told a crowd here at the Mid Valley Assembly, a church less than nine miles from the U.S.-Mexico border, at a conservative summit last weekend. âI think it took Mayra Flores to become a member for them to be for deportation. Itâs like, go back to Mexico, go back to Mexico!â\n\nFlores, who won a June special election that national Democrats opted not to spend in, is one of 19 non-white Republicans in the House. That number will double if the party wins and holds the seats marked competitive by the Cook Political Report, and could go higher if more of the partyâs 67 non-white candidates can pull upsets.\n\nAnd that diversification has happened without the compromises that Republicans once thought theyâd have to make to broaden their appeal â a shift left on immigration to win more Latino and Asian votes, or an embrace of criminal justice reform to attract more Black votes. Theyâve run as fiscal and cultural conservatives, jabbing at âwokeâ progressives, and embracing the Trump-era border policies that Democrats expected to wreck Republican outreach to non-white voters.\n\nâWe donât need 87,000 more IRS agents,â said Cassy Garcia, who worked for the Trump administration and Sen. Ted Cruz before challenging Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar this year, at the Saturday forum. âWhat we need are 87,000 more border patrol agents.â\n\nDemocrats saw their problems in south Texas coming two years ago, when Donald Trump ran far ahead of his 2016 numbers in the region and first-time candidate Monica De La Cruz nearly defeated Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez.\n\nâOur support for strong border security is one of the major reasons why Hispanic Americans are joining our movement by the millions and millions and millions,â Trump said at a Saturday rally in South Texas, just two hours from the candidate forum.\n\nThe new, Republican-drawn map made the 15th district, which stretches from San Antonio in the north to McAllen in the south, substantially more winnable for De La Cruz. National Democrats have abandoned this yearâs nominee, Michelle Vallejo, while Gonzelez is facing Flores in the neighboring district where both of them live.\n\nâThere are always going to be Latinos who vote Republican because of various issues,â said Yvonne Gutierrez, the managing director of the Latino Victory Project, which has continued to invest in the De La Cruz/Vallejo race. âBut that is not the predominant sentiment.â\n\nStill, in Texas, and in other competitive parts of the country where Republicans nominated non-white candidates, Democrats hoped that the GOP gains were flukes â and that conservative nominees would struggle to flip swing seats.\n\nIn Michigan, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent six figures to help John Gibbs, a Black Trump administration veteran, push past Rep. Peter Meijer, a white Republican whoâd voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6 riot. In Connecticut, Democrats portrayed George Logan, a black state senator, as an anti-abortion extremist. In Texas, Gonzales has gone after Flores for sharing conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.\n\nIn 2020, President Biden carried all of those districts. All three are competitive now, and polls have found Republicans holding onto gains with non-white voters that they made in 2020. Dan Sanchez, the Democrat who lost the June special election, said that his party had made a strategic error by ignoring his race, allowing Flores to build name recognition and a campaign war chest when it could have stopped her by turning out the base.\n\nâShe was appealing to the Hispanic, uneducated voter because she was from Mexico, and she was the quote-unquote âAmerican dream,ââ said Sanchez. âForget about the fact that her ideals go against a lot of the needs and benefits of the Latino population down here.â\n\nRepublicans see it differently. With economic angst showing up among voters of all races, they believe national Democrats are stumbling in ways that help non-white candidates in particular.\n\nFlores, Garcia, and De La Cruz have mocked progressive groups for using the academic term âLatinx,â rarely used by Latinos themselves; theyâve reminded voters how Jill Biden called South Texas Latinos âas unique as the breakfast tacosâ in San Antonio, a clunker in a prepared speech that the First Lady quickly apologized for.\n\nSouth Texas Democrats havenât made those mistakes, and have separated themselves from the national party on a few issues â on abortion, and on the U.S.-Mexico border, criticizing the Biden administrationâs changes to what Trump left behind. Largely in agreement on the policy, Garcia and Flores make the issue personal. Both are married to border patrol agents, and both say theyâd go after the progressives whoâve demeaned them.\n\nIn a short interview, Flores said that she would vote to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and that she wanted to keep a Trump-era order, repeatedly denounced by progressives, that expels asylum-seekers. The Democratic candidates agree on the second part.\n\nâI knew something like this was coming,â Cueller said in an interview. âWeâre seeing exactly what Iâd said was going to happen, where they were going to try to paint Democrats as being weak on border security.â\n\nJoey Cepeda, who owned a home alarm business, said that he hadnât bothered voting at all until he backed Trump in 2016. Heâd been selling more alarm systems to locals who worried about âillegalsâ crossing onto their property, and while heâd heard Democrats denounce the Trump agenda as racist, he didnât take it seriously.\n\nâTheyâre using that card too much,â said Cepeda, 42. âEspecially when theyâre the party of the KKK.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nFor a long time, Republicans thought they had to choose one of two options : Restrict legal immigration, which produced what Rush Limbaugh called âautomatic Democrat voters,â or appeal to non-white voters, whoâd be turned off by a hardline immigration position. It is clearer than ever that Republicans donât have to choose, and some of the candidates who excite the party the most are non-white conservatives who can argue against liberal race and immigration policy while laughing at accusations that theyâre âracist.â\n\nDemocratic strategist Simon Rosenberg has been on a mission to debunk the idea that Republicans are gaining ground with Latino voters in the Trump era. On a call with reporters last week, he went race by race across the southwest to argue that Democrats continued to put up strong margins among non-white voters, which helps explain their resilience in places like Arizona and Colorado. âThis is an amazing success story for the Democratic Party,â he said, âand we should be celebrating it far more than we have.â\n\nConservatives in the U.K. are currently led by an extremely diverse slate of politicians, headlined by new Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and are generating similar agita on the left over their positions on economic and social issues. There are also some messaging parallels between Margaret Thatcher-era conservatives and Republican candidates in America today. A famous 1983 campaign poster in the U.K. featured a Black man with the caption: âLabour says heâs Black. Tories say heâs British.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Americana\n\nTHE SCENE\n\nLAS VEGAS â In a Planet Hollywood hotel ballroom, a few steps away from the Criss Angel Theater, around 200 Republican Party activists worked on their battle plans. The Republican National Committee would not save them. They would save themselves.\n\nâNo more culture of losing,â Turning Point USA CEO and co-founder Charlie Kirk told an audience of RNC members, GOP county chairs, and plugged-in activists. âEmbrace Donald Trump. Donât fight Donald Trump. Embrace what heâs brought to the party. Itâs a populist, people-centered movement, and this is what the oligarchs fear the most.â\n\nThe two-day Restoring National Confidence summit was built to tweak Ronna McDanielâs party committee, whose 168 members were about to meet in another hotel on the strip. Both meetings unfolded as the RNC released its weakest yearly fundraising numbers of McDanielâs tenure.\n\nTPUSA, with annual revenue not far off the RNCâs, had been building an alternative power base for years. It advocated non-stop ârelationalâ organizing, developing an app that its allies could use to find votes. It had identified low-propensity voters â âdisengaged voters,â as Arizona RNC member Tyler Bowyer called them â and put their information in binders for conference attendees. And it had built an influential media network, including Kirkâs show, which revels in the weekly churn of cultural battles that obsess the young, online right.\n\nOne host last week had expounded at length on the potential âpsyopâ of the Kansas City Chiefs making it to the Super Bowl and Taylor Swift endorsing Joe Biden â a topic that came up several times on stage in Las Vegas. Democrats, explained Bowyer and pundit Jack Posobiec, would use Swiftâs fame to engage those lower-propensity, low-information voters.\n\nThe same week, Kirk had caused his own uproar by lashing out about diversity efforts at airlines â âIâm sorry, if I see a Black pilot, Iâm going to be like boy I hope heâs qualified,â he said on his show â and posting at length about the criminal records of the Central Park Five , after one of them, the recently elected New York City Council Member Youssef Salem, was pulled over by police. Earlier in the month, heâd commemorated Martin Luther King Jr. Day by remarking upon the civil rights leaderâs âawfulâ personal life. The comments drove shocked media coverage â and, according to Kirk, getting no blowback âoutside of one donor.â\n\nDAVIDâS VIEW\n\nKirkâs group started as an effort to supercharge conservative outreach to young people. But the Vegas conference was a reminder of how vastly its kingmaking ambitions within the Republican party have grown. The fact that Kirk and Turning Pointâs stable of podcasters have become some of the MAGA movementâs premier podcasting shock jocks has, if anything, appeared to help that effort, building its credibility among the GOP base at a moment the RNC is shedding its own.\n\nOne year ago, Kirk and the more rebellious RNC members took a run at McDaniel and lost. The chair won a fourth term with 111 votes, to 54 for California RNC member Harmeet Dhillon and four for MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell. McDaniel, at the time, chided Kirk and Dhillon for âtrying to take over the RNC,â shortly after the GOP in Arizona â where Kirk lived, and where TPUSA had implemented its strategies to shape the party â had lost key races .\n\nDhillon is now representing Trump in his challenge to states that have cited the 14th Amendmentâs insurrection clause to block him from the ballot; Lindell was at Kirkâs summit, talking the crowd through his challenges to the 2020 election. TPUSA had remained resolutely pro-Trump as the RNC tried to run a neutral primary, and that was why it could be trusted, according to the luminaries on stage.\n\nâThe forces of the world are against him, including all the money and all the power in the Republican Party,â Steve Bannon told the crowd on Tuesday. âThatâs what the RNC has. Theyâve been harnessing the donor money to stop Trump. They should not get another penny.â\n\nAround two dozen RNC members stopped by the alternative summit, sitting in the front row for strategy sessions, chatting in the hallways about why theyâd given up on party leadership.\n\nâI would love for Ronna McDaniel to let us know that sheâs stepping down,â said Fanchon Blythe, an RNC committeewoman from Nebraska. âThe RNC is a bunch of fluff.â\n\nSome talk in the hallways speculated on when McDaniel might go and who should replace her. In training sessions, the question was bigger: How could Republican activists build a permanent infrastructure, one that always beat the left?\n\nKristina Karamo, the ousted MAGA chair of the Michigan GOP, met allies who wanted to help reverse her purge. Bannon hosted hours of his War Room podcast, passing the microphone to local party leaders who felt let down by HQ. Donald Trump Jr. thanked Kirk and the audience for being âthe tip of the spear,â fighting where too many people had conceded.\n\nâPeople want to know, what are we gonna do to save our country?â Karamo told Semafor. âWe canât let the internal conflict become the dominating factor â and then that becomes what we focus on instead of saving the country.â\n\nPlenty of Republicans see Karamoâs politics â and TPUSAâs â as the source of that conflict. She won her chairmanship after running and losing a 2022 race for secretary of state, which she never conceded ; sheâd won that nomination after working as a 2020 poll watcher and appearing across conservative media as an on-the-ground expert on the fraud she saw. She was ousted after complaints about the partyâs shrinking events and flatlining fundraising, with her opponents picking ex-Rep. Pete Hoekstra to replace her.\n\nThe problem for the official party apparatus, though, is that it canât reach the most disgruntled MAGA voters, who tend to view the world a lot like Karamo. TPUSA thinks it can. Even Hoekstra made a brief stop at their conference on his way to the RNC meeting.\n\nâType in âWisconsin conservatives.â A lot of election integrity groups exist on Telegram,â Turning Point Action enterprise director Brett Galaszewski said at one training session. âThese are prime crowds for recruiting.â\n\nOne of the newest RNC officials at the conference was Gina Swoboda, the new chair of the Arizona Republican Party, who won that role after Senate candidate Kari Lake released an audio recording of former chair Jeff DeWit telling her that âvery powerful peopleâ might offer her money to quit. DeWit, whoâd once called TPUSA âmore powerful than the RNC,â had handed his job to a Trump campaign alum whoâd spent years publishing voter rolls to find evidence of fraud\n\nâIâm wearing the armor of God,â Swoboda told Bannon during one of his conference livestreams. âI think that the reason that God made me my nerdy election self is for this time.â\n\nTHE VIEW FROM A SKEPTIC\n\nMarc McMain, the party chair of Walton County, Georgia, said that heâd come to the conference to learn best practices. He found some, but wasnât swayed by the talk about challenging the 2020 election. He confronted Jack Posobiec when he suggested that Gov. Brian Kemp, by not finding a way to reverse Trumpâs Georgia defeat, bore responsibility for the deaths of soldiers. And he was unmoved by presentations alleging 2020 election fraud by mathematician Doug Frank and Mike Lindell.\n\nâGod bless him, but thatâs not my wheelhouse,â McMain said. âI think there was nefarious activity in the election, but, you know, I just want to win the next race. I canât stand that faction of our party that wants to shoot within the tent.â\n\nROOM FOR DISAGREEMENT\n\nMcDanielâs RNC kept the press out of its winter meeting, but pushed back on the TPUSA storyline of a well-fed party elite that never did anything. The RNC tallied up 73 trainings across the country in 2023, with more 2,100 attendees; that included four trainings in D.C. that county chairs were invited to attend. The party said it offered help, to any GOP official who wanted it, on basically everything â handling press, turning out the vote, and advertising online. And if TPUSA was going to keep training poll watchers and contacting voters, the party had no problem.\n\nNOTABLE\n\nMinnesota . House Majority Whip Tom Emmer led calls for Rep. Ilhan Omar to resign, based on a misleading translation of remarks the Democrat made at a Jan. 27 celebration of a Somalian election result. After an official with the breakaway republic of Somililand posted the speech, with captions claiming that Omar had declared herself âSomalian first,â Emmer called it a âslap in the face,â Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis called on her to be deported, and Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced a resolution to censure her.\n\nThe Minnesota Reformer published a translation refuting the original claim; Omar had never said âSomalian first.â In a statement, Omar said she felt âembarrassedâ for Emmer, and her Democratic primary opponents were more cautious than the GOP. Don Samuels, who nearly defeated Omar in a 2022 primary, said in a statement that heâd âreview an independent translationâ before reacting.\n\nSchiff for Senate, âTwo Visions.â Mail ballots for Californiaâs all-party March 5 primary go out next week, and Rep. Adam Schiff is trying to nudge Republican Steve Garvey into the general election by attacking him as a MAGA Republican. Itâs a reliable tactic in the state, which has held âjungleâ primaries for 12 years â Gov. Gavin Newsom elevated a weak Republican rival in 2018, getting the easy November matchup he wanted, instead of a potentially competitive race against a fellow Democrat. Rep. Katie Porter, who is polling close to Garvey, immediately accused Schiff of âboxing out qualified Democratic women candidates.â\n\nSuozzi for Congress, âBorder.â The Republican ad buys in New Yorkâs 3rd Congressional District â formerly held by George Santos, thus the special election â have focused almost completely on illegal immigration. The toughest hit: a clip of Tom Suozzi, the Democrat who used to hold the seat, saying heâd âkicked out ICEâ as Nassau County executive. Suozziâs response runs back a 2018 Fox News interview in which he denounced the campaign to âabolish ICE,â embraced (and later abandoned) by Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nJoe Biden for President, âConfused.â As Nikki Haley campaigns against Donald Trump, Democrats are clipping every one of her attacks â especially the ones on Trumpâs mental acuity. Two of them make it into this digital spot (âI think heâs decliningâ), capped with Biden calling Trump âconfused.â Polling has shown Biden at a massive disadvantage when voters are asked which candidate is more mentally sharp, and Democrats want to narrow that.\n\nCNN has conducted just three head-to-head polls testing Trump against Biden, with Trump ahead each time , driven by Bidenâs low approval rating â just 38% here. This is the first CNN poll offering Haley as an option, and she runs stronger with every demographic than Trump. Republican voters simply donât believe it. Seventy-two percent of them say that the party has a âbetter chance of winning the presidencyâ if Trump is nominated, up from 51% when the primaries began. Just 43% of white voters with college degrees think a Trump alternative (meaning Haley) would run stronger than Trump.\n\nHaleyâs problem in her home state mirrors her basic problem in New Hampshire: Republicans who know both her and Trump prefer the former president. Since September, as the rest of Trumpâs competitors dropped out, his favorable rating among GOP voters has risen from 60% to 66%. Haleyâs has dropped from 59% to 45%, and 43% of primary voters say theyâd be âupsetâ or âdissatisfiedâ if she became the nominee; just 29% say that about Trump. Haley runs strongest with the sort of voters who backed her last week, taking 61% of non-Republicans, who can vote in this primary, so long as they donât show up for the Democratic primary tomorrow.\n\nWhite House. Wednesday was the deadline for last quarterâs FEC filings, a trove of data about the campaigns getting underway and the candidacies that had already collapsed. The highlights:\n\nJoe Biden and the Democrats. Over a miserable period for his campaign â nonstop stories about low poll numbers, the last-minute candidacy of Dean Phillips â Biden raised $33 million , as the DNC and its joint fundraising committee with the president raised another $64 million. Phillips raised just over a million dollars from donors, and put $4 million of his own money into the campaign, ending the year with just over $360,000 to spend. Marianne Williamson raised more ($3.4 million since the start of 2023), and loaned herself nearly $500,000, ending the year with just over $208,000. Biden and his campaign groups: $117 million.\n\nDonald Trump. He raised $19 million in the last three months of the year; all told, Trump campaign groups ended 2023 with around $70 million to spend. That was after more than $55 million went to legal fees, an unprecedented expense for a presidential candidate.\n\nRon DeSantis. His campaign and its super PAC allies raised a total of $154 million last year, with diminishing returns â and in the final quarter, diminishing revenue. From October through the end of 2023, his campaign raised just $3.7 million from individual donors, and he ended the year with $9.7 million to spend.\n\nDeSantisâs killer app was supposed to be his super PACs. Never Back Down started the campaign with a $82.5 million cash infusion from his 2022 re-election PAC, a chunk of the more than $200 million heâd raised in that race. The money simply wasnât there for the White House bid. Never Back Down raised $14.5 million between June and December, and by mid-December the DeSantis operation was directing donors to a new PAC, Fight Right, which raised $13.3 million in a hurry. Most of that â $9.6 million â was handed over from Never Back Down.\n\nNikki Haley. Her campaign and super PAC avoided every mistake made by the DeSantis operation. Haley for President hoarded cash while the super PAC, SFA Fund, went on the air in Iowa and New Hampshire. The result: Haleyâs campaign ended the year with $14.6 million left to spend, $5 million more than DeSantis. SFA Fund raised $67.3 million last year, $50.1 million of it in the last six months. Its mission was keeping Haley afloat until the race narrowed down, and it succeeded, with nearly all of that money flying out the door; the super PAC entered 2024 with just $3.6 million.\n\nCharlie Kirk had more to say about Turning Point USAâs ambitions, before and after its visit to RNC turf. During a break in the conference, he talked with Americana about his influence in the GOP, the extremists the group had distanced itself from, and why he believed his commentaries on race werenât hurting his goal of finding and mobilizing more non-white conservatives.\n\nAmericana: What do you want to come out of this conference?\n\nCharlie Kirk: Itâs mission critical, victory in November. Thatâs not a mystery, right? I was present in 2020, and there were a lot of assurances, a lot of promises, by the existing infrastructure that is largely not changed, from personnel to the philosophy and mechanics. And Iâm not going to sit idly by and let that happen again.\n\nWe were taken by surprise by 10 or 12 different attack vectors in 2020. And weâre told that everythingâs fine, with no evidence of that. After many, many attempts at trying to get their attention, that hasnât changed. Competition is the driver of excellence. Thatâs one of our belief systems here. So why not host what it should be with some of the attendees of the RNC meeting later this week? What we believe really makes or breaks our elections is county chairs. We think county chairs are some of the least appreciated, most important elements in a modern political apparatus.\n\nAmericana: How ready are people for the primary to be over?\n\nCharlie Kirk: The appetite for a continued primary, at this point, is very cloistered in wealthy circles. And not even all wealthy circles. I would say that the majority of donors I talk to want this primary over. It just makes you wonder why Nikki Haleyâs continuing to run. The sooner we wrap up this primary, the better; every dollar, every resource is precious, and this is an unnecessary kind of annoyance. I have no fear that sheâs going to gain all this traction in Texas or in Florida or in California where the delegate count is extraordinary. I do have a fear that it can unnecessarily extend and delay a healing process.\n\nIn politics, after primaries, time heals all wounds. It just does. Iâm friends with people and we used to hate each other. Every month is going to heal what some of the people on TV are saying. âOh, 20% or 30% of people wonât vote for Trump. Yeah, but if you end the primary effectively now, will they still feel that way in June? Probably not. And if 2016 is instructive, it shows that they do come home. In fact, you can crack 90-95% of registered Republicans to come home to the nominee.\n\nAmericana: Have the Trump and DeSantis people already come together?\n\nCharlie Kirk: I think that there was some initial acrimony out of the gate, now largely healed. I mean, Iâm sitting down with one of them â Steve Cortes, whoâs a friend of mine, he went over to DeSantis, but weâre having a meeting this week, and weâre all good. I donât even think about DeSantis anymore, and I mean, in the positive way. Like, that page is turned. Thatâs old news, honestly.\n\nAmericana: On the show, you talked about Speaker Johnson calling you to talk about the border deal. What are you mobilizing to stop that?\n\nCharlie Kirk: Well, first of all, I donât think we know whatâs in the border deal. How dare you criticize it? Weâre not going to show it to you! Itâs one of the weirdest political stories Iâve seen in quite some time. [Sen. James] Lankford goes on TV and says, itâs a great deal and Iâm not going to show it to you. Also, the people that are attacking it are awful. Then can we see the text?\n\nIâve been awfully critical of Speaker Johnson. To his credit, he called me and I thought he was really, really magnanimous to call me because Iâve been awfully spicy towards him. Most politicians will send their little janissaries after me or whatever, so I give him a lot of credit for that. Yes, I hope that the border deal collapses.\n\nAmericana: About the TPUSA ambassador network â how do you police extremists who want in? Weâve seen a few cases recently of people appearing as ambassadors, saying that Jews run everything.\n\nCharlie Kirk: Iâll say two things. One, weâre redoing the whole ambassador program. Weâre rethinking it, reimagining it, in structure and attitude and philosophy. But look â some single individual who says that all Jews are pedophiles? Yeah, thatâs not a tough call.\n\nSo, you love the truth. Iâll send you a piece of clip, back from the fall, before the October 7 stuff. Thereâs a guy that comes up with Dennis Prager on stage, and heâs a real anti-Semite. Turns out heâs like this neo-Nazi guy, and I basically told him, in so many words, get the hell out of the event. If you go back many years ago, Iâve had a spirited history with such forces.\n\nAmericana: Groypers showing up and making trouble because you support Israel.Charlie Kirk: I love Israel. I always have.\n\nAmericana: So whatâs the line? Youâre winning, someone wants to join the winning team, but they have this belief so theyâre out.\n\nCharlie Kirk: Itâs hard for me to give you a formula. Let me use the line that determined the pornography decision at the Supreme Court: You know once you see it.\n\nAmericana: TPUSA has done a lot to reach out to a diverse set of people â Black Americans, Hispanic Americans. You also, on the show, are dealing with topics that get condemned by the SPLC. Telling people you were lied to about George Floyd, you were lied to about MLK. How do you balance those topics with the outreach?\n\nCharlie Kirk: I donât think itâs an either/or. At least from our grassroots experience, from Blexit and others, we see coalitions strengthening and building. But honestly, itâs not much of a political calculus. I donât like to sit around and think: is this topic going to help or hurt? Iâd say itâs more of an instinct. The reaction I received from black voices who I really trust â Candace Owens, Pierre Wilson, Brandon Tatum and others â is that thereâs this mass reconsideration movement in Black America. Have the idols, the motifs, the themes that weâve been lifting up, been benefiting us? And I think theyâre willing to reconsider some of those things.\n\nAmericana: You were doing this fairly early , with Kanye West â not recent Kanye, but talking about all this with him after he started wearing a MAGA hat.\n\nCharlie Kirk: I donât know how sizable it is, but I will say completely anecdotally, that I have more people of color, that are enthusiastically supportive of the program and the show just from just like, hey, walking into restaurants. I donât know if thatâs macro true, or if itâs confirmation bias. I have no idea, but itâs way more noticeable than it used to be. We make compelling arguments, we pursue truth, and itâs worked so far.\n\nAmericana: Have you seen any kind of backlash?\n\nCharlie Kirk: Itâs the opposite. More people want to speak with us than ever before. The part that Iâm learning is that the audience has a broader scope and just a deeper curiosity than I think we always give them credit for. They might not always agree with it. They might not always like the take, but itâs interesting, and they might learn something. We saw that in the MLK segment. People were like, wow, thatâs interesting. I never knew that. Itâs been overwhelmingly positive. In any indicating metric that I would be concerned about, thereâs no backlash.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

But even as the U.S. races toward the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, one group is at risk of suffering the consequences indefinitely: white conservatives.\n\nThat is already playing out in Indiana - and it could get worse.\n\nRepublicans as a group have been more likely to attend mass gatherings and less likely to wear masks than Democrats and independents. As IndyStar's Emily Hopkins and Shari Rudavsky reported, those behaviors contributed to rapid COVID-19 spread in rural, conservative communities across Indiana when the second wave hit in the fall."

      "text": "Opinion: Jon Gruden's emails not just an NFL problem. They're symbolic of societal white grievance.\n\nIf you want to fully understand why Jon Gruden resigned Monday after a trove of racist and misogynistic emails was unearthed like a giant vat of radioactive material, you must go back in time, from this week, this year, even this decade. You must go back to Nov. 4, 2008, when a Black man was elected President of the United States.\n\nWhen Barack Obama and his family stood before the world that election night, the belief is that moment accelerated the sense among some white conservatives that they were losing \"their\" country .\n\nGruden's email trail begins in 2011 and goes to 2018, and his outbursts parallel a yellow brick road of white grievance during that time span. In 2015, the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage in all states. The transgender community began asserting itself. Eight years before that, Nancy Pelosi became the first woman elected Speaker of the House. Conservatives saw NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick disrespecting \"their\" flag on the field of the sport they loved.\n\nFox News and other right-wing media saw all of this and fueled the belief that the social changes meant white people were under attack.\n\n\"What's always interesting to me is the degree to which you've seen created in Republican politics the sense that white males are victims,\" Obama said in 2020 . \"They are the ones who are under attack - which obviously doesn't jive with both history and data and economics. But that's a sincere belief, that's been internalized, that's a story that's being told, and how you unwind that is going to be not something that is done right away.\"\n\nAll of this is the key to the Gruden story.\n\nGruden's email reactions are about something bigger than sports. They read like a road map of white grievance and go to a larger issue of how a significant swath of white men (not all, of course) feel about the changing power dynamics in the country.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump rose to power assailing Obama as a fake American, railing against immigrants, wanting to ban Muslims, and he had a lengthy history of being accused of sexual assault. Trump also attacked Kaepernick. He recognized that white grievance was a selling point, the way a top chef sees that a certain combination of ingredients creates a meal with a nice kick.\n\nGruden's emails hit all of these points. It's rare to peel back a public curtain and see unvarnished, white grievance bro culture in action, but that's what you see with his emails. Gruden hits all the familiar targets. He denounced the emergence of women game officials, hated the drafting of gay player Michael Sam and attacked Kaepernick and protesting players.\n\nAs The New York Times noted, Gruden also criticized Obama during his re-election campaign in 2012, as well as then-Vice President Joseph Biden, whom Gruden called a \"nervous clueless (expletive).\" He used similar words to describe NFL commissioner Roger Goodell and DeMaurice Smith, head of the union.\n\nAgain, notice the targets. The Black president. The Black union head, with Gruden using a racist trope to describe him. The gay player. The women refs. He mocked Caitlyn Jenner, a transgender woman.\n\nThe shredding of Black people, the attacking of Black power, the attacking of powerful women, the attempt to diminish gay people, the attack on a transgender person. This is the White Male Grievance Hall of Fame. The only thing missing is a cameo from Curt Schilling and a video essay from Tucker Carlson.\n\nYou cannot tell the story of Gruden without telling the story of American white grievance.\n\nThere's another part of this story that's important. Gruden was also possibly supercharged by the environment created by Goodell and much of league ownership. When Goodell had his chance to push back against the grievance, particularly when it came to the protest movement, he mostly ignored the players. This energized the more extreme elements in the league who saw Black men protesting and, to me, felt an even deeper sense of losing power.\n\nGoodell had to apologize for not listening to the players sooner after the murder of George Floyd last year.\n\nThe league never punished former Texans owner Bob McNair after he referred to players as \"inmates.\" When McNair walked away unscathed after calling players criminals, it was again a wink and nod to the grievance community.\n\nWhat Gruden wrote in those emails was disgraceful. But it also followed a pattern, a predictable one, that's been developing since 2008 and started outside of the NFL.\n\nIt is grievance."

      "text": "We're not racists, but we're not colorblind: Column\n\nFalsely crying racism for political gain is a good way to make some people believe racism doesn't exist any more.\n\nI said that on Twitter the other morning and was treated to a barrage of inanity from liberal writers like Matt Yglesias and Oliver Willis . But the point I made is true and important. I'll elaborate here.\n\nHere's one problem I think we face in American race relations: Many people, including a lot of white conservatives, operate under the assumption that racism isn't really a problem in America today.\n\nWe don't have slavery, lynching, or whites-only bathrooms anymore, and in my experience almost all decent adults aspire to treat people equally regardless of the color of their skin. I wrote \"aspire to.\" I don't think most of us are always successful at this effort of treating all of God's children as equals, but we try, and every year, as a society, we succeed a little bit more, I think.\n\nI think it's pretty easy for a white person to (1) decide to treat black people equally, (2) assume he is treating black people equally, (3) if he witnesses no or very few acts of blatant racism decide that generally black people are treated equally, and then (4) conclude that the proper approach to race is total color-blindness.\n\nPreaching color-blindness often implies a couple of things: (A) completely rejecting any type of affirmative action; and (B) wanting minorities to quit putting so much stake in their minority-ness. Both of these stances are mistaken, in my opinion, because the premises behind the doctrine of color-blindness are mistaken.\n\nFolks who preach color-blindness, I think, often fall short on both introspection and empathy.\n\nOn introspection: It's really hard to actually be colorblind with strangers. You can probably forget that your friend is black, hispanic, or Indian. But when a stranger, or a rough acquaintance enters the picture, race probably subconsciously enters your judgment of that person. If you decide a certain character on the subway is sketchy, it's often for reasons you can't fully articulate. Clothes, demeanor, grooming, posture all matter. And sure, you'll be more wary of the leering tatted-out white dude than the black guy in a suit on his iPad. But skin color probably plays a role in your subconscious, even if it's not always the deciding factor.\n\nIn other words, even when you're trying to be color-blind, you're probably not being color-blind. This shouldn't be surprising. Man is a fallen creature.\n\nAnd this leads us to the empathy issue. Black males grow up being eyed with suspicion more than white males do - whether because of subconscious racism, people profiling based on crime statistics, or overt racism, it happens. So, if you say to a black person, \"stop acting as if your race matters,\" you're asking him to be color-blind in a society that isn't.\n\nProbably more important: even where no White Man is Keeping Them Down at the moment, African Americans still suffer from the legacies of slavery and Jim Crow. Black children are more likely to be born into poverty, and into a fatherless home, which makes it harder for them to get out of poverty, and more likely they will fall into crime - and maybe leave their own kid in fatherless poverty.\n\nThe average white person alive today may not bear any blame for this situation, but that's why I'm invoking empathy here - just because it's not your fault that a black kid started life with a disadvantage doesn't mean you should pretend he didn't start life at a disadvantage.\n\nI realize here many people will cite affirmative action and claim it's easier to make it as a black man. I think that's true in some microcosms, and only after clearing many hurdles. That is, if a black kid does well in school, gets good SATs, and keeps his life in order, he's more likely to get into Harvard, probably. But those initial hurdles are harder to clear for the average black kid who comes from, on average, a poorer home and went to, on average, a worse school.\n\nThe upshot: there are a lot of things where a well-meaning white guy might mistakenly think race is irrelevant or racism played no role.\n\nBut then there's another set of circumstances where the white conservative might disagree with a liberal attributing things to racism or race: when the liberal is just harping on race out of habit, out of dishonesty, out of honest mistake, or out of the first principle that white conservatives are per se racist.\n\nThere's an entire genre of journalism dedicated to finding racism in every criticism of Obama. Is there racism in some criticism of Obama? Sure. But consider these, just a few off the top of my head:\n\nOnce MSNBC asked if there were \"racial overtones\" to an anti-Obamacare protestor legally bearing arms. They even zoomed in on a holstered gun - so far that you couldn't see that the gun-toting protestor was a black man . NBC famously edited the 911 call of George Zimmerman to make him say \"This guy looks like he's up to no good. He looks black.\" They edited out the part where the dispatcher asked what Trayvon's race was .\n\nThrow in Joe Biden claiming Republicans want to put black people \"back in chains,\" and most of Al Sharpton's career, and you've got a toxic situation. While some liberals are correctly trying to convince some white conservatives that racism is more present than they think, other liberals are blatantly inventing or unfairly imagining racism where it doesn't exist.\n\nThis isn't a good way to begin a discussion. Soon, many white conservatives will believe almost all cries of racism are false, and some think it's clever to create the impression of rampant black-on-white racism - which is what it looks like Drudge is doing these days.\n\nMy points: We'd be better off if conservatives stopped believing that we are a color-blind society, and started accepting that life is generally harder for black people than for white people. We'd also be better off if liberals stopped instinctively assigning racist motives to political disagreements.\n\nTim Carney is a senior political columnist at The Washington Examiner .

      "text": "In 2018 midterms, campaign ads engaged in racist rhetoric\n\nThe barrage of racially divisive messaging in the 2018 midterm election cycle was inescapable.\n\nMailers depicted Jewish candidates clutching wads of cash. Robocalls in Georgia featured a person impersonating Oprah Winfrey, who described Stacey Abrams, running to be the first black female governor, as \"a poor man's Aunt Jemima.\"\n\nAttack ads in a New York congressional race cast an African-American candidate and Rhodes scholar as a \"big-city rapper.\" A Republican congressman in California sent out campaign literature questioning whether his Palestinian-Mexican opponent was a \"national security threat.\"\n\nLess than a week before Election Day, President Donald Trump tweeted a 53-second video that portrayed a caravan of asylum-seeking immigrants as an invading horde - a spot decried as racist. During Trump's presidential campaign, he labeled Mexicans as rapists and criminals.\n\nThe number of racially divisive ads was jarring, said political scientists and researchers who track political advertising.\n\n\"The new surge in nakedly racist appeals shows that, for a segment of the country at least, racism is no longer anything to be ashamed of,\" said Kevin Kruse, a history professor at Princeton University in New Jersey. \"While these attacks would have been seen as huge mistakes in previous decades, they're now seen by some strategists as a savvy move to mobilize a certain segment of white conservatives.\"\n\nThat can be attributed, in part, to the diversity of this year's Democratic candidates, which included a number of African-American, Latino, Muslim and Native American contenders, Kruse said.\n\nKruse said the turn to more overtly racist campaign messages can be traced to the Republican Party leader.\n\n\"Republican candidates do seem to be following the proven Trump blueprint of appealing to the fears and prejudices of white voters to a considerable degree,\" Kruse said.\n\nJamila Michener, a professor at Cornell University in New York who studies the intersection of race and politics, said Trump's rhetoric gave other Republicans permission to use language and race-baiting strategies once considered out-of-bounds.\n\n\"Look, if the commander in chief can open up his campaign by stigmatizing people who are immigrants and depicting them as rapists and that his campaign, continued at that pitch, with that level of racism, ends up being successful,\" Michener said, \"that's a signal to his counterparts across the political spectrum that our voters are open to this - and that at the very least, they will not dole out sharp consequences for it.\"\n\nIn the Florida gubernatorial race, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, who is black, was targeted by robocalls using offensive minstrel dialect and jungle music. Former Congressman Ron DeSantis, who  defeated DeSantis, called the attacks \"appalling and disgusting.\" DeSantis was accused of racism during the campaign after he said, \"The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state.\"\n\n\"I'm not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist,\" Gillum said in a debate. \"I'm simply saying the racists believe he's a racist.\"\n\nIn California's 50th Congressional District, Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter was re-elected, despite being indicted in August on charges of misusing campaign funds. His campaign was criticized for ads that tried to tie his opponent, Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar, who is of Palestinian-Mexican heritage, to radical Muslims and described him as a \"national security risk\" who is trying to \"infiltrate Congress.\"\n\n\"We stand by the ad. It's factually correct,\" Michael Harrison, a spokesman for the Hunter campaign, said on Election Day. \"There's nothing factually incorrect, and it's important for people to know.\"\n\nIn Iowa, GOP Rep. Steve King was re-elected to his seat in the 4th Congressional District even as he faced criticism for his ties to white nationalists, history of anti-immigrant and racist remarks and his support of a neo-Nazi party in Europe.\n\nThe Republican victories may clear the path for more racially charged rhetoric in campaigns, Michener said.\n\n\"It signals something to the other folks who are running about what the possibilities now are,\" Michener said. \"Unless it's alienating your own base in some way, or some part of your direct constituency, I don't think we're going to see as much disincentivization this year of this behavior as we might once have.\"\n\nIn the past, mainstream candidates tried to distance themselves from egregious advertising, such as the infamous Willie Horton campaign ad.\n\nThe ad, put out by a conservative PAC in support of George H.W. Bush's 1988 presidential bid, focused on Horton, a convicted murderer who committed a violent rape while out of prison on a furlough program supported by Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis. Lee Atwater, the Bush campaign manager, apologized for the \"naked cruelty\" of using Horton as political tinder.\n\nIn contrast, Kruse said, Trump seems to relish using charged rhetoric and tweeted the anti-immigrant ad, which was rejected as racist by CNN, then Fox News and NBC.\n\n\"Bush never would've pushed the mugshot ad under his own name, and certainly not personally, as all sides knew it would've killed his campaign,\" Kruse said. \"Trump put this out personally and proudly.\"\n\nPeople interviewed Tuesday were either repulsed by racist appeals or said they did not pay attention to the ads.\n\nDoris Flores shrugged off the negative tactics. \"I haven't really paid attention to them,\" said the 53-year-old nurse and Trump supporter, who is originally from the Philippines. Though she called the words coming out of the president's mouth \"horrible,\" Flores said she likes his policies.\n\nTammy Brackens, 48, a nurse who lives in a Houston suburb, condemned the ads as \"mudslinging and scare tactics.\" She acknowledged that they could be effective in driving people to the polls out of fear.\n\n\"They're disgusting, completely nauseating,\" said retired artist David LeJeune, 69, a Democrat who lives in the Houston area. \"Most of it is exaggeration completely geared to skew people who are easily manipulated.\"\n\nThere were significantly more negative ads during this year's midterms, according to an analysis by the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks political advertising. The number of negative ads rose 61 percent compared with 2014.\n\nSeventeen percent of Republican ads in federal races centered on immigration. \"This is where a lot of the racially tinged advertisements were being seen,\" said Travis Ridout, co-director for the Wesleyan Media Project. \"We were not seeing a lot of ads showing the wonderful contributions immigrants have made to the fabric of our country. They were making people scared of people coming across the border.\"\n\nMichener said the stoking of racial divisions runs deeper than the current political leadership. It's a continuation of dynamics long at play in American politics.\n\n\"President Trump has certainly sparked that. He's amplified it and exacerbated it, but he's working with what was already there,\" Michener said. \"A lot of that stuff has been embedded in our polity from before the beginning, before we were even the United States. It never goes away.\"\n\nAt times, she said, it is more latent. Other times, it is more blatant.\n\n\"This is a kind of blatant period for us,\" Michener said. \"Race and racism is out front as part and parcel of who we are as a country.\""

      "text": "Tennessee legislature showed lack of knowledge with critical race theory ban | Opinion\n\nOn May 5, the Tennessee General Assembly approved a House Education bill, which included an amendment that banned teaching any concepts related to race and racism. Gov. Bill Lee signed the bill into law on May 25.\n\nThe law follows a wave of legislation in Republican-controlled states across the country targeting education that teaches students about Critical Race Theory, CRT, in K-12 schools.\n\nIn disparaging language and false claims about history, Republican legislators misrepresented and mischaracterized CRT and educators who teach about race and racism. Here are five important points to consider about these attacks.\n\nHear more Tennessee Voices: Get the weekly opinion newsletter for insightful and thought provoking columns.\n\nThese actions are a part of a national coordinated strategy led by a small group of conservative think tanks, foundations and media outlets.\n\nThe moral panic against CRT is the latest bogeyman to challenge any attempts to reckon with the history of racism in this country over the last century.\n\nWhether it is about addressing the Reconstruction era of the late 1800's, the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's, or the current Black Lives Matter Movement, there has always been resentment and backlash by white conservatives when our country tries to grapple with racism, white supremacy, and police brutality against Black, Indigenous, and people of color in the United States.\n\nIt is apparent that those who want to ban \"critical race theory\" have no idea what the main tenets are that undergird the theory.\n\nThey conflate CRT, an explanatory framework used to understand the structure and ideology of race and racism that emerged out of legal studies, with any analysis of race and racial inequality that accurately describes the country's history of racism and how it continues to operate today.\n\nThere is CRT as understood and explained within the law, and there are interdisciplinary scholars ranging from history, education, sociology, philosophy, psychology, social work, and medicine, who study race and racism within their own disciplines.\n\nThe bill assumes that race is a natural identity when in actuality, race is a socially constructed political and legal category that rewards those racialized as white with privileges, opportunities, and resources that accumulate overtime.\n\nRacism is a system that is rooted in the ideology of white supremacy and can manifest at the individual, institutional, and structural level. Racism continues to shape every social system - the legal system, housing, education, work, media, and the criminal justice system - and all of these systems are interconnected.\n\nThat is what systemic racism means!\n\nIt means through a series of racist policies and practices, racism organizes every aspect of social life. For example, Black Tennesseans lead the state in deaths from COVID-19, and lack of access to effective and affordable health insurance . They are also more likely to live in poverty and racially segregated neighborhoods, and experience higher unemployment rates.\n\nIn addition, Black students in Tennessee are less likely to be placed in AP classes and more likely to experience out-of-school suspension.\n\nCRT outlines how there are subtle racist practices embedded in laws under the guise of racial neutrality that continue to perpetuate racism today. The bill's language that calls for \"impartial instruction\" of history and banning any lessons \"promoting division\" amongst racial groups gives the illusion of racial neutrality but is really designed to reproduce racism in U.S. society.\n\nBy not acknowledging that racism is a part of our history, it obscures the ways that racism continues to impact the health, well-being, and livelihoods of Black, Indigenous, and people of color today.\n\nThus, CRT challenges how laws create a perception of equality and colorblindness when in fact they actually hide or minimize systemic racism.\n\nThe foundation of systemic racism is embedded in the history of the United States. For example, our history in Tennessee is riddled with the reality of white supremacy despite our unwillingness to acknowledge it.\n\nTennessee practiced racialized enslavement, forcibly removed Indigenous populations, and terrorized Black Tennesseans with over 200 lynchings. Tennessee is also the birthplace of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nHowever, our history also includes stories of resistance.\n\nTennessee was home to Ida B. Wells who spoke out against the horrors of lynchings. Many important Black leaders in the Civil Rights Movement attended Historically Black Colleges and Universities in Tennessee. Rita Geier was the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit spanning over 30 years to desegregate higher education in the state of Tennessee.\n\nThe Highlander Education and Research Center in East Tennessee became a nationally recognized training ground for social justice organizers, such as Septima Clark, Rosa Parks, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nUltimately, the new law attempts to prohibit any meaningful discussions of racism, the history of white supremacy, and the power of resistance.\n\nIt uses fear and intimidation to silence freedom of speech, marginalize the contributions of racial justice scholars and activists, and minimize the voices and experiences of Black, Indigenous, and people of color in Tennessee.\n\nUntil we honestly and authentically grapple with the history of racism, we cannot begin to heal as a society. It is also important to increase our awareness about the contemporary reality of racism in order to fight against it.\n\nIn the words of Derrick Bell, legal scholar and one of the founders of CRT, \"The struggle for freedom is, at bottom, a manifestation of our humanity which survives and grows stronger through resistance to oppression, even if that oppression is never overcome.\"\n\nThus, we all must continue to actively resist racism in order to cultivate freedom, justice, and equity in this country.\n\nDr. Michelle Christian is an Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology at University of Tennessee-Knoxville and teaches and conducts research on race and racism, whiteness, and global political economy.\n\nDr. Jioni Lewis is an Associate Professor in the Department of Counseling, Higher Education, and Special Education at the University of Maryland, College Park; she teaches and conducts research on race and racism, intersectionality, and social justice."

Some on the right acknowledge that achieving unity is difficult, but think it's mostly a matter of rebuilding the platforms in which healthy debate happens.\n\nAs the co-creator of a national project centered on being civil and building understanding, I am regularly reminded that \"civility\" as a practice and \"unity\" as a goal are not universally embraced.\n\nThey have been used to silence people of marginalized communities, obstruct civil rights movements, and keep people from making meaningful, structural change.\n\nI understand the criticism of civility. After facilitating dozens of small group conversations and an online discussion group among people on the left, right and center, I also believe there's a version of this work that does not require compromising one's values.\n\nWhen Donald Trump was elected in 2016, I felt despair, but also motivation. As a progressive Asian woman in San Francisco, I wanted to pop my bubble and better understand people who voted differently than me.\n\nI partnered with my friend Tria Chang to organize a dinner between right and left leaning individuals rooted in listening and engaging respectfully. We called our project Make America Dinner Again , and four years later, we've organized hundreds of events in more than 20 cities and created an online discussion group with more than 900 members.\n\nIn 2020, I expanded my bridging work and joined Living Room Conversations, an organization founded in 2010 with a similar purpose of building understanding across differences.\n\nEngaging with perspectives from Libertarian anarchists, moderate Democrats, Constitutionalists, Democratic Socialists, Trump supporters and folks without a strong political identity has not weakened my own beliefs. Rather, this exposure has helped me realize what issues matter most to me.\n\nOne way I've learned is by listening to what stirs me.\n\nIn our discussion group, I've noticed that many of the views on race from white conservatives either glaze over or fail to acknowledge the long history of racism and oppression in our country, and the effects of intergenerational trauma.\n\nSome seem to value data more than stories of lived experiences. Reading what I perceived to be sterile assessments in response to the shooting of Ahmaud Arbery, for example, made my skin crawl. I felt angry.\n\nMy anger, in part, motivated me to put even more time into learning the historical and present day forms of racism and dig deeper into my interest in environmental justice.\n\nI filled my extra hours the way many people across the country did in response to heightened injustice and inequity in 2020 -- protested in the streets, read books, watched documentaries, wrote letters, made calls, donated and volunteered to be a poll worker on Election Day.\n\nThe MADA community has offered me many moments to reflect on my belief system and my gaps in knowledge. Reading others' views in favor of the death penalty, helped fortify my view against it. I learned the existence of progressive gun owners and pro-Second Amendment groups. Moderating a thread on Trans rights highlighted my clumsiness in standing up to transphobia.\n\nBeing in the bridging space, I've not felt like I need to choose between fighting for progressive policies and healing political divides.\n\nMany of my colleagues dedicate much of their time and energy to causes they care about outside of bridging. MADA co-creator Tria co-edits a Black Allyship column for an Asian American magazine. Fellow MADA moderator Ari Gabrek is a fierce advocate for the Trans community in Louisiana. Brialle Ringer, my colleague at Living Room Conversations , leads wellness retreats and promotes veganism.\n\nThrough interacting with hundreds of people with different opinions, I quickly learned my own biases around language and the assumptions I made about people.\n\nCertain phrases I had taken to be neutral like \"gun control,\" \"safe space\" and \"democracy,\" I learned actually weren't for many of our members. I noticed I had become comfortable making sweeping statements without qualifying them as opinion. I recognized the frequent assumptions I made about people based on their political identity, and I learned to ask better questions and to wait for people to share and show me who they are.\n\nThese are valuable skills not only in bridging divides between the right and left, but among people with more closely aligned politics, too.\n\nIn 2020, I more consciously brought my skill set to facilitating and having conversations about race. I began collaborating with Jeanelle Austin, a racial justice coach and activist, on a conversation series called Tea with the People . We facilitated small group conversations on race and democracy in the time of COVID-19 covering topics like inequities in health, public grief of anti-blackness, and the rise of anti-Asian sentiment and xenophobia.\n\nI organized similar conversations among my Asian American friends and had phone calls about anti-blackness with my parents for the first time.\n\nI felt more prepared to address tensions within these groups, having navigated outsized tensions between conservatives and liberals.\n\nOn a larger scale, I see these skills translating well in coalition-building among factions on the left. These are the skills we need to accomplish the vast work ahead of us like in developing a political agenda that progressive and moderate members of the Democratic Party can agree on, bringing together activists around issues like climate or women's rights, or defining the ambiguous Asian American voting bloc.\n\nI have gotten to know one of our discussion group's most vocal Trump supporters over the past three years. I've learned about his politics, but also, about his life. He shared stories about his hunting and fishing trips, what he was growing in his garden, and about a year into knowing him, he opened up about his divorce and the challenges of life being turned upside down. I listened and really felt for him.\n\nWhen I told him I had never been to Arkansas, where he lived, he invited me to visit and talked about all the places he might show me. I considered him an unexpected online friend, and though I had to moderate his comments \"for tone\" a few times, he hadn't crossed any of my personal boundaries.\n\nThat changed in April 2020 after I posted an article about the rise in anti-Chinese discrimination and hate crimes as a result of being blamed for COVID-19. I posed two questions: \"How have you witnessed anti-Chinese sentiment?\" and \"How do we separate our need to understand COVID-19 without dehumanizing other people?\"\n\nHe commented: \"Isn't that what people do? whites today get blamed for slavery in the 1800's, anyone looking oriental blamed for covid-19...\"\n\nHis communication style and crude language bothered me, but I was used to it. What upset me was that his first thought was to equate hate crimes experienced by Asian people to the experience of being blamed for slavery by white people. Those did not line up for me.\n\nI wrote back inviting him to chat one on one in hopes that we could have a conversation to better understand where each of us was coming from. The chat we had continued to be frustrating - there were times I could feel the heat rise on the back of my neck, and knew I needed a break.\n\nSince then, we've had a couple small exchanges; we've wished each other a happy holiday, and he reminded me of his invitation to visit him in Arkansas.\n\nThe actual work of healing is slow and its outcome is not guaranteed. To be sustainable, it requires prioritizing mental health. I can see my Arkansas friend's humanity, and appreciate that he helps me better understand conservatives, while also knowing that I'm not ready to revisit race with him now, and might never be.\n\nI'm aware that being able to reach across the aisle is a privilege. I've had a steady support system, and my relationship to this country is relatively new -- my parents immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan in 1979. The racial traumas I have had to work through are nowhere as deep or complex as for African Americans and Indigenous people.\n\nFor those trying to heal divisions and make amends with loved ones, colleagues and neighbors, the stakes are much higher. For people trying to make it through the day, this work is far from top of mind.\n\nWhen I hear leaders like President Biden call for \"unity\" \"civility\" and \"healing,\" I cringe a little, but not because the ask is impossible or repulsive.\n\nI cringe because leaders are missing an opportunity to shine a light on the path forward or to demonstrate the different ways coming together might look. They've failed to elevate the many thousands of organizations and people who have been doing this work for decades or to acknowledge the time, energy and emotional fortitude it requires.\n\nThey would be wise to emphasize that if you choose to do this work, you do not need to put your values aside. That, in fact, you might even find them strengthened.\n\nJustine Lee is cofounder of Make America Dinner Again and a partner with Living Room Conversations. Follow her on Twitter: @justineraelee"

      "text": "Think you know where 'woke' comes from? Inside the word's musical history - and influence.\n\nSomeday when the cultural moment that many have called \"The Great A woke ning\" is finally, mercifully, over, Americans of all races should fight to give African Americans their word back .\n\nLess than 10 years ago, \"woke\" was a word so deeply layered with history and meaning it could evoke years of pain suffered by descendants of slaves coming of age in Jim Crow America.\n\nYou don't have to be African American, however, to feel its history. The word woke is seminal to our larger culture in ways most of us have never understood.\n\nIt's one of the great words in American English, and it should be preserved in its purest form.\n\nAt the moment it is being hijacked by politics - first by white liberals then by white conservatives.\n\nThis week the word \"woke\" is igniting a family spat within the 2024 Republican primary for president, pitting Donald Trump against his former apprentice, Ron DeSantis.\n\nDeSantis, the Florida governor, uses the word frequently to describe an ideology steeped in identity politics that has taken over our universities, media, large corporations, medicine, arts, entertainment and sports.\n\nTrump argues he doesn't use the word: \"I don't like the term 'woke' because I hear, 'Woke, woke, woke.' It's just a term they use, half the people can't even define it, they don't know what it is.\"\n\nThere's a good chance none of us would know the word today had the Library of Congress not set out in the 1930s to preserve American folk music in the South .\n\nThat project took library archivists to Louisiana where they discovered a little-known African American blues singer named Huddie William Ledbetter , or \" Lead Belly .\"\n\nThe archivists recorded on aluminum discs Lead Belly and his 12-string guitar, preserving what would become some of the great Blues standards such as \"Cotton Fields,\" \"Goodnight, Irene\" and \"Rock Island Line.\"\n\nIn explaining to The Smithsonian Folkways Collection why he wrote the song \"Scottsboro Boys,\" about the nine African American young men falsely accused of raping two white women in Alabama in 1931, Lead Belly admonishes his listeners, \" Best stay woke !\"\n\nIt's possibly the first recorded instance of the word .\n\nAs Huddie Ledbetter used \"woke,\" it meant that when you're a Black person traveling through a deeply racist state such as Alabama, you need to know what you're dealing with - a highly refined form of evil. Lead Belly would know. He traveled the byways of Louisiana, Alabama and Texas singing his songs and confronting white bigotry and its violence against Black people.\n\nIn a way that history has of surprising us, Lead Belly would become essential to white culture in America and Great Britain. All white people reading this and learning the name Huddie Ledbetter for the first time should know that they have likely felt his influence, far more than they could have imagined.\n\nThe driving rhythms of Lead Belly's version of \" Rock Island Line \" would in the 1950s inspire an early British pop singer named Lonnie Donegan , who adopted the song's musical style called skiffle, a mash of American folk, blues and jazz.\n\nDonegan became \"the king\" of the British \"skiffle craze\" and eventually inspired new skiffle groups across England, such as Liverpool's The Quarrymen, then led by an aspiring singer-songwriter named John Lennon .\n\nBy 1960, the group would evolve into The Beatles, and its lead guitarist, George Harrison, would one day tell an interviewer, \"If there was no Lead Belly, there would have been no Lonnie Donegan; no Lonnie Donegan, no Beatles. Therefore, no Lead Belly, no Beatles ,\" as recounted by Smithsonian Magazine.\n\nLead Belly was inspiring many musical forms of that day. Those same early recordings that preserved his music and the word \"woke\" found their way into the imagination of another young artist of some note .\n\n\"Somebody - somebody I'd never seen before - handed me a Lead Belly record with the song 'Cottonfields' on it,\" recalled Bob Dylan in his 2017 lecture to the Noble (Prize) Foundation. \"That record changed my life right then and there. Transported me into a world I'd never known.\n\n\"It was like an explosion went off. Like I'd been walking in darkness and all of the sudden the darkness was illuminated. It was like somebody laid hands on me. I must have played that record a hundred times.\"\n\nBy the end of the century, Lead Belly's influence on American popular music was its own constellation of stars. Artists covering his songs included Gene Autry, Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Tom Jones, Harry Belafonte, Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, The Beach Boys, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, Tom Petty, the Grateful Dead.\n\nA young musician in Seattle named Kurt Cobain said he was inspired after hearing Beat Generation author William S. Burroughs tell an interviewer that the new rock 'n' roll kids should just throw away their guitars and listen to Lead Belly .\n\nOur chattering classes, and I include myself among them, have been poor caretakers of the word \"woke.\" When this battle over wokeness is finally over, it would do us well to give the word back.\n\nAnd while we're at it, maybe we could make the name Huddie \"Lead Belly\" Ledbetter, one of America's most important songwriters, as easily recognizable as, say, Ringo Starr.\n\nPhil Boas is an editorial columnist with The Arizona Republic, where this column was first published ."

      "text": "Trump seeks to gut a minority business agency decried by white conservatives\n\nManage your account\n\nAn executive order signed by President Donald Trump on Friday names several federal agencies he effectively intends to shut down, including a minority business department falsely portrayed by white conservatives as discriminatory toward white people.\n\nThe executive order lays out Trump's plans to axe seven government entities, including the Minority Business Development Agency , saying they each \"shall be eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.\"\n\nThe other agencies on the list are the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness; the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in the Smithsonian Institution; the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service; the Institute of Museum and Library Services; the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund; and the United States Agency for Global Media, which oversees the Voice of America news organization. My MSNBC colleague Steve Benen wrote a great piece about Trump's gutting of VOA and his broader attack on pro-democracy media outlets.\n\nThe Minority Business Development Agency was created during the Richard Nixon administration and has a self-described mission \"to promote the growth and global competitiveness of Minority Business Enterprises in order to unlock the country's full economic potential.\" Such programs have been under assault by white conservatives for some time, and Trump's closure of the agency can plausibly be seen as part of his perverse vow to address \"anti-white feeling\" as president, despite it not existing in any systemic form.\n\nA year ago, I wrote about a Trump-appointed judge's ruling that the program, which helps minority-owned businesses that have long faced discrimination and marginalization, must serve white people because it was effectively discriminating against them . And last week, I wrote about the Trump administration's demand that the city of Asheville, North Carolina, amend its Hurricane Helene draft recovery plan to remove a reference to assistance for businesses owned by minorities and women.\n\nThis entirely predictable scenario, in which Trump and his allies kneecap key government programs meant to aid nonwhite people, is precisely why I took an interest in reporting on Black philanthropy while writing for The ReidOut Blog back in 2021. Private giving and intra-communal investment among nonwhite people is not, in my view, an effective stand-in for the federal aid that minority-owned businesses deserve. Especially since minority-focused philanthropic organizations have faced \"lawfare\" from white conservatives, too .\n\nBut philanthropy and private investment are likely to become even more vital for minority-owned businesses under a Trump administration apparently dead set on dismantling federal tools that help these businesses survive and thrive.\n\nThis article was originally published on MSNBC.com"

      "text": "Column: The once-secretive right-wing ideology emerging as an overt threat to American democracy\n\nManage your account\n\nLast week, Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley admitted something that might have once shocked his party.\n\n\"Some will say I'm calling America a Christian nation,\" Hawley told an audience at the National Conservatism Conference in Washington. \"And so I am. Some will say I'm advocating Christian nationalism. And so I do. My question is: Is there any other kind worth having?\"\n\nConservative Christian supremacy is on the march.\n\nIn Oklahoma, the state's top education official has ordered the public schools to put a Bible in every classroom and incorporate its teachings into their lessons.\n\nIn Louisiana, officials have decreed that every public school classroom must display the Ten Commandments.\n\nWhat is going on in our nation, which was founded on the principles of religious freedom and separation of church and state?\n\n\"Josh Hawley would not have said that a year ago,\" said Stephen Ujlaki, producer and director of the stunning new documentary \" Bad Faith: Christian Nationalism's Unholy War on Democracy .\" But these days, he said, Christian nationalists \"are feeling more empowered. Their goal is to act as though they have already won and cow everyone into going along with it.\"\n\nSix years ago, Ujlaki, who was ending his term as dean of the Loyola Marymount University School of Film and Television, decided to figure out how Donald Trump - adulterer, sexual abuser, compulsive liar - could become president with the rabid support of voters who claim to espouse Christian values.\n\nWhat he came to understand is that Trump's presidency and enduring popularity among the most extreme religious conservatives are the products of a 50-year-old political movement. Christian nationalism aims to turn back the clock on a century of American social progress by exploiting white conservatives' anxiety over the demographic and political shifts that are changing the country.\n\nChristian nationalists don't exactly identify with Trump; rather, he is their vessel and their wrecking ball, and he's been wildly successful in that sense. Who would have imagined years ago that a Supreme Court reshaped by the real estate mogul would obliterate half a century of reproductive rights?\n\nIndeed, a Republican member of Congress said on the floor of the House Thursday that the country should \" work our way back \" to 1960 if Trump is elected, decrying the emasculation of men by an \"angry feminist movement.\"\n\nChristian nationalism is a white supremacist political ideology masquerading as religion.\n\n\"They are pretend Christians,\" said Christianity Today editor Russell Moore ,  who left the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission over its support for Trump in 2016.\n\nThe movement did not arise, as is widely believed, in response to the Supreme Court's landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion. It formed years earlier in response to decisions ending the tax-exempt status of racially segregated schools such as Bob Jones University. Abortion simply became a more palatable cover than racism.\n\n\"The big idea of Christian nationalism is that God made America for a particular kind of white Christian with a particular ideology and worldview,\" said Eboo Patel, the founder of Interfaith America, which promotes religious diversity. \"That group is supreme and everyone else is subordinate, and they need to be kept subordinate with violence if necessary.\" (See: Jan. 6.)\n\nOn the advice of his friend and fellow documentarian Ken Burns, Ujlaki takes a chronological approach in \"Bad Faith,\" going back to the 1981 founding of the secretive, extremely well-funded Council for National Policy by archconservative Christian activists. Among them was Heritage Foundation co-founder Paul Weyrich, who once said, \"I don't want everybody to vote. As a matter of fact, our leverage in the elections quite candidly goes up as the voting populace goes down.\"\n\nThe Washington Post described the council in 2021 as \"the most unusual, least understood conservative organization\" in the capital. It bars the press from its events, and its members, including former Vice President Mike Pence and insurrection supporter Ginni Thomas, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' wife, \"agree to remain silent about its activities.\"\n\nOne of the council's many interconnected allies is the Heritage Foundation, whose more than 900-page Project 2025 is considered a blueprint for a second Trump administration. The document espouses the goals of Christian nationalism: dismantling the administrative state by replacing civil servants with Trump worshipers, slashing regulations, gutting protections for gay and transgender people, abolishing the Department of Education, requiring all pregnancies to be carried to term, making it harder for some people (guess who?) to vote and shrinking the social safety net (because if you're poor, that's on you).\n\n\"This is not Jim Crow,\" the Rev. William Barber II, who founded the Yale Divinity School's Center for Public Theology & Public Policy, says in \"Bad Faith.\" \"This is James Crow, Esq. He went to school, got a law degree and has come back to take out every progressive voice in this nation.\" (Exhibit A: Hawley, Stanford '02, Yale Law '06.)\n\nA February Pew Research Center poll found that less than half of U.S. adults said they had ever heard or read anything about Christian nationalism. \"Most Republicans,\" Pew reported, \"say they have never heard of Christian nationalism.\" It's scary that Americans know very little about the movement that is trying to wrench them into the past.\n\nNo one has captured the warped ethos of the Christian nationalist movement better than the white supremacist homophobe Nick Fuentes, who appears briefly but memorably in \"Bad Faith.\"\n\n\"F- democracy,\" Fuentes says. \"I stand with Jesus Christ.\"\n\nExcept, you know, he really doesn't.\n\n@robinkabcarian\n\nIf it's in the news right now, the L.A.

      "text": "How white supremacists appropriated a Megan Thee Stallion song\n\nManage your account\n\nWith their tortured adoption of words like \" woke \" and \" based ,\" white conservatives (men, in particular) have shown that they get a kick out of appropriating Black lingo.\n\nThat trend is in focus again thanks to a video from an event held for Donald Trump over the weekend. On Sunday, the presumptive Republican nominee for president delivered a speech at The People's Convention , a gathering in Detroit hosted by right-wing activist group Turning Point Action and its founder, conservative agitator Charlie Kirk. Ironically, the appearance came after an event where Trump portrayed himself as a political ally to Black voters .\n\nKirk and his associates are known for spewing racist bile from Kirk's podcast and their personal social media accounts. And, in fact, a viral video from The People's Convention shows some of those associates waving a flag and handing out hats with the phrase \"White Boy Summer.\"\n\nThe scene had the same absurdist feel as many right-wing events these days (which, for the record, I think is deliberate). But goofy as it may seem, this is not something we should take lightly.\n\nThis phrase, which the Anti-Defamation League notes has become become popular among white supremacists , first began as a variation of a statement of womanly pride by rapper Megan Thee Stallion. Megan popularized the phrase \"Hot Girl Summer\" in 2019 to promote women's independence and bodily autonomy. She faced misogynistic backlash for promoting these things, spurring some men to promote the phrase \"Hot Boy Summer\" as a cringeworthy competitor. Then, white men - such as Tom Hanks' son Chet - appropriated the phrase to create \"White Boy Summer\" as a declaration of their purportedly fleeting summertime freedom.\n\nAnd that's how we arrive in the present day, where the phrase \"White Boy Summer\" has become a way for white supremacists to promote what is essentially unhinged white hypermasculinity (and all the oppressive bigotry it represents). And that's why, as silly as it may seem to discuss, it's significant that the organizers of an event for the presumptive GOP presidential nominee would tout it. It certainly speaks to the true driving force behind Trump's campaign: white men.\n\nRelatedly, Media Matters just published an excellent report on the The People's Convention and how Kirk's Turning Point organizations carefully use popular figures and phrases linked to white nationalism - like \"White Boy Summer\" - to promote their ideas within the Republican National Committee and the Trump campaign.\n\nYou can check the report out here .\n\nThis article was originally published on MSNBC.com"

      "text": "From white conservatives to black liberals, coronavirus misinformation poses serious risk\n\nManage your account\n\nThere's a kind of public and collective schadenfreude taking shape on black Twitter.\n\nIt began after Diamond and Silk, among the best known and most outspoken black supporters of President Donald Trump, were reported to have parted ways with Fox News after they promulgated unproven and dangerous medical advice, false claims, conspiracy theories and misinformation about the coronavirus outbreak .\n\nSome of the posts on the women's social media accounts have been removed, and at least one account was briefly suspended . The women, who describe themselves as \"opinionators,\" falsely told their online and television fans that the coronavirus was a ruse to fell Trump in the November election , as well as a fantastic plot crafted and controlled by the \" globalist elitists \" to manipulate Americans and \"wreak havoc on our lives.\" They recommended that more Americans should not practice social distancing based on the as-yet medically unproven idea that it would confer lasting immunity against the coronavirus to more of the population .\n\nFox News, as well as Diamond and Silk, did not respond to requests for comment. But black Twitter, and indeed much of Twitter in general , has had no shortage of responses.\n\nThe irony is that the misinformation amplified by Diamond and Silk and others has gained traction in conservative, mostly white social media spaces and black, mostly left-leaning online spaces, too. Concepts similar enough to pass as first cousins on the misinformation family tree have proliferated in social media spaces that do not usually cross or blend.\n\nOne example: false conspiracy theories related to the tech billionaire Bill Gates' health care philanthropy . In conservative white spaces, there are unsubstantiated claims that the coronavirus is Gates' route to disease profit, a crafty government surveillance system or a man-made population-control mechanism with unfair economic consequences. When those fictional claims moved to conservative black Twitter, misinformation cast the virus as a black population reduction device, a useful if unplanned excuse for aggressive and unfair government monitoring or a poverty boosting tool. Once the misinformation circulated among left-leaning black social media, it often described the coronavirus and the resulting disproportionate death toll as racial population shaping. In those circles, social distancing measures were also sometimes described as a green light for abusive policing.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"What you have are the same, often very dangerous, ideas repackaged in a way that makes sense to very different groups of people,\" said Shireen Mitchell, a researcher who studies online disinformation and harassment. \"And it's distrust in government, in the establishment, in institutions that are the connective tissue - they're a prevailing theme that makes these wild ideas seem true to those who believe.\"\n\nTech\n\nYears before the word Gamergate took on public meaning, Mitchell identified a pattern of harassment and doxing used to silence black women and girls. Then the same thing began happening to white women in gaming forums. In 2015, Mitchell and a small group of other black feminists began sounding the alarm about suspicious social media posts . They were written by people no one in the activist community had ever heard of, and they relied on sometimes laughable attempts at the black vernacular and cartoonishly offensive, extreme versions of activist ideas. It seemed to Mitchell then that someone was trying to stir up animosity and confusion.\n\nNow, something strange is happening with coronavirus misinformation, and she is deeply concerned that it could have real consequences, such as online voter suppression, the focus of her current work. A lot of coronavirus myths are showing up in social media spaces where voting is the ostensible topic of conversation.\n\nIt was there at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic that utterly false claims of black immunity spread like weeds. That happened while COVID-19 actually proliferated in the United States in ways that would ultimately produce a disproportionate death toll among black, Latino and Native Americans.\n\nLater, unproven stories took hold that the virus was the work product of labs in various countries, including China and the U.S., followed by false claims about vaccine-related moneymaking schemes controlled by a tech billionaire and about the virus' being spread by cellphone technology . All three ideas jumped from mostly white, conservative circles to mostly black and politically liberal ones, where they have often been amplified by black social media influencers and celebrities.\n\nThe problem is so serious that the World Health Organization has called it an \"infodemic,\" and it secured unprecedented cooperation from many American social media companies to tag, remove and otherwise try to limit the spread of misinformation. But that has had only limited success .\n\nIn the early weeks of the crisis in the U.S., there was already some evidence that critical differences of opinion had emerged along racial lines. In a March survey of 673 adults by Northwestern University's Center for Applied Health Research on Aging, analysts found that black respondents described themselves as less worried and viewed themselves as less likely to get COVID-19, yet also felt less prepared for an outbreak compared to white Americans.\n\n\"Bad actors - foreign and domestic - have seized this public health crisis as an opportunity to generate panic and sow distrust by spreading disinformation, often targeted at communities of color,\" Ben Block, digital rapid response director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in an email. \"Amid a chaotic response from the Trump Administration and House Republicans dismissing the guidance of medical professionals, these dangerous disinformation campaigns that spread demonstrably false narratives pose serious threats.\"\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, a party arm dedicated to electing Democrats to the House, began tracking online misinformation after the 2016 election. In March, the organization's digital rapid response team and an outside research agency noticed an uptick in coronavirus misinformation circulating heavily among black social media users.\n\n\"I am not surprised that disinformation is being spread,\" Block said in an interview. \"I am surprised and troubled by the fact that COVID-19 is being used as a hook and as a way to further spread that disinformation, attaching a pandemic to issues such as voting rights and ... health care.\"\n\nDemocrats fear that misinformation about the disease, as well as some longstanding false claims by Republicans about widespread voter fraud , will dampen support for alternatives to in-person voting.\n\nThe risks are clear: At least 52 cases of COVID-19 have been possibly linked to in-person voting or polling site work during Wisconsin's primary April 7.\n\n\"There are tons of narratives that present themselves every day,\" said Jacquelyn Mason, a research analyst at First Draft News who is studying disinformation surrounding the coronavirus pandemic and the election. \"Considering the current climate and how detrimental that could be to a lot of people's health and welfare, we decided to do some work in this world, where you can really begin to see some consistent themes circulating in different communities.\"\n\nIn April, anti-social distancing sentiment moved from online commentary to protests at some statehouses. Researchers and reporters have uncovered the role of conservative commentators and commercially motivated online agitators in drawing mostly white and conservative protesters to the events. There, because of a lack of social distancing and inconsistent mask use, the virus itself may have spread.\n\nTech\n\nMason said she has also noted a growing number of posts in black social media networks expressing fatalistic, infection-is-inevitable messages. She said rumors have increased among black people on social media about hydroxychloroquine - a longtime anti-malarial medication that was touted by Trump as a treatment for COVID-19 and purchased by the Bureau of Prisons but later proven to be dangerous or ineffective . Unsubstantiated claims have spread that it will be tested on black subjects who are unwilling or have not been informed. Both could dampen acceptance of future treatments and vaccines.\n\n\"If we take a laundry list of all the ways America has done black folks, Latino folks, Native American folks, Asian folks wrong, all sorts of things start to feel very plausible,\" said Niambi Carter, an assistant professor of political science at Howard University who researches and writes about public opinion and political behavior. \"There is a well-earned distrust in some communities that allow conspiracy theories to flourish. They seem to explain real things, even if totally false. And where black people are concerned, sometimes the seemingly unbelievable turns out to be true.\"\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe truth, Carter said, is that in black America, \"all roads effectively lead back to Tuskegee .\" That is a reference to the 40-year government-funded experiment conducted on hundreds of black men who, without their knowledge, were not treated for syphilis but instead were allowed to suffer and die from it and pass it on to others. It ended in 1972. The U.S. government has also been involved in birth control experiments and involuntary sterilization programs conducted in Puerto Rico and on the mainland on Native American women, as well as the poor .\n\nBelief in conspiracy theories and the spread of misinformation does not begin and end with black social media users, said Michelle Amazeen, an assistant professor of mass communications specializing in media, propaganda and misinformation at Boston University.\n\nWhat Amazeen and her research partner, Erik Bucy, a professor of strategic communication at Texas Tech University, found is that what makes a person vulnerable to misinformation is media knowledge - how well a person understands how news is gathered and what standards a piece must meet for publication or broadcast at different types of outlets and, therefore, which sites, publications and outlets are reputable and reliable sources of accurate information.\n\nPeople most vulnerable to misinformation, they found, were more likely to believe and share \"news\" gleaned on social media. They also found that those people were more likely to overestimate how well they understood a topic.\n\n\"It's really like 2016 again,\" Bucy said. \"The crisis of COVID has produced this explosion of scams, misinformation and maybe more. There's all kinds of great, high-quality, accurate information out there, but you have to go and get it and be aware of where to find it. And that, it turns out, is the problem for a lot of people.\""

      "text": "Though home to about 50 white extremist groups, Ohio's social and political landscape is undergoing rapid racial change\n\nManage your account\n\nThe first time many Americans heard about Springfield, Ohio, came during the September 2024 presidential debate when Donald Trump falsely claimed that Haitian immigrants in the city were eating other residents' cats and dogs.\n\nThough shocking, these harmful rumors had been spreading on social media since the beginning of the summer and had gained more notoriety when JD Vance, a U.S. senator from Ohio and Trump's running mate, made similar statements on X , the social media platform formerly called Twitter.\n\nBut what has gone mostly overlooked is the effect these racist lies have had on energizing Ohio's nearly 50 white extremist groups .\n\nMembers of the white supremacist group Blood Tribe marched through Springfield on Aug. 10, 2024 , with with swastikas on their signs.\n\nSince then, members of the Ku Klux Klan and the right-wing extremist group Proud Boys have each marched in separate demonstrations through Springfield.\n\nAs scholars of extremism who live in Ohio and work at the University of Dayton, we have seen these events unfold at a time when city officials have received multiple bomb threats targeting local government offices and schools since Trump's false and racist claims against Haitian immigrants.\n\nIn our research, we have found that the rapidly changing social conditions in Ohio have played a significant role in the growth of extremism.\n\nBetween 1990 and 2019, for instance, manufacturing jobs shrank from 21.7% of all employment in the state to 12.5%, a loss of nearly 360,000 jobs. As a result, income disparities between the professional and working classes have widened - as has the heightened sense among some alienated white men that white conservatives are the real victims of bias in a society growing more racially and culturally diverse.\n\nFor many of these alienated men, particularly those in rural areas that lack significant numbers of Black and Hispanic residents, extremist ideologies offer easy answers to complex questions that involve their sense of disenfranchisement.\n\nIn 2020, for example, the population of Springfield was about 60,000. But over the past three years, city officials estimate that the population has grown by about 25%, partly fueled by the arrival of as many as 15,000 Haitian immigrants during that time. Many of them are legally living in the U.S. under a special federal program.\n\nSimilar demographic shifts are occurring throughout the state. Between 2010 and 2022, the percentage of the white population dropped from 81.2% to 77.3%, a loss of about 250,000, putting the state's white population at about 9.1 million. During the same time, the Hispanic population, for instance, grew from about 357,000 in 2010 to nearly 525,000.\n\nFor some of these white extremists, these population changes will lead to an inevitable race war between white people and nonwhite people. We have found that the attraction of belonging to a group that promises strength, protection and a source of identity can be particularly compelling.\n\nIn recent years, white extremism in Ohio has received attention as a result of the extremist rhetoric of and often violent crimes committed by white men who call the state home. Consider just a few examples:\n\nBorn and raised in Ohio, Andrew Anglin founded the Daily Stormer, a popular neo-Nazi website , in 2016.\n\nJames Alex Fields Jr. , a white nationalist from the Toledo area, was sentenced to life in prison in 2019 for the murder of Heather Heyer in Charlottesville, Virginia. Fields was convicted of driving his car into a crowd of counterprotesters during the white nationalist Unite the Right Rally in August 2017.\n\nPrior to the attack, Fields frequently posted the hashtag #Hitlerwasright on his social media accounts and called for violence against nonwhites and Jews.\n\nIn the summer of 2022, Ohio law enforcement officers shot and killed Ricky Shiffer after the armed Navy veteran fired a nail gun at the FBI field office in Cincinnati. On his social media accounts, Shiffer had called for violence against federal law enforcement officials after the FBI searched Donald Trump's residence at Mar-a-Lago as part of the federal probe into Trump's handling of classified documents.\n\nTres Genco, a self-described incel - short for \" involuntary celibate \" - who hated women and believed he was owed sex from them, was from the Cincinnati area and pled guilty in 2022 to plotting a mass shooting of women at Ohio State University. Law enforcement officials in Ohio stopped the planned attack before it happened.\n\nOn April 21, 2023, Christopher Brenner Cook , 20, of Columbus, Ohio, and others were sentenced to nearly eight years in prison for his plan to attack power grids across the U.S. Cook and his accomplices believed that they were starting a race war and used neo-Nazi propaganda and white supremacist ideology to recruit young people to join their group.\n\nLeaders of white supremacist and militia groups often use both traditional outreach and digital platforms to recruit people to their groups. Traditional outreach includes recruitment in conversations, attending events, and sharing books, pamphlets, flyers and posters.\n\nAt the same time, social media has become a critical tool for extremist groups to spread their message, recruit members and organize events.\n\nThese online platforms create echo chambers that reinforce extremist beliefs in debunked conspiracy theories, such as the assumption that the federal government is part of a plot to eliminate the white race.\n\nIn addition to the increased traffic on social media, we have seen a rise of extremist groups in Ohio known as active clubs , where members engage in physical fitness, combat training and emotional support that encourages the development of a warrior mentality in preparation for what followers believe is an inevitable race war.\n\nThough the emergence of white extremist groups goes far beyond the borders of Ohio, we have found that community-based, educational initiatives are effective in understanding and ultimately eradicating the root causes of racial and ethnic hatred on the local level.\n\nIn our view, community engagement that emphasizes dialogue and understanding across different racial groups is crucial for demonstrating the dangers of intolerance - and the benefits of diversity.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation , a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world. It was written by: Paul J. Becker , University of Dayton and Art Jipson , University of Dayton\n\nFaced with a rise of extremism within its ranks, the US military has clamped down on racist speech, including retweets and likes\n\nWhite supremacists who stormed US Capitol are only the most visible product of racism\n\nWhite power movements in US history have often relied on veterans - and not on lone wolves\n\nPaul J.

      "text": "Shoutout To My DEIs: Black Twitter Redefines The Term 'DEI' After White Conservatives Try To Make It Racist Slur\n\nManage your account\n\nThe term DEI , which refers to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, was recently trending on X (formerly known as Twitter) but not for typical reasons. Since its inception in the 1960s, DEI has been intended to describe initiatives and programs promoting diversity, equity and inclusivity - usually in employment and organizations. During the Black Lives Matter movement, companies pledged to amplify Black employees and create positions focused on inclusive culture.\n\nNow, as there's an increase to erase remnants of Black history from books, curriculums and monuments, many trolls are attempting to do the same with acronyms. \"DEI\" was recently trending on X after it was twisted to mean \"Didn't Earn It\" - alluding to the thought that minority people who may have benefited from DEI programs and initiatives \"didn't earn it.\"\n\nNaturally, Black folks called out their disrespect and decided to find the humor in it all. Black Twitter began using \"DEI's\" as a tongue-in-cheek way to turn the term back into a pro-Black statement.\n\nOne user called out the shady use of the acronym after it was used to describe Baltimore's Mayor Brandon Scott.\n\nThis X-user said the term was off-limits since they wanted to make it about race.\n\nAnother said let's put a little rhythm behind it.\n\nAnd this one loved that Black people once again overshadowed hate by taking over the trending spot.\n\nMayor Scott would later appear on MSNBC to address the negative use of \"DEI.\" He spoke with host Joy Reid and expressed how young Black men are often demonized in today's society.\n\n\"Black men and young Black men, in particular, have been the boogie man for those who are racist and think that only straight, wealthy white men should have a say in anything,\" he said.\n\nHe went on to once again reclaim the meaning of \"DEI\" but noted the intent behind its malicious use.\n\n\"What they mean by DEI, in my opinion, is duly elected incumbent. We know what they wanna say, but they don't have the courage to say the N-word,\" he said."

      "text": "Idaho at the epicenter of American Redoubt, white Christian nationalism movement | Idaho\n\nManage your account\n\nIt's not often I read a book about our challenging times and find Idaho prominently featured, but that's how things turned out when I read \"Preparing for War: The Extremist History of White Christian Nationalism and What Comes Next,\" by Bradley Onishi.\n\nThe author, a former white Christian nationalist with nine years in the evangelical movement, including six years in ministry, left the church, earned a doctorate in religious studies and assumed a teaching position at the University of San Francisco.\n\nHe wrote \"Preparing for War\" after Jan. 6, 2021, when he realized that the terrorist assault on the Capitol was the result of white Christian nationalist rhetoric over the years. The book explains how the rise of the new religious right gave birth to white Christian nationalism and how it might play out in the future in even more dangerous and destructive ways.\n\nHe now describes his former church affiliation as a movement thoroughly entrenched in American nationalism, white supremacy, patriarchy and xenophobia.\n\nOnishi draws an important distinction between white evangelicalism and white Christian nationalism, which he claims far exceeds the boundaries of white evangelicalism.\n\nWhite Christian nationalism marries cross and flag and creates the myth of America founded as a Christian nation. It also reflects on what it sees as America's covenant with God in recognizing its past glory when straight white Christians had exclusive control of America's politics and culture. Finally, such loyalty and obedience to a God whose nation has failed him creates an apocalyptic vision for white Christian nationalists to act out of a crisis narrative that demands the kind of immediate action we witnessed on Jan. 6.\n\nBrad Onishi had a front-row seat in the growth of the evangelical movement in Orange County, California, where he was raised. He witnessed the Sun Belt migration as white Southerners headed West to recreate their own version of white Christianity, a potpourri of Christian nationalist mythology, libertarian economics and cowboy individualism. Voila! Orange County becomes the epicenter of white Christian nationalism. But its vision was overridden by a California that won the Oscar for the most liberal state in the Union, far outnumbering the white conservatives in Orange County.\n\nAnd here's the part of the narrative where Idaho appears stage right. An entire chapter is devoted to an influx of conservative Californians and white Christian nationalists to Idaho and neighboring states.\n\nOnishi credits James Wesley Rawles, a former military intelligence officer, with applying the term American Redoubt to the intermountain states of Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and parts of Eastern Washington. The American Redoubt is the intermountain region where white Christian nationalists seek to take over local governments and cultivate Christian nationalist churches, all toward the goal of setting up a theocratic society. Rawles' website expands on the preparedness required for a Second Civil War he predicts between the right and the left.\n\nThis is not a tale Idahoans have trouble understanding given Meridian's recent experience of a California transplant who attempted to abolish the library district. California plates are as plentiful in Boise these days as Idaho potatoes. Although all Californians moving to Idaho certainly do not fit the mold of white Christian nationalist, sidle up to a bar in Boise next to a displaced Californian and you are likely to hear a lecture on how expensive it is to live in California and how much his home's equity was worth in the Idaho housing market. But it's also possible that you will get a riff on the liberal state and the conservative ecstasy of living in a state where the right wing is in its ascendancy.\n\nOnishi counts at least 50 people from his home community of Yorba Linda who he knows have moved to Idaho, which he claims has gone from \"flyover country\" to the hottest region west of the Mississippi. No argument there.\n\nSome Idahoans when first hearing of California's \"wagon train in reverse\" heading to the Gem State may rejoice to think of the newbies serving as a moderating influence on Idaho's increasingly conservative politics. Onishi dashes those expectations by citing Boise State research showing the new Californians more conservative than native Idahoans.\n\nOnishi portrays many of our new residents as seeking a self-segregated white Christian society without the bother of religious, racial or ethnic minorities. I'm sure Boiseans could quibble with Onishi on some of his generalizations applying to their city, but it's very difficult to question his premise when you leave Boise for the rest of Idaho. Onishi cites various iterations of the American Redoubt, naming and quoting political/religious leaders setting up their own Christian fortresses in Moscow and Coeur d'Alene, Idaho and Spokane, Washington.\n\nNo matter where you travel in the United States today, there is a recognition of Boise as a city on the move and a state growing by leaps and bounds. What is less obvious is this parade of people who move to Idaho to separate themselves from the United States of America, not just California. They are hoping they can remove themselves from a nation growing increasingly diverse by finding refuge in Idaho and other intermountain states.\n\nA manifestation of the Redoubt's effort at the state level to assume control of Idaho's local governments is the ongoing attack Republican legislators wage on what they call \"woke\" ideology but is really nothing but an assault on a compendium of current statutes that trust local governments to act on behalf of their citizens.\n\nThey also target the word \"diversity\" in their efforts to expunge any reference to schools' preparing students for a workplace and society quite different from the all-white existence these extremists attempt to build in Idaho. And they continue to take aim at their favorite target - the teaching of racism and America's history of slave holding, which they package in neatly bound critiques of gibberish that ignores our slave-holding past and the racism still deeply embedded in our society.\n\nIf you travel out Military Reserve Road, you can visit the Fort Boise Military cemetery of Civil War veterans' graves and headstones. On its website, you can read about reports of the cemetery haunted by spirits that roam the area. Apparently, those spirits have found their way to the State's Capitol where the American Redoubt's Second Civil War pits those clear-eyed and proud about the diversity of America against Idaho Republicans who bow in reverence to those who seek a White Redoubt.\n\nWhich shall it be for Idaho's future? The answer is ours to complete.\n\nBob Kustra served as president of Boise State University from 2003 to 2018. He is host of Readers Corner on Boise State Public Radio and is a regular columnist for the Idaho Statesman. He served two terms as Illinois lieutenant governor and 10 years as a state legislator."

      "text": "Republicans need better race bait\n\nManage your account\n\nOPINION: Why can't the GOP find someone who is widely embraced by Black America when they want someone to represent conservative values?\n\nEditor's note: The following article is an op-ed, and the views expressed are the author's own. Read more opinions on theGrio.\n\nThirty years ago, a newspaper published an attack on my character that haunts me to this day. Although it started as an innocent misunderstanding, it has blossomed into a cruel joke that my college friends continue to perpetuate. For nearly three decades, I have battled this disgusting lie but now it is time for me to clear up this misconception.\n\nI like fried chicken.\n\nWatermelon is delicious.\n\nIt all began during my senior year in college after Black students confronted the administration about the school's lack of inclusion. To prove its commitment to cultural diversity, Auburn University Food Services rolled out its Black History Month menu - a selection of handpicked negro cuisine featuring ham hocks, collard greens and, yes, fried chicken every day.\n\n\"When I first saw this menu, I, as well as other students, thought it was a cruel joke,\" I wrote in the school newspaper. \"This menu offers every stereotypical 'nigger dish' except watermelon. Maybe the director of Food Services thought we would beat the doors down to get to some ham hocks and fried chicken, but here's a news flash: Black people actually eat the same food as you do!\"\n\nAs someone who was born and raised in South Carolina, I have a documented history championing deep-fried fowl. But since then, \"Mike hates fried chicken\" has been a running joke among my college friends. In fairness to those who turned this vicious rumor into an inside joke, my use of the n-word may have contributed to the misconception that I have a grudge against deep-fried fowl. While nothing could be further from the truth, I blame the person who chose this headline:\n\nContrary to what the headline professed, I am rarely \"offended.\"  In fact, not only did I think the menu was hilarious, but the campus-wide jigaboo food program proved the Black students' point about the administration's lack of cultural awareness. The tone-deaf attempt at placating Black students with distilled water-boiled collard greens was exactly what a racist institution would do if it didn't actually care about Black people.\n\nThis is a story about Lawrence Taylor.\n\nI like Lawrence Taylor. I didn't find his appearance at Donald Trump's New Jersey campaign stop to stump for the presumptive Republican nominee for president to be shocking. I must confess that I have never spent fewer than zero seconds wondering about Taylor's political beliefs, but I still wasn't surprised when L.T. assured the crowd at the gathering of the MAGA-heauxs that they don't \"have to worry about nobody in my family voting for a Democrat again.\" Taylor also proves Black people's opinion of Donald Trump and the Republican Party. Anyone who knows the facts (and Taylor's documented history of championing crack cocaine ), could never be offended by L.T.'s endorsement of Trump. He is Republican fried chicken. He is \"race bait.\"\n\nWhile \"race-baiting\" is usually reserved as a pejorative to hurl at anyone who dares to mention America's national pastime (white supremacy), the term more accurately describes the GOP's approach to politics. After years of rejecting the core conservative principles of small government, fiscal conservatism and Christian family values, Republicans baited their base into embracing a criminally corrupt, big-spending authoritarian who has no values.\n\nAccording to Pew Research , most Black Protestants, Hispanic Catholics and Asian Christians do not vote Republican. Most Buddhists, Catholics, Jews, Hindus, Muslims and Jehovah's Witnesses do not support the Republican Party. Most college-educated people don't vote Republican. Low-income earners don't typically vote Republican but neither do high-income earners. As you can see, the GOP is not a Christian party. The so-called \"religious right\" does not exist. It has no basis in religion, education or income. Yes, white people are a race and the Republican Party is their party.\n\nUnfortunately, the only thing white people detest more than being referred to as \"white people\" is when other people \"make everything about race.\" So, to protect its Caucasian constituents from the widely accepted, evidence-backed accusations of being, the party of white people routinely recruits skilled negro mouthpieces to echo their counterarguments.\n\nThat's why I am not offended by Candace Owens. I think Jason Whitlock is hilarious. As someone who was born and raised in South Carolina, I have a documented history of dealing with negro conservatives like Stephen A. Smith. In fact, not only did I think Coleman Hughes' new book, \"The End of Race Politics: Arguments for a Colorblind America\" was hilarious, but it proves Black people's point about white supremacy. His tone-deaf attempt at placating white supremacy is exactly what someone would write if they believed people who \"don't see color\" actually cared about Black people. To me, these people are as \"offensive\" as fried chicken and watermelon.\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable thing about this cohort of Caucasian regurgitators is their rareness. Of all the heralded Black economists that have ever existed, when confronted about the economic impact of inequality, conservatives are contractually obligated to bring up Thomas Sowell - not because of his fame or his scholarship (even white economists generally consider Sowell's work to be a \" pseudo-scholarly sham \") - but because Sowell is the \" go-to Black academic for conservative media outlets \" (unless you count the laughable Roland Fryer ).\n\nSimilarly, if Black voters were flocking to Trump as much as the New York Times and cable news pundits want us to believe, where are they hiding all the on-camera interviews with Black Trump supporters? Even if a famous Black athlete could lure Black NFL fans to the Republican Party, why couldn't they find better bait? Is a cocaine enthusiast who played football during my watermelon-hating days the best they could do?\n\nWhen Black Twitter took issue with Stephen A. Smith's political punditry on Sean Hannity's show, it wasn't Smith's political leanings that caused concern. Every Black person has a conservative loud-talking, know-it-all uncle with a hairline like Stephen A Smith's. Even Smith's friendship with Sean Hannity isn't offensive; it's easy to understand why Smith would want to chop it up with anti-Black homey Hannity. However, it is notable that one of the longest-running, most popular shows on cable TV had to get a dude who yells about sports for a living to dissect Black politics. Then again, I'm old enough to remember when Stephen A. Smith warned his colleague Jemele Hill about disparaging a sitting president. To be fair, that was long before this pseudo-psychologist and political pundit Smith offered his opinion on Joe Biden's cognitive abilities.\n\nThe uncle conundrum\n\nThe myth of Stacey Abrams' Black male voting problem\n\nHow a Black conservative activist arranged Donald Trump's stop at an Atlanta Chick-fil-A\n\nWhat Black voters should know 6 months before Election Day\n\nStephen A. Smith's non-apology for his comments on 'Hannity' about Trump and Black people did not help\n\nTo be fair, luring Black voters to the conservative side of the aisle is not the main duty of race-baiters. They are nothing more than puppets sitting on the lap of conservative ventriloquists who pull their dark-skinned dummies out when they need a Black face to affirm the tenets of whiteness. Even white conservatives don't respect these Black MAGA-boos or consider them to be particularly smart. They know Candace Owens has no education, experience or expertise in politics or ... well ... anything. Jason Whitlock is a joke to Black people and white people. Negro-contrarians like Taylor, Smith, Owens, et. al., are equally absurd to Black people who know things as they are to their white conservative counterparts. At most, they are \"articulate,\" which explains why right-leaning Black people are never asked to dissect the behavior of NASCAR dads, soccer moms, evangelical Christians or any of the numerous euphemisms used to describe white voters.\n\nColeman Hughes' entire schtick is to stop people from saying stuff that white people don't like to hear. He joined the Manhattan Institute to focus on \"race, public policy, and applied ethics,\"  just before his fellow Manhattan Institute Fellow Christopher Rufo launched a campaign to redefine critical race theory. Hughes is known for his views on reparations, DEI, anti-racism and more, but his perspective is neither unique nor interesting. Admittedly Hughes does write well (for a Black guy). His most recent book (which I hate-read) is just a factory-refurbished collection of the same strawman arguments white conservatives have used for years. But Coleman Hughes is Black, so this book is different.\n\nIt's bait for racists.\n\nInterestingly, Hughes does not describe himself as conservative. Stephen A. Smith has never said he was a Republican. If I could stomach listening to Whitlock or Owens long enough to divine their political affiliation, they probably wouldn't align themselves with the GOP. I actually agree with their self-assessment. A true conservative wouldn't want the government interfering in women's reproductive choices. Evangelical Christians would never support a presidential candidate who publicly brags about breaking every one of the 10 Commandments. Right-leaning traditionalists supposedly believe in a literal interpretation of history and the Constitution. Today's conservative Republicans don't believe in any of that.\n\nTheir only affiliation is to their whiteness.\n\nI have no idea if Lawrence Taylor is conservative or not, but he is a typical Black Republican. He knows as much about domestic policy as Candace Owens, and that's what they want. I've heard more Black men advocate for Bill Cosby than Donald Trump. The only party with less respect than the Republican Party in Black America is Diddy's shindigs. And why can the GOP only find shape-up-averse Black men or sisters with the most unruly baby hair? When will Black conservatives make their edges great again?\n\nIf the Republican Party actually wanted more Black people to join their ranks, they could probably find a single universally respected Black person to speak on their behalf. But that person would probably believe in something. The Black voices who echo the conservative sentiments don't actually believe in the tenets they express. Jason Whitlock doesn't believe it's \" satanic \" to refer to an insurrectionist as \"an insurrectionist.\" Coleman Hughes (or anyone who's ever read a history book) doesn't actually think pretending to not see differences in culture, history and skin color will make white supremacy vanish into thin air. And no, Lawrence Taylor wouldn't disown a family member who voted for Joe Biden. They care as much about the specific principles of conservatism as Herschel \"the Babydaddy\" Walker cares about \"family values.\" They believe in whiteness. And just like nasty rumors about my disdain for watermelon that were probably spread by the corporate cantaloupe lobbyists, a Black person publicly validating the supremacy of whiteness proves white people's point. It's exactly what someone would say if they didn't care about Black people.\n\nRacists always take the bait.\n\nA few years ago, while recording an audiobook, I ran into a very distraught Black man sitting silently in the kitchen of the studio. The sound engineer introduced him as a very respected voice actor. I didn't want to disturb his peace, but when I smiled and said hello, he began recounting the terrible book he was voicing. According to him, he was halfway through a weeklong session of a book filled with every bad-faith argument about Black people you could imagine.

Log in to hide ads .\n\nThe past year has heightened revelations and discussions about race and white privilege in the U.S. - yet many white Americans  remain reluctant to have those conversations, or struggle to talk about race-related issues.\n\nLoading...\n\nMarch 26, 2021, 12:18 p.m. ET\n\nJohn Bost seems precisely the kind of person that his fellow Americans could have a conversation with - politically moderate, neither an Obama voter nor a Trump one, willing to engage with those both more liberal and more conservative than he is, the former mayor of the North Carolina town where he has lived for more than a quarter century.\n\nTrouble is, when it comes to talking about race with other white people, when it comes to that conversation, the talks he tries to have often lead to the exact same place: absolutely nowhere.\n\n\"They try to compliment you. But I read between the lines. They say, 'You're a deep thinker,'\" Mr. Bost, of Clemmons, North Carolina, says, laughing. \"After a while, they just don't show up as much.\"\n\nThe conversation. The one about race. The one about whiteness and what it means in a multiracial society that is 150 years out of slavery but still reverberating with racial horror. The 21st-century conversation that seems more relevant than ever, yet the one many white people simply don't have, or don't want to have.\n\nAs pervasive and perpetual a subject as race is and has been in the United States - a reality that revealed itself even more starkly over the past year - the conversation about it has been a lopsided one. Most of the talking, protesting, and calling for change has come from people of color.\n\n\"We have all these other ways to not talk about race and white supremacy and white nationalism,\" says the Rev. Jason Chesnut, a minister in Vancouver, Washington, who is white.\n\nCall it the \"fish don't know they're in water\" perspective: As the largest, dominant group in the United States, assuming the position of the \"norm,\" white people generally have not identified with having an everyday collective racial identity like Black, Asian American, Native, and Latino communities.\n\nAnd yet, those who research it say, whiteness - and a commitment to it, however conscious - is as present as the air.\n\n\"For a long time, it was very easy for white people to sort of ignore race, because they could take their racial group for granted, and especially in an environment where they didn't perceive a lot of threats to their group and its status,\" said Ashley Jardina, an assistant professor of political science at Duke University who researches white identity politics.\n\nS. Michael Gaddis, an assistant professor of sociology at UCLA, says research shows that for many white people, \"their views on race are still in an era where race is something we should not be talking about.\"\n\nThe day of the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol in January proved an apt case study for looking at this issue.\n\nThe racial makeup of the Jan. 6 insurrection was hard to miss - a predominantly white crowd of rioters, including some with connections to white nationalist and extremist groups, violently disrupting the certification of the presidential election and running unhindered through the Capitol, a symbol of American democracy.\n\nThe lax policing, a contrast to the strong law enforcement presence seen last summer during protests over the police killings of Black men and women, was swiftly pointed out as a racial double standard, and the presence of current or former military or law enforcement among the rioters sparked concern over extremism in military ranks.\n\nBut the entire crowd wasn't law enforcement, or flag-waving extremist militia. Far from it. They were also regular, everyday white people - small business owners, students, employees - who were ready to overturn an election because they thought their candidate needed to stay in office.\n\nThat's something white Americans must wrestle with, as Mr. Chesnut sees it. Trouble is, he's not particularly optimistic, based on his experience doing anti-racist work. Most white people he meets are surprised that a white man would even talk about race as much as he does.\n\n\"I don't know if white people have learned how to be in a multiracial democracy,\" Mr. Chesnut says. \"White supremacy is destroying us, too, and I don't think we talk enough about that.\"\n\nOr about much having to do with whiteness. In 2019, a Pew Research Center survey found that just 15% of white people considered being white either extremely or very important to how they think about themselves. That compares to 74% of Black people, 59% of Hispanic people, and 56% of Asian people. The number of white people who considered their race extremely important to their self-image was just 5%.\n\nLaurissa Steadman, a conservative and a Trump supporter, says it's easier for white Americans who are liberal to speak about their politics than it is for white conservatives. She says white conservatives like her are often accused of being racist.\n\nMs. Steadman, from California's San Francisco Bay Area, doesn't see race in what happened at the Capitol. She says it was an expression of political frustration, and that the supremacist presence was a small fringe that does not represent conservatives.\n\nBut she acknowledges the criticism that white conservatives face by not being willing to have a conversation about race.\n\n\"I believe there will be assumptions made about them, and their voices will not be heard and the assumptions will be the narrative,\" she says.\n\nHigh-profile events driven by racists also impede conversation. When white Americans have emphasized their racial identity in ways viewed as threatening - such as during the Capitol insurrection or the 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia - it makes white people in general more reluctant to acknowledge white as their racial identifier, Ms. Jardina says.\n\n\"The more we associate people storming the Capitol and waving Confederate flags with white identity and white supremacy, with a capital W and a capital S, the more we'll find that many white Americans are going to back away from this,\" she says.\n\nThat avoidance is precisely the problem, says the Rev. Susan Chorley, a Boston-area pastor.\n\n\"This mess has been from the founding of this country. This mess has been in our soil. It's in our soul,\" Ms. Chorley says. \"It's everywhere, and we've never really completely decided that we will look at it.\"\n\nIf white people want the future to be different, she says, they have to be willing to look at the past and the present - and talk about it as if the nation depended upon it. Which, many say, it does.\n\n\"I think it's on us,\" Ms. Chorley says. \"We as white people need to be gathering up our white people.\"\n\nBut getting white Americans to genuinely wrestle with these issues, Ms. Jardina says, will be a struggle.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

That's become a contentious question for communities as more schools have incorporated into curriculum the idea that residual racism continues to shape modern America. In many states, the debate has shifted from schools to legislatures, as education writer Chelsea Sheasley explored earlier this month .\n\nBoth sides bring distinct worldviews to the discussion, and even defining terms such as \"systemic racism\" has become a stumbling block.\n\nFor Andrew Gutmann, a New York parent, \"Systemic racism, properly understood, is segregated schools and separate lunch counters,\" he wrote in a letter to parents at the elite Brearley School that was later published online by former New York Times columnist Bari Weiss. \"We have not had systemic racism against Blacks in this country since the civil rights reforms of the 1960s,\" he added.\n\nTherein lies the rub for Americans on both sides of the debate. While white conservatives acknowledge the historical examples Mr. Gutmann listed, they prefer to focus on the progress made and chafe at the notion that systemic or institutional racism undergirds American institutions today. To them, the words systemic and institutional imply an overt and intentional effort to enact policies that discriminate based on race.\n\nBut to Boston-area teacher Jo Persad, systemic racism is \"this ever-present force, kind of like gravity. You can't see it but you can experience its effects,\" she told \"Today.\" \"It 'holds' the world together.\"\n\nFrom this vantage point, racism remains systemic, despite the abolition of overtly racist policies. Redlining practices relegating people of color to less desirable neighborhoods, for instance, have largely been repealed. But a 2018 study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition found that 74% of redlined communities of the 1930s remain low-to-moderate income today. \"It's as if some of these places have been trapped in the past, locking neighborhoods into concentrated poverty,\" Jason Richardson of NCRC told The Washington Post.\n\nIronically, most everyone would agree that opportunity is a right, regardless of race. For many conservatives, however, erasing discriminatory laws leveled the playing field enough that progress becomes a matter of individual agency. The other camp cares deeply about agency, too. But for them, the ongoing impact of those laws has stymied advancement uniformly enough that the lack of progress must be addressed as a systemic problem, not individuals' failure.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

His comments on race have been both eloquent - for example, the Philadelphia \"race\" speech during the 2008 primary season - and awkward , as in last year's episode in which he said that Cambridge, Mass. , police \"acted stupidly\" in arresting his friend, Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr.\n\n\"Obama's liberal supporters have made a big deal about him becoming the first black president, and his detractors have made a big deal about him supposedly practicing reverse discrimination,\" says political historian Jason Sokol . \"He's always been in a difficult spot.\"\n\nBut at least some black scholars hold Obama accountable for raising the racial stakes.\n\nCarol Swain , a law professor and race expert at Vanderbilt University in Nashville , Tenn. , raises several examples, including the Gates affair and Sonia Sotomayor 's appointment to the Supreme Court . In these examples, she says, \"it seems like Obama has made race more salient in a negative sort of way that will make white people feel like they're not represented.\"\n\nThe poll findings come on the heels of several high-profile racial flash points this summer and ahead of midterm elections that will determine the balance of power in Washington . Thirty-two percent of Republicans say race relations have worsened (and 8 percent say they've improved), while 37 percent of Democrats say they're better (16 percent say they're worse).\n\nSome liberal groups, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) , have publicly chided one of Obama's main opposition groups, the \"tea party\" movement, for allegedly harboring racists.\n\nConservatives have fired back, saying that what experts call \"nonfalsifiable claims of racism\" - i.e., using the race card - has become an irrelevant tactic in the eyes of most Americans.\n\nThe Monitor/TIPP poll findings don't surprise Gerard Alexander , a political scientist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville .\n\nThe divisions in race attitudes, says Professor Alexander, goes back to the birth of the modern conservative movement in the 1950s and to the perception by many liberals that the right's ideas are mean-spirited and intellectually corrupt. With a black president in office and conservatives staging a challenge to his policies, the divides in perceptions have flared up in earnest.\n\nOne newsy example: Indian-born author Dinesh D'Souza 's recent Forbes story about Obama entitled, \"How he thinks.\" Mr. D'Souza proposed that Obama's estranged Kenyan father inspired the president to adopt \"the cause of anticolonialism.\"\n\nThe Columbia Journalism Review called D'Souza's article \"the worst kind of smear journalism - a singularly disgusting work.\"\n\nGiven such reactions, many conservatives feel it's better not to speak their piece at all. \"When conservatives want to chip into conversations - race being the most obvious one - they find themselves getting their heads bitten off,\" Alexander says.\n\nBut if mostly white conservatives are feeling put upon by the current tenor of the race debate, they are joined by blacks - 26 percent of whom said race relations have gotten worse under Obama (versus 22 percent who said they felt it's better).\n\n(Hispanics felt differently, with 36 percent saying race relations are better and 22 percent saying they're worse. White men are nearly evenly split on the question, with 21 percent believing relations are worse and 20 percent believing things are better.)\n\nBlacks, too, are reacting to the \"racialized\" political and cultural battles - but from a vastly different vantage point.\n\nThe tea-party insurgency has demoralized many African-Americans, especially after hotly contested allegations earlier this year that a group of tea partyers shouted racial epithets to a group of black politicians near the Capitol, says William Boone , a political science professor at historically black Clark Atlanta University .\n\nFor blacks, \"some of the things these folks are supporting would be interpreted as being antiblack or detrimental to black progress,\" even though many blacks share some of the same conservative values politically, says Professor Boone.\n\nHe adds, \"Black folk in general indicate that a lot of hits [Obama] has taken is solely because he's black. Whether that's factual or not, that's the perception.\"\n\nBy region in the poll, New England and the West offered the starkest contrast on perceptions of race relations: Twenty-seven percent of New Englanders said relations have improved, while 26 percent of Westerners said relations have worsened. Within one region, the disparity in beliefs was largest in the South: Twenty-four percent of respondents said Obama has worsened race relations, and 16 percent said the president has helped calm racial tensions.\n\nThe poll of 908 US adults took place between Sept. 9 and 12. The poll has a 3.3 percent margin of error.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Login\n\nMonitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in.

Again and again, she experienced moments in churches she served that nearly shattered her faith altogether.\n\nWhat do you do when your house of worship no longer welcomes you, but your faith remains a cornerstone of your life? The Post-Evangelical Collective is charting a new path.\n\nBut Ms. Ladouceur says her relationship with Jesus carried her through. Though she has disassociated herself from a movement now intimately enmeshed with Republican politics, she and others have embraced an enigmatic new label. She formally identifies herself today as \"post-Evangelical.\"\n\nThere's an ambivalence embedded in this identity, even if she and others are just beginning to figure out what it means beyond deconstructing white evangelicalism's fusion of faith and right-wing politics.\n\nThere are, of course, plenty of choices in America's robust array of Christian traditions, including those that have long traveled more progressive theological paths. There is also the fastest-growing religious group in the United States, \"the nones,\" who may have spiritual beliefs but no longer identify themselves as adherents of an organized religion.\n\nMs. Ladouceur and her fellow post-Evangelicals say they want to hold on to the faith they've lived, even though they reject - or have been rejected by - their former churches.\n\nThere are reasons to keep the term they use to describe themselves, even if they are decisively putting traditional evangelicalism in their pasts.\n\n\"I just find the person of Jesus and story after story of liberation and healing and redemption just a really compelling depiction of who God is,\" says Ms. Ladouceur, now the co-founder and executive director of the Post-Evangelical Collective, a small but growing consortium of congregations of former Evangelicals. \"It's just something that I still want to try to align my life with.\"\n\nShe still testifies, too, to the dramatic personal encounter with Jesus that compelled her to change her life almost 20 years ago. Though she no longer uses the expression, her spiritual experience of being \"born again\" still defines who she is.\n\nTwo decades ago, white Evangelicals comprised over a quarter of the U.S. population. This number has since dropped to about 15%, according to a 2021 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute.\n\nThere's a certain irony in this decline. For decades, the religiously conservative movement flourished in the U.S. as more liberal Protestant traditions lost members. Raw, real, and literal, evangelical Christianity engaged the human heart in ways a more intellectual Christianity never could, many believers explained.\n\nThese religious characteristics describe a significant section of Black and Latino Protestantism, too. Since the 1970s, however, the term has mostly applied to white conservatives who coalesced around the candidacy of Ronald Reagan, becoming the most reliable and politically potent force in American politics, and the core of the Republican Party.\n\nA wide majority of white Evangelicals continue to proclaim a zealous enthusiasm for former President Donald Trump - and they feel their support has been vindicated. Last year, in a resounding victory after a half-century of effort, a Supreme Court with three members appointed by President Trump overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\nThe nation's high court, with a supermajority of justices who have conservative religious commitments, also opened the doors for taxpayer support for religious education, another top-line goal for Evangelicals. Similarly, the justices have made protecting religious liberty a paramount concern in cases brought by religious conservatives.\n\nAs white evangelicalism now stands at the peak of its political power, however, many are beginning to confront the movement's own internal decline.\n\n\"More people have left the church in the last twenty-five years than all the new people who became Christians from the First Great Awakening, Second Great Awakening, and Billy Graham crusades combined,\" write Evangelical pastors Jim Davis and Michael Graham in their book, \"The Great Dechurching.\"\n\nWhile they suggest a nuanced picture of the decline of Evangelicals, it's clear that politics is driving a significant part of younger generations away, surveys show.\n\n\"The No. 1 question that younger Evangelicals ask me is how to relate to their parents and mentors who want to talk about culture-war politics and internet conspiracy theories instead of prayer or the Bible,\" writes Russell Moore, former head of the ethics committee of the Southern Baptist Convention. He felt forced to leave the denomination because of his outspoken opposition to Mr. Trump. \"Almost none of them even call themselves 'evangelical' anymore, now that the label is confused with political categories.\"\n\nThe nation's bitter political divisions have played a significant role in the fledgling movement of post-Evangelicals, who also emphasize their more progressive concerns as they try to reforge their understanding of Christian faith.\n\n\"What they're leaving behind is anti-intellectualism; they're leaving behind anti-LGBT commitments; they're trying to leave behind patriarchy,\" says David Gushee, professor of Christian ethics at Mercer University in Atlanta. \"They're trying to leave behind nationalism and militarism, because they believe that doesn't really fit with following Jesus - in any country. And they're definitely trying to leave behind the identification of conservative whiteness as synonymous with following Jesus.\"\n\nOnce considered a preeminent Evangelical ethicist, Mr. Gushee wrote \"Changing Our Mind\" in 2014. His book appealed to biblical authority and traditional Christian theology to argue for the full inclusion of same-sex couples and transgender people. In many ways, his book remained conservative, in that it invited LGBTQ+ people into the tradition of Christian marriage, reserving sexual expression within monogamous lifelong commitments.\n\nMr. Gushee was used to being outside his culture's conservative views, and he had always been comfortable calling himself a \"progressive Evangelical.\" But in this era of amplified polarization, former friends, colleagues, and students thought he had moved into a place that was both dangerous and wicked.\n\n\"More and more Evangelicals have the idea that the people who disagree with us - the people who gave us Roe v. Wade, the people who gave us the gay rights movement, or that progressives and Democrats in general - they're not just wrong, they're not just our respective opponents; they are demonic enemies of all that is good,\" he says.\n\nAfter 40 years as a committed Evangelical scholar, Mr. Gushee says that journey has ended. The time has now come to forge ahead and build something new with those that he says are \"following Jesus out of American evangelicalism.\"\n\nMs. Ladouceur still vividly remembers the moment Jesus came into her life on Easter Sunday in 2005.\n\nShe was driving home late, as usual, from one of the restaurants where she worked in Tampa, Florida. She was 20 and still thrilled with her cute new car with leather seats and a sunroof.\n\nShe had gotten her GED diploma a few years earlier and had become a regional manager for a restaurant group, in charge of employee training at an age when most people are still in college. She was working long hours and making bank, spending weekends on boats with friends, attending parties, and dating a lot.\n\n\"I tried everything the world had to offer me that I thought was going to make me feel whole or fulfilled,\" Ms. Ladouceur says. \"But it all kind of came up empty.\"\n\nThat night, she took notice of the sign in front of the sprawling evangelical church next to her restaurant, announcing its Easter service. She'd passed the campus probably hundreds of times, says Ms. Ladouceur. \"I just felt a sort of a whispered invitation,\" she says.\n\nThe next morning it was a bit strange, she says, being a single 20-year-old walking into a large church with lots of families. Four years earlier, she had legally emancipated herself from her own religious family. She describes leaving behind a household of addiction, abuse, and adultery, vowing she wanted nothing to do with religion as she set out to live alone at 16.\n\nBut she was drawn to the church's high-tech worship, fun lobby photo booths, and focus on family services. \"I suddenly felt this connection to a spirit of, 'Yes, I do think this is part of what has been lacking in my life,'\" she says.\n\nShe was gripped by the 30-minute sermon of a pastor she found \"earnest and real and compassionate\" as he talked about the struggles of living a Christian life. When she went home, she wrote a verse from the sermon on a sticky note and posted it on her mirror, where she could see these words of Jesus every day:\n\n\"Whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.\"\n\nShe felt reborn. It was a moment that changed her life. She began to see her work as a chance to build teams rooted in respect and kindness. Within weeks, she instituted a Building Better People policy for her restaurants' training program.\n\n\"Every day, it was like, what do I have to do to lose my life but find my life in Christ before showing up to work to a managers meeting? How am I going to lead these managers? How am I going to talk about our cultural issues within our organization? What should I do with my money?\" Ms. Ladouceur. \"Yeah, it was just, what do I need to do to lose my life and what do I need to do to find my way to Jesus?\"\n\nShe began to volunteer with the youth ministries. Within a year, the senior pastor asked the enthusiastic young member: You've been building restaurants and scaling a franchise. I wonder if you've ever considered building ministries?\n\nIt would mean taking a 70% pay cut. It would mean changing her lifestyle. That week she sat down and wrote pages and pages of ideas for leading a ministry for middle schoolers. It was, as she would later say, \"a clear calling.\"\n\nShe accepted the job, and the church gave her a modest salary and a new title: pastor of youth ministries.\n\nBut there were warning signs, even back then. The first came relatively soon, when her congregation called a new pastor of discipleship. He wouldn't take the job they offered him if women were able to hold the title of pastor. Her gender should use their gifts to complement the proper spiritual headship of men, he believed.\n\nSo church leaders changed their young minister's title from pastor to coordinator of youth ministries.\n\nAmerican evangelical Protestantism has long been forged in cultural conflict.\n\nIn many ways, it emerged from what were called the \"modernist\" controversies of the early 20th century. Historical and critical studies of the Bible and the theory of evolution challenged literalist interpretations. Many Protestant denominations adjusted their understanding of faith and miracles within a very different understanding of the cosmos and the physical world.\n\nIn response, conservatives issued a statement that became known as \"the five fundamentals,\" which insisted on nonnegotiable beliefs such as the virgin birth, the literal resurrection of Jesus, and the infallibility of the Bible. The Scopes Trial in 1925 brought these controversies to a crescendo in a well-publicized clash over the teaching of evolution in public schools.\n\nFor decades after that cultural defeat, fundamentalist Christianity mostly retreated from public life, quietly building new institutions and denominational infrastructures. The term \"fundamentalist\" became a mostly pejorative label.\n\nBy the 1950s, many conservative Christians started to distance themselves from fundamentalism, at least in a cultural sense. The Evangelist Billy Graham brought a more middle-class and business-friendly sensibility, wearing a suit and tie during his revivals. He used radio and television to share a less reactionary religious message, even if he still decried the country's liberal direction and called for a return to its perceived authentic past.\n\n\"The modern American evangelical movement born in those years always had a kind of a 'Take America back for God,' and 'Take the world back for Christ' kind of vision,\" says Mr. Gushee. \"I mean, that's just in the marrow of evangelicalism.\n\n\"The strategy was, you tell all your neighbors about Jesus and then you bring them to church,\" he says. \"And then you send missionaries all over, all around the world. It was, 'win the world for Christ.'\"\n\nBy the end of the 1970s, this cultural reemergence included political organizing, especially in support of Ronald Reagan. \"But I now think that that strategy partly reflected a loss of confidence in the strategy of evangelism and missions,\" Mr. Gushee says.\n\nAbortion and sexuality played little role in the political organizing of white Evangelicals in the 1970s, historians such as Randall Balmer at Dartmouth College point out. The galvanizing political issue, he argues, was the desegregation of public schools and the needs of the private, mostly white Christian academies that sprang up in response.\n\nMr. Gushee's book \"Defending Democracy From Its Christian Enemies\" traces how evangelical politics has evolved. Today, its targets include critical race theory and books about race and LGBTQ+ people, drag shows, and abortion and transgender health care.\n\n\"Christian nationalism is not my preferred term to describe the politics that has emerged,\" Mr. Gushee says. \"I call it authoritarian, reactionary Christian politics that increasingly doesn't trust the democratic process.\"\n\nIn truth, Zach Lambert has always been something of a rebel.\n\nHe grew up in Austin, Texas, as part of a family long steeped in evangelicalism. His grandparents were charter members of Great Hills Baptist Church, which flourished over the decades to become Austin's first megachurch. His father, Reagan Lambert, was hired by legendary Dallas Cowboys Coach Tom Landry to open a chapter of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which he ran for 30 years.\n\nDespite such a pedigree, Mr. Lambert bristled at some of the ideas about God he was learning at his family church. Confident and aggressive, he sometimes liked to challenge the youth minister on matters of theology during youth group discussions.\n\nOne Easter week, the youth minister was explaining the theology of atonement, Mr. Lambert recalls. When Jesus was on the cross, God turned his back on him, the minister said, because Jesus had all of our sins on him. God in his perfect holiness can't abide sin in his presence, so that's why Jesus said, \"Father, Father, why have you forsaken me?\"\n\n\"So, I raised my hand and said something to the effect of, 'You tell us that this God is a good father and he is trustworthy and he loves us,'\" he says. \"And yet, it sounds like at the greatest time of need, he turns his back and is nowhere to be found. How does it work, anyway, that God can't be around sin, which means, what? That he can't be around the world or any of us at any time?\"\n\nThe youth minister had enough. Rather than try to explain one of theology's harder problems, he kicked the smart aleck out of the group. Far from chastened, Mr. Lambert was happy to go.\n\nLike many teenagers in Texas, he was obsessed with video games and football, giving little thought to religion. He became a member of his high school's varsity football team, which had the Rebels as a mascot. Like many teammates, he hung a Confederate battle flag above his bed.\n\nBut then a moment changed him. He reconnected with a friend he'd known from kindergarten through middle school. They had lost contact after each went to high schools on different sides of Austin. Excited to see him, Mr. Lambert invited him to hang out and play video games.\n\nAt the door of his bedroom, however, his friend froze, suddenly saying he had to leave. Confused, he asked why. His friend explained that his parents had told him that if he ever found himself with white people displaying that flag, he should leave as quickly as possible. Mr. Lambert was stunned; he had no idea his flag could cause such a reaction. He took the flag down and never put it back up.\n\nWhen Mr. Lambert was 17, he was still something of a rebel, smoking weed and drinking. One summer evening when he was out late with friends, he overdosed on a combination of cough medicine and alcohol, needing medical attention. Not long after that, an acquaintance also overdosed, then died.\n\nThe experiences were devastating. \"I started to ask those existential questions, like, why am I here? And is God real, and have I misunderstood Christianity? Do I need to reengage with it to find meaning in my life?\" he says. He started reading the Bible again. Then, at a youth camp, he had a powerful conversion experience.\n\nHe'd always planned to attend a Christian college in Texas and play football. His plan was to study sports management and start a career as a football coach. But during his first year at college, he found a small evangelical congregation and became an active member.\n\nA devastating injury meant he could no longer play football. But his church asked him to be their part-time youth pastor. Soon there was no doubt in his mind: His true calling was to be a full-time Christian pastor.\n\nAfter graduating, he went to Dallas Theological Seminary. He also landed a pastoral internship at Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, one of the largest megachurches in the U.S. During the Obama years, he worked closely with Jack Graham, who would later become a member of the evangelical advisory committee to President Trump.\n\n\"Politics, it was all very integral to what the church did,\" says Mr. Lambert. \"A church that was supposed to be doing God's work was so enmeshed with right-wing politicians and political figures. ... So, yeah, I just got really disillusioned really quickly.\"\n\nAnd then there were the scandals. According to the 2022 Guidepost report on sexual abuse within Southern Baptist Convention, Dr. Graham, a former president of the convention, \"allegedly allowed an accused abuser of young boys to be dismissed quietly in 1989 without reporting the abuse to police.\" The former music minister moved on to a congregation in Mississippi, where he was charged with abusing young boys, the report says.\n\nIn May 2008, another pastor at Prestonwood was arrested for soliciting sex from a police officer posing as a 13-year-old girl online. A few years later, Mr. Lambert says a pastor on staff became addicted to painkillers and, during pastoral calls to older adults, stole their medications. Church leaders accused the pastor's wife of neglecting her appearance, gaining weight, and contributing to her husband's addiction.\n\n\"I kind of thought, yeah, I'm probably going to be done with ministry,\" he says.\n\nLooking back, Ms. Ladouceur always felt a bit uneasy with the \"purity culture\" that seemed to fall mostly on women. She had lost the title of pastor, but she was still dedicated to her ministry, working with middle school children.\n\nAnother youth pastor started to pursue her romantically. \"I actually said to him, 'You'll probably get fired for hanging out with me. Like, this is never going to be a thing,'\" she recalls joking. But they started dating, and church leaders made it clear: They should marry as soon as possible, especially since he was planning to go to seminary. So they did.\n\nPart of her new husband's training included a position near Chicago at a renowned megachurch, Willow Creek Community Church. Its founder and senior pastor, Bill Hybels, was recognized as one of the most important Evangelical ministers in the country. Politically moderate and focused on evangelism and ministry, he worked with President Barack Obama on immigration issues. Unlike other conservative ministers, he supported women having the role of pastor.\n\nLeaders at Willow Creek, impressed with her experience, also offered Ms. Ladouceur a full time job as a youth minister.\n\nFor over a decade, it was a good life. The young, energetic ministers started a family, having a daughter and son. \"While I worked in student ministry, I ran a winter camp for 2,000 high school students while I was nine months pregnant\" with her daughter, Olivia, she says. \"It was a wild time.\"\n\nShe moved on to other ministerial roles, including a peacemaking ministry, which sought to address the conflicts between Israelis and Palestinians. Then, six months pregnant with her son, Liam, she interviewed for an adult education ministry. She got the position, and she began to work closely with Mr. Hybels.\n\nIn 2018 in an international scandal, Mr. Hybels resigned after at least five women told their stories of being groomed and sexually harassed while working closely with him. Ms. Ladouceur was one of those women. Mr. Hybels continues to deny the accusations, including those of Ms. Ladouceur.\n\n\"The way Willow Creek and its leaders responded to me, it was gutting to me,\" Ms. Ladouceur says. \"I just really had to wrestle with, wouldn't Jesus be moving toward the ones who were hurt in this situation, not protecting the organization?\"\n\nHer marriage didn't survive the public ordeal. For a time, she returned to working with racial justice and peacemaking nonprofits, as she struggled to rebuild her life, and her faith.\n\n\"My faith paradigm had been decimated,\" she says. \"But Jesus was still the compelling force behind not wanting to give up my faith in Jesus.\" Deep in therapy, she decided to go to seminary to work through her shattered call to ministry.\n\nA single mother, she became a pastor again in a congregation in Kentucky. But she felt called to do more after her experiences in prominent evangelical churches. She wanted to try to change the paradigms of Christian ministry.\n\nHer faith in Jesus was still calling her to build the kingdom of God, she says. And soon she was finding hundreds of people who felt called to do the same.\n\nAfter leaving Prestonwood, Mr. Lambert decided to remain committed to ministry. In fact, he says he \"really kind of caught the church-planting bug,\" so he moved his family back to Austin and started a church from scratch.\n\nHe and others began to raise funds, and they formed a denominational partnership with the Evangelical Free Church of America.\n\nAt first he felt that his ministry should shun politics. But his church, Restore Austin, was becoming diverse, and it included same-sex couples and others who didn't fit the evangelical profile.\n\n\"Everything started happening in our first year of being a church in 2016, and it wasn't even because of the presidential election,\" Mr. Lambert says. \"At our first baptism service, we baptized a number of LGBTQ+ folks, including a lesbian couple. We gave a kids' dedication service for another lesbian couple who became a part of the church,\" he says. The congregation also started to have discussions about racial justice and Black Lives Matter.\n\nThese actions placed them under investigation by the Evangelical Free denomination and other financial sponsors. His congregation's actions were considered unbiblical and sinful, and his ministry license was revoked.\n\n\"We were kicked out of absolutely every evangelical organization that we were a part of, including our denomination,\" Mr. Lambert says. \"We felt really alone.\"\n\nDuring the pandemic, he says, a miracle happened. As his ministry moved online, he started to connect with other ministers and congregations who had experiences like his.\n\n\"We realized, we needed to figure out how to build some systems and structures into an actual kind of network organization so that we can better support pastors, a lot who have been kicked out of denominations or stripped of ordinations. We all had the same stories,\" he says.\n\nBy 2021, roundtables and meet-ups included hundreds of ministers and others who were starting to call themselves \"post-Evangelicals,\" and who were not ready to abandon their faith or call to ministry.\n\nMs. Ladouceur was among them. Together, they helped forge the Post-Evangelical Collective to support those who were either forced out or decided to walk away. So far, the collective has established \"hubs\" in at least 14 major cities, with about 50 congregations.\n\n\"Evangelicals are driving out their exiles. They are losing their young disproportionately,\" says Mr. Gushee. \"So God-oriented, Christ-following folks are heading into post-evangelical spaces, but it needs to exist institutionally for people to have a place to land,\" he adds. \"That is what is being built right before our eyes. I believe that evangelicalism is definitely shrinking, post-evangelicalism is definitely coalescing - and I believe it will become a significant part of U.S. religion.\"\n\nMr. Lambert no longer thinks his ministry should be apolitical. \"I've just become really convinced that the call to Christ's followers is to leverage whatever power or privilege we have in the service of people who have less,\" Mr. Lambert says, adding he feels a responsibility to use whatever privilege he has \"in a way that helps people rather than harms people.\"\n\nMs. Ladouceur feels much the same: \"I feel way less pressure these days to have all of the right intellectual thoughts about Jesus, and more about just how upside down and subversive his way of being in the world was - a way of being that did not lead to destruction, but led to redemption.\"\n\nThe story of the Syrophoenician woman in the Gospel of Mark has been in her heart, she says. Jesus is trying to get away from the clamoring crowds, and this Gentile woman falls at his feet and begs him to heal her daughter. \"It is not right to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs,\" Jesus retorts. \"Lord,\" the woman replies, \"even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs.\" Impressed, Jesus tells her that her daughter has been healed.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

And who Jesus came to welcome, every time it flipped religious ideals on their heads - even his own. He made a lot of religious people angry by continuing to build a longer table and invite more and more people.\"\n\nIn some ways, the words of Jesus at her conversion were prophetic. \"Whoever wants to save their life will lose it, but whoever loses their life for me will find it.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

It is also making the South more polarized, as both parties lose their forces of moderation.\n\n\"The main realignment in the region is a shift of white conservatives away from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party across the South,\" says Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University in Atlanta. \"Now the vast majority of [Southern] conservatives are Republicans or think of themselves as Republicans.\"\n\nThe trend dates to presidential elections in the 1950s, but it gained momentum in 1980 when many southern Democrats crossed party lines to vote for Ronald Reagan. But while these southern Democrats voted Republican for president, they typically stayed loyal to their party elsewhere on the ballot.\n\nEventually, however, that changed. Many conservative Democrats in the South jumped ship to the GOP, while others called themselves Democrats but began supporting Republican congressional and gubernatorial candidates as well. Most felt Republicans better represented their interests on important issues. They're against affirmative action, for instance, and are typically strong advocates of morality-based issues, such as prayer in school. They want to limit the size of government, keep a strong national defense, and they take a tough stance on crime.\n\nOver time, the trend broadened to include support for state legislative and local candidates.\n\nToday, eight of the 11 governors of traditional southern states are Republicans. Republicans hold roughly 60 percent of Southern seats in Congress.\n\nThe trend is trickling down to the state and local level where it is now changing the composition of state legislatures from Virginia to Florida to Texas.\n\n\"In 1978, the Republicans had 17 percent of the seats [in state legislatures across the south], now they have 40 percent,\" says Hastings Wyman Jr., publisher of the Southern Political Report.\n\n\"Over time the Republican influence has really moved,\" he says. \"Once Republicans started winning, they just won at all levels - and that is continuing.\"\n\nRepublicans control both houses of the Florida Legislature, the Senate in Texas and Virginia, and the House in North Carolina and South Carolina.\n\nRepublican inroads have come at a slower pace at the state legislative level, analysts say, because Southern conservatives have been more willing to support conservative Democratic incumbents in state government. But when those Democratic incumbents step down, they're frequently replaced by Republicans.\n\nPolitical analysts say the Republicans will likely pick up a few seats in November elections, but dramatic shifts aren't anticipated at the congressional or statehouse levels. Nonetheless, there are at least three races that could highlight the GOP's growing political clout across the South.\n\nIf Jeb Bush, son of the former president, becomes governor in Florida and his party retains control of the Legislature in Tallahassee, it would mark the first time in modern history that a Southern state was led by a Republican governor and GOP-controlled legislature.\n\nTexas Gov. George W. Bush, Jeb's older brother, is expected to win reelection and emerge as a possible presidential candidate, strengthening his party's influence.\n\nIf the GOP wins the close governor's race in Georgia, it would mark the first time this century that a Republican resided in the governor's mansion. Georgia primaries haven't been held yet, but an expected race between Republican Guy Millner and Democrat Roy Barnes is seen as too close to call.\n\nCharles Bullock III, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, says the race will offer a gauge on whether conservative white voters are continuing to drift toward the GOP.\n\nIf the trend has stabilized in Georgia and Mr. Barnes or any other Democrat wins 40 percent of the white vote, the Democratic lock on the governorship will remain firm, he says. That's because a Democrat can count on about 95 percent of Georgia's black vote, Mr. Bullock says.\n\nGeorgia isn't the only state with a close race for governor. In Alabama, incumbent Republican Fob James may be in trouble. He has invested much political capital in the prayer-in-school and Ten Commandments-in-court issues, rather than focusing on generating business growth. He faces the prospect of a nasty GOP primary that could leave the Democratic challenger in a position to win in November, analysts say.\n\nOn a regionwide basis, it's unclear to what extent the Republican gains will continue, analysts say. GOP strongholds now exist throughout the South in suburban districts populated by white voters. The Democrats are strong in urban and black rural districts.\n\nSome analysts say future Republican gains will depend on how new election district lines are drawn after the 2000 census.\n\nMany say the momentum is with the GOP. \"I fully expect that over the next 10 or more years we will see state legislatures and local offices shift to where Republicans hold a majority,\" says David Rohde, a political scientist at Michigan State University.\n\nBut, he says, Republicans will never dominate the political scene in the South the way the Democrats did in the past.\n\nThomas Eamon, a political scientist at East Carolina University in Greenville, N.C., agrees. \"The South is just playing catch-up, and it is becoming a two-party system now.\"\n\n\"The realignment of these conservatives is not enough to produce automatic victories for the Republicans,\" says Mr. Black. \"They also have to appeal to moderates.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But conservative critics say a too-broad definition of hate stifles legitimate debate.\n\nLoading...\n\nFeb. 23, 2011, 8:10 p.m. ET | Atlanta\n\nEven as the Southern Poverty Law Center points out that the number of US hate groups has topped 1,000 for the first time , the civil rights organization is receiving flak from critics on the right who say an overbroad definition of \"hate\" vilifies innocent people and stifles vigorous debate about issues critical to America's future.\n\nTension erupted recently between the SPLC and a slew of Republicans , including House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio and Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota (who tops the SPLC's \"militia enablers list\"), who protested the SPLC's listing of the conservative Family Research Council as a hate group. The SPLC said the Family Research Council is knowingly pushing falsehoods about gay people.\n\nThe tension between the SPLC and its critics on the right underscores that \"conflicts in America today are deeper than they were in the 1850s,\" says Donald Livingston , an Emory University philosophy professor and a former member of the pro-secessionist League of the South , which the SPLC today lists as a hate group.\n\nThe Montgomery, Ala. -based SPLC , which became well-known for civil lawsuits that weakened the KKK and other white supremacist groups, is careful to note that organizations on its list don't necessarily advocate violence. Its definition of a hate group and \"ideologues\" includes groups and people who suggest that an entire group of human beings are, by virtue of class characteristics, \"somewhat less,\" says Mark Potok , the editor of the SPLC's Intelligence Report, which published its findings Wednesday.\n\n\"We're not in any way suggesting that these groups should be outlawed or free speech should be suppressed ... but it's a kind of calling out the liars, the demonizers, the propagandists,\" says Mr. Potok. While the groups themselves may not advocate violence, he says, such speech has \"driven people and will continue to drive people to murder.\"\n\nDriven by fears about changing demographics, the first black president, and a harrowing economy, \"[the] three strands of the radical right - the hatemongers, the nativists and the antigovernment zealots - increased from 1,753 groups in 2009 to 2,145 in 2010, a 22% rise,\" the report says. \"That followed a 2008-2009 increase of 40%.\"\n\nNeo-Nazi-like hate groups grew by nearly 10 percent since 2009, to 1002; anti-immigration vigilante groups grew by 3 percent, to 319; and antigovernment \"Patriot\" groups - defined as \"conspiracy-minded organizations that see the federal government as their primary enemy\" - grew by 60 percent, to 824. (See the SPLC's \"hate map\" here .)\n\nPotok notes that the slowdown in the increase of the number of so-called \"nativist\" anti-immigration groups is probably related to the enactment of tough new measures against illegal immigrants, such as in Arizona . But while legislators in states such as Virginia and Montana have proffered a slew of antifederal legislation this year, the mainstreaming of hard-right issues hasn't dramatically \"taken the wind out of the sails\" of Patriot groups, he says.\n\n\"[Despite] historic Republican gains, the early signs suggest that even as the more mainstream political right strengthens, the radical right has remained highly energized,\" the report states.\n\nAs evidence, the report points to an 11-day period in January when \"a neo-Nazi was arrested headed for the Arizona border with a dozen homemade grenades; a terrorist bomb attack on a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade in Spokane , Wash., was averted after police dismantled a sophisticated anti-personnel weapon ; and a man who officials said had a long history of antigovernment activities was arrested outside a packed mosque in Dearborn, Mich. , and charged with possessing explosives with unlawful intent . That's in addition, the same month, to the shooting of US Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona, an attack that left six dead and may have had a political dimension.\"\n\nWhile the SPLC's investigations and studies are used by some law enforcement agencies concerned about domestic terrorism, its overall work, its critics on the right say, has taken on an overtly political dimension by giving ideological cover for attacks primarily on white conservatives and by turning the word \"patriot\" into a euphemism.\n\nIn December, 22 Republican lawmakers, among them Speaker Boehner and Representative Bachmann, three governors, and a number of conservative organizations took out full-page ads in two Washington papers castigating the SPLC for \"character assassination\" by listing the conservative Family Research Council as a hate group.\n\nProfessor Livingston's own run-in with the SPLC is over his previous association with the League of the South, initially a largely academic organization that promoted the notion that the South might have to secede. The SPLC lists him as an \"ideologue\" of the neo-Confederate movement.\n\nAccording to the SPLC, the League of the South today \"is a neo-Confederate group that advocates for a second Southern secession and a society dominated by 'European Americans.' The league believes the 'godly' nation it wants to form should be run by an 'Anglo-Celtic' (read: white) elite that would establish a Christian theocratic state and politically dominate blacks and other minorities.\"\n\nLivingston says he left the League after it became more political in nature, but adds that it is not a hate group.\n\nEmory University, Livingston says, looked into claims in a college newspaper story that used the SPLC's designation to link him to a \"hate group,\" but he was cleared and backed by the university.\n\n\"They really need to explain what they mean by hate and how in the world [Loyola economist Thomas] DiLorenzo or myself could be associated with something called hate,\" says Livingston. \"We don't hate anybody.\"\n\nIn January, Mr. DiLorenzo was called out on the House floor for being a member of the League of the South. Mr. DiLorenzo says he's not a member, but Loyola University in Baltimore is investigating.\n\nLivingston, who describes himself as a former supporter of the SPLC, questions whether the organization's \"hate group\" reports are primarily tied to its fund-raising activities. He also notes that many of those listed by the SPLC take it as a \"badge of honor,\" much as tea party activists took to wearing \"I'm a right-wing extremist\" T-shirts.\n\nNevertheless, he says, \"it's time for some reality check on this sort of thing, beginning with the very concept of hate. The SPLC has a political agenda and they vilify people, that's what they do. There's very little in the way of an empirical examination of groups that might pose a threat to civil order. There's almost nobody left in the Klan, so what they do is they find respectable groups or high-profile people and they say, 'X is linked to Y, who is linked to a hate group.' That's what McCarthy did.\"\n\nThe SPLC's Potok takes the criticisms in stride.\n\n\"We are regularly accused of trying to shut down people's speech rights, of trying to send anyone to prison who is not politically correct,\" Potok says. \"Those criticisms are ludicrous, and they come from people who don't read what we write.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

When the President takes his vacation, the question of who is in charge crops up, as does the quality of his or her judgment. On Aug. 19, 1981, for example, there was the flap over the shooting down of a Libyan aircraft over the Mediterranean, when the President was not awakened and told the news. The following August, Wall Street was jittery as the country labored to come out of the recession, and the White House again felt under attack. The administration came to see that it had to keep up some kind of August news offensive to defend against a seasonal slump when its heavy hitter, the President himself, took time off.\n\nEven with this explanation, this August's offensive has been a patchy affair, with factionalism among aides showing the deep split between conservative and moderate views across the board, and with the conservatives taking the opportunity to push their ideas from within the shadow of the presidential seal.\n\nOn foreign topics, the administration's chief Cabinet spokesman, Secretary of State George P. Shultz, has been taking a break himself higher up the California coast in Palo Alto. The President's national security adviser, Robert C. McFarlane, has done most of the talking on South Africa and the Soviet Union.\n\nWe've been told by White House ``aides'' that the White House sees no prospect of resolving differences with the Nicaragua government as long as the Sandinistas remain in power. We read that US-Cuban ties have again cooled.\n\nThe Soviet Union will have to clean up its act on arms, including defensive systems and chemical weapons, as well as human-rights violations and intrusions into regions not its own, we are told -- a rhetorical brushback at the same moment the administration was announcing a meeting in Washington between the new Soviet foreign minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, and President Reagan on Sept. 27.\n\nA year ago, going into the national election, when the White House emphasis was on its willingness to talk with the Soviet leadership, the conference with Mr. Shevardnadze would have been given greater stress.\n\nOn South Africa, again it is Mr. McFarlane giving the main White House response -- criticizing Bishop Desmond Tutu for not joining in a perfunctory meeting of churchmen with President Pieter W. Botha.\n\nThis was perhaps intended as a show of administration evenhandedness in South Africa. But when taken with the administration's recent stirrings to dump federal fair hiring goals for blacks, women, and Hispanics in the United States, it suggests a consistent insensitivity to the aspirations of anyone but white, dominant-culture males. This is causing a furor within the GOP, as moderates see the party's efforts to create a mainstream political movement, not to mention their convictions about fairness and opportunity, frustrated by the efforts of officials and aides asserting positions they make out to be the President's.\n\nPolitically related is the administration's August effort to woo working-class whites and Southern white conservatives with pronouncements on religion in the schools, the Supreme Court, and school vouchers.\n\nIt is admittedly difficult to respond to a developing story, like South African unrest, when an administration -- and all of Washington -- is operating at less than half strength.\n\nBut the pattern this August suggests the White House apparatus has decided to maintain the President's hard-line positions intact through this vacation period. And it reflects a staff emphasis that may be even more ideologically adventurous than the President's.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "Mandela's Return\n\nBy MS\n\nTHE Nelson Mandela who is about to return to South Africa after his triumphant European and North American tour is a different figure from the man who embarked on that trip some weeks ago. His stature as a leader in the battle against apartheid already was large, but now it towers. In each country he visited Mr. Mandela has been treated, in all ways but strict protocol, like a head of state. He has become a world personage, and his cause has been shown to have strong international support. Mandela's added prestige will carry a lot of weight in further negotiations with Pretoria. In the words of one observer, the South African government now finds itself with a ``Gandhi-like figure to deal with.''\n\nThat could be nettlesome in some respects for the government of Prime Minister Frederik de Klerk, but Mandela's raised stature actually benefits the government as well as the black-liberation movement. In Mr. De Klerk's brave efforts to dismantle apartheid and achieve radical political reform, it should be more palatable to whites that their president is negotiating with a black leader of Mandela's world standing than with a fatigues-clad guerrilla chieftain.\n\nYet Mandela returns to a country roiled by new outbreaks of strife. White right-wing extremists have conducted a spate of terrorist bombings, including the office of the newspaper that disclosed an assassination plot against De Klerk and Mandela.\n\nMeanwhile, divisions among black groups have been widened, as the African National Congress and affiliated organizations have sought to isolate and discredit other centers of black power.\n\nDe Klerk and Mandela will have to find a path through this minefield of white/white and black/black divisiveness. De Klerk must deal with the right-wing terrorism without further alienating other white conservatives.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy .\n\nMandela's task may be even trickier. He and his colleagues must devise a political mechanism whereby all blacks will feel bound by the settlement eventually worked out with the government, yet which allows the expression of black pluralism. The preservation of healthy black political diversity is important, for it assuages white fears of ultimately being submerged in a one-party black state.\n\nThe democracies that Mandela visited can do more than just burnish his image. South Africa has a crying need for new political ideas, even a new political nomenclature freed of stereotypes and preconceptions. Let economic sanctions remain for now; but new thinking about democracy should flow freely into South Africa. It's time to widen the contacts with South Africa that will stimulate exchanges of ideas.\n\nRelated stories\n\nISSN 2573-3850 (online)\n\n© The Christian Science Monitor. All Rights Reserved. Terms.

But it's Yakima, Wash., that shows the stakes most starkly.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated Dec. 09, 2015, 10:17 a.m. ET | Washington\n\nSome folks said it would be impossible for a Latino candidate to win election to the city council in conservative Yakima, Wash.\n\nCarmen Mendez proved them wrong.\n\nSo did Dulce Gutierrez. So did Avina Gutierrez.\n\nLast month, all three women made history, becoming the first individuals of Hispanic heritage to win election to the seven-member city council traditionally dominated by white conservatives.\n\nWhile their victories sparked celebrations in some parts of town, the achievement came after years of bitter litigation that prompted the redrafting of voting districts and required three Anglo council members to stand for reelection or leave office halfway through their four-year terms.\n\nAnd the fight isn't over. Council members filed an appeal raising a fundamental question: Does the constitutional principle of one person, one vote permit a federal judge to draw voting districts that enhance the power of individual voters in minority districts while diluting voters' clout in predominantly Anglo districts?\n\nThe most recent Yakima election, for instance, saw only 549 voters cast ballots in a redrawn, Latino-majority district. In contrast, 3,593 voters turned out in a predominantly Anglo district.\n\nFor now, the Yakima appeal is on hold, but on Tuesday the United States Supreme Court will hear oral argument in a Texas case that raises the same basic question: If electoral maps are drawn according to total population, does that unconstitutionally dilute the clout of citizens who can actually vote?\n\nThose challenging the Texas system argue that the large numbers of noncitizens in the state can dilute or enhance the power of individual voters from district to district. By their math, the fluctuation of noncitizen population from district to district means some voters cast ballots weighing 1-1/2 times more than those in other districts.\n\nThe case could reshape electoral maps nationwide by addressing the underlying question of whether those who can't vote should continue to be included in the drawing of districts.\n\n\"Instances of extreme electoral imbalance are not confined to Texas,\" writes Francis Floyd of the Seattle law firm Floyd, Pflueger & Ringer in a friend of the court brief filed on behalf of Yakima in the Texas case.\n\n\"This issue will occur with increasing regularity due to the combination of shifting demographic trends and the efforts of organizations like the ACLU using litigation to impose single-member districts on jurisdictions,\" said Mr. Floyd.\n\nThe problem is a relatively new one, Floyd said. Decades ago, districts drawn to be equal according to total population did not create serious imbalances because the total population was a reliable proxy for the number of eligible voters.\n\nNow with an estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the US, total population in many jurisdictions no longer tracks citizen-voter demographics. Nonetheless, many lower court judges continue to enforce legal precedents from an earlier era.\n\nCritics charge that such a system can't possibly comply with one person, one vote. Supporters say the real goal is to ensure there is equal representation, not equality among voters.\n\nIt is an issue that Ms. Mendez, an incoming Latina council member in Yakima, is well positioned to examine from both sides.\n\nAlthough she joined her two colleagues as the first Hispanics to win a seat on the council, her path to victory was quite different. While her colleagues easily won in districts redrawn to increase Latino voting power, Mendez ran in a predominantly Anglo district.\n\nIn that way, her victory undermined the conclusion by the federal judge who mandated the new districts: without a judicial thumb on the scale, the judge held, it would be impossible for a Latino to win a council seat.\n\n\"I feel like some Latino community members aren't completely happy with my victory,\" Mendez says in an interview. \"I think they appreciated the fact that I decided to run, but nobody expected me to win.\"\n\nShe adds: \"Once it happened, they said it proved the opposite of [the central allegation in] the lawsuit.\"\n\nYakima is similar to many areas in the US that have witnessed rapid Hispanic growth. More than 41 percent of Yakima's population of 91,000 is Latino, but Latinos make up only 23 percent of voting age citizens in the city.\n\nBut the fact that no Hispanic candidate had ever prevailed in a city council race was because of politics, not prejudice, some say. No moderate or conservative Latino candidates had ever run for office.\n\nVirtually all of the elected officials that represent Yakima from Congress to the county to the city have been Republicans. In 2012, Republican Mitt Romney outpolled President Obama in Yakima County by 11 points, 54 percent to 43 percent.\n\n\"Yakima is a conservative place,\" says Dave Ettl, a city council member slated to leave office at the end of the month after having his term cut short by the judge.\n\n\"I've been in Yakima for 35 years. It is a left-right issue, not a white-brown issue,\" he says.\n\nOthers have offered a darker explanation: that the city's Anglo residents were voting as a bloc to systematically deprive Latinos of political power.\n\nThe ACLU of Washington filed a lawsuit in 2012 on behalf of two Latino voters who charged that the city's long-time method of using at-large voting for city council diluted Latino voting strength in violation of the Voting Rights Act.\n\nUS District Judge Thomas Rice, an appointee of President Obama, agreed and ordered the city to create seven city council districts, adopting in total the ACLU's proposed districts.\n\nThe new districts were drawn to maximize Latino voting power in part by using the city's large population of Latino noncitizens to fill out Districts 1 and 2.\n\nLatinos totaled 55 percent of eligible voters in District 1. Some 46 percent of eligible voters in District 2 were identified as Latino.\n\nAlthough the city's seven voting districts were roughly equal in total population - ranging in size from 12,500 in District 1 to 13,300 in District 7 - no effort was made to try to equalize the number of voters in each district.\n\nAs part of his remedial action, the judge ordered all seven members of the council to stand for reelection last month. The order included three members who had served only half of their four-year terms.\n\nTwo of the three displaced council members decided not to run again. They include Councilman Ettl and Mayor Micah Cawley, who was reelected to a four-year-term in 2013, winning 11,605 votes - 95 percent of ballots cast under the old city-wide election system.\n\n\"To be thrown out of office two years early is kind of challenging,\" Mayor Cawley says in an interview.\n\nHe said the judicial-ordered election system produced uneven results in last month's election. \"It is troublesome in a city of our size where you can get a few hundred votes and get elected to the city council,\" he said.\n\nThe successful Latino candidate in District 1, Ms. Gutierrez, received 465 votes out of 549 votes cast in that district.\n\nThe winning candidate in predominantly Anglo District 6 received 2,095 votes out of 3,593 total votes cast in that district.\n\nIn terms of eligible voters, District 1 had a citizen voting age population of 4,800, compared with 9,800 eligible voters in District 7, also a predominantly Anglo district.\n\nSuch discrepancies were not lost on Mendez, who won in District 3, where a quarter of eligible voters were Latino. She received 975 votes, 54 percent of votes cast.\n\n\"In my district in order to get the same [winning] percentage as District 1 and District 2, I had to get twice as many votes,\" she said.\n\n\"It is frustrating for me to have to get twice as many votes to get 50 percent, and someone gets half as much as me and gets 80 percent of the vote,\" Mendez said. \"It is frustrating, but unfortunately this is the way it was designed.\"\n\n\"Was it fair,\" she says. \"No.\"\n\nBut Mendez says elections in Yakima are a work in progress. \"What it used to be wasn't working,\" she says. Without the judge's ruling and the resulting city-wide debate over voting rights, she believes she would never have won a seat on the council.\n\nAsked what advice she would offer to other cities with a significant Latino population, Mendez says to make sure all residents receive fair representation. \"I would say if [city officials] don't want to be sued, they should look at their voting system and whether it is representative of their constituents,\" she said.\n\nEttl offered a different response to the same question. \"Hold your breath until June and see what happens\" at the Supreme Court in the Texas case, he said.\n\nIn his friend of the court brief, Floyd urged the high court to provide a ruling with clear instructions for lower courts. He stressed that cities like Yakima need help right now.\n\nEttl says that cities must consciously reach out to minority residents and recruit quality minority candidates. \"But I wouldn't rig the deck and draw the district lines based on race.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Since it was \"too hot for a fiery cross,\" the robed mob brought one draped \"with electric light bulbs.\"\n\nIn December, Mary Parham-Copelan, the city's first Black female mayor, took her second oath of office on the same courthouse steps. She won her first election by five votes. This time she ran unopposed.\n\nIdentity, history, and voting rights are set to collide in Georgia's gubernatorial election, reflecting an evolution of American democracy and a contest over what it means to be Southern.\n\nMayor Parham-Copelan's success here in a town once defined by segregation is a reflection of a state in political flux. A growing Black electorate and a shifting sense of Southern identity is bucking a power structure that has historically been white, male, and rural.\n\n\"It hasn't been the easiest, because people had to adjust to having a female mayor,\" says Mayor Parham-Copelan, who is also a preacher. \"For so much of our time, it has felt like things were going backward. But now here we are and it's moving forward. I think people are voting their own conscience now. ... We just don't know who is capable and what that person can do unless they're given an opportunity.\"\n\nThe central Georgia region to which Milledgeville belongs remained a \"racist police state\" up until the 1970s, says Hamilton College historian Ty Seidule. \"The violence wasn't just racism. It had a political purpose. It was about enforcing white political power.\"\n\nThe state is today in the throes of a less violent, yet related struggle, where majorities of both parties believe democracy is at risk of failing. As Georgia voting rights activist Stacey Abrams seeks to become the nation's first Black female governor in a tough year for Democrats, Republicans are scrambling to control access to the ballot box in the name of election integrity.\n\nGeorgia's gubernatorial election marks not one, but two, high-profile matchups that will be closely watched nationwide. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, who drew former President Donald Trump's ire by refusing to overturn his state's election in 2020, is facing a primary fight with the Trump-backed David Perdue, who lost the Senate runoff election to Jon Ossoff. Whoever wins that contest will then face Ms. Abrams, who lost her first bid for governor by a little over 1% in 2018.\n\nThat all puts Ms. Parham-Copelan's Georgia at the center of a national struggle over identity, power, and the halting evolution - and potential hobbling - of American democracy.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris plan to be in Georgia on Tuesday for the president's voting rights address.\n\nIn a speech last week commemorating the violent bid by Trump supporters on Jan. 6, 2021, to overturn a free and fair election, Mr. Biden said that \"new laws are being written not to protect the vote, but to deny it.\"\n\nA recent NPR/Ipsos poll found that 64% of Americans think U.S. democracy is \"in crisis and at risk of failing.\" Even though 61 lawsuits, numerous recounts, and President Trump's own attorney general found no evidence of widespread fraud, two-thirds of Republican respondents believe that \"voter fraud helped Joe Biden win the 2020 election.\" Three of those recounts, including one by hand, affirmed President Biden's victory in Georgia.\n\nIn that way, Georgia represents how the country has entered a \"new phase\" in the struggle between voting rights and voter mobilization, says Domingo Morel, a political scientist at Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey.\n\n\"Elections are really governed at the county and local level. So what are the ways that the state is going to come in and usurp power from the local community at the local level?\" says Mr. Morel. In a state like Georgia where liberal ideology seems ascendant, \"there are ways that that growing political power - ... that electorate - doesn't get to actually exercise their power commensurate with their numbers.\"\n\nHe adds, \"The undermining of democracy, in my view, really works away in the shadows.\"\n\nGeorgia and her 10 million residents are a study in contrasts, bound by history.\n\nIt is a state where last week a judge sentenced three white men to life in prison for the murder of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man jogging in their neighborhood. In 2020, voters here chose a Democrat - Joe Biden - for president for the first time since 1992. Then, fueled in part by efforts by President Trump to overturn the election, Democrats outpaced Republicans in a runoff, sending Raphael Warnock and Mr. Ossoff - a Black pastor and a Jewish filmmaker - to the U.S. Senate the day before Trump partisans stormed the Capitol.\n\nToday, Mr. Trump remains under investigation for a phone call in which he was recorded asking Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \"find\" over 11,000 votes to overturn Mr. Biden's victory, a potential violation of state election law. Yet, signs along rural roadways here still proclaim \"Trump won.\"\n\nThose statewide races were largely decided in Georgia's urban and suburban counties, where some Republicans, believing Mr. Trump that the vote would be fraudulent, stayed home while Democrats came out in droves. But of the state's 159 counties, some 120 qualify as rural based on population.\n\nIn rural Georgia, \"you get this interesting mix of Trump supporters, country club Republicans, and then you have Black voters, who are overwhelmingly Democratic,\" says Scott Buchanan, a political scientist at Georgia College, in Milledgeville. \"What does that mean? It means that someone like mayor, sheriff, whomever, they really try to stay in the middle, politically speaking, to attract voters from across the spectrum. Because it's almost never a slam-dunk one way or the other.\"\n\nAnd political scientists say it's the rural regions that may come to define Georgia's role in a broader voting rights debate.\n\n\"If you're white in rural Georgia, those are dyed-in-the-wool Trump supporters,\" says University of Georgia political scientist Trey Hood. \"But of course there is the Black Belt area. ... We are a closely divided state and pretty fractured in some ways. It all sort of depends on who decides to show up. That's your electorate.\"\n\nSuch narrow margins in Georgia and other key battlegrounds have put the focus on voting rules. Last year, nearly three dozen laws were passed in 19 states that make it more difficult to vote and in some cases threaten election officials with criminal proceedings, according to the Brennan Center for Justice .\n\nGeorgia lawmakers passed SB 202, a law that put new requirements on absentee voting, allowed the legislature to appoint new election administrators when fraud was suspected - rather than proved - and barred people from handing out water at polling places.\n\nIn 2020, there were 331 fewer polling places in Georgia than in 2012, despite the state's growing population. Lincoln County, which is one-third African American, has plans to go from seven precincts to one in the next election, to make voting \"easier and more accessible,\" according to a press release. The moves, critics say, go beyond efforts to secure the vote to actively discouraging Black voters, who largely are Democrats, from casting ballots.\n\nLike most of Georgia's 139 rural counties, Morgan County is solidly conservative: Four of five county commissioners are Republicans. But Democrats here are energized. In last year's Senate runoff, party leaders delivered 98% of their voters to the polls; Republicans managed 92%.\n\nA few months later, a Republican county commissioner named Ben Riden led an effort to scrap the bipartisan Board of Elections, calling it \"dysfunctional.\" Five other counties joined suit.\n\nDemocrats are concerned that such efforts are laying the groundwork to reverse the will of the people if power continues to slip away from white conservatives.\n\nBut the fight over election administration in Morgan County has also highlighted real problems.\n\nThat debate is healthy, says Morgan County voting rights activist Jeanne Dufort. The challenge, she says, is how to rebuild the kind of public trust that democracy requires to function.\n\n\"It is absurd to imagine a democracy that isn't full of robust debate and big fundamental differences. The miracle is, we pull it off, mostly, except for when we have a civil war or an insurrection,\" says Ms. Dufort. But when lawmakers \"decide that power is the only governor of whether you can do something or not - raw power - then you are going beyond\" founding values.\n\nFor Mr. Riden's part, he says most folks in the county aren't interested in preserving a racial order, but a rural dynamic.\n\nIn fact, Mr. Riden, who is white, says he recruited a Black Democrat to sit on the new Board of Elections. Though party affiliation wasn't on the application, the new board has the same political dynamic as the old one: three Republicans, two Democrats.\n\n\"Let's face it, voting is pretty easy,\" says Mr. Riden. \"Some people think what we did was intended to suppress the vote. It wasn't. It's really to protect the integrity of the vote to make sure that only legitimate people vote.\"\n\nFor Michelle Gilley, a white voter, how those in power define \"legitimate people\" represents the broader challenge over the right to vote.\n\nLast summer, Ms. Gilley bought a house on a creek on the Walton County line.\n\nSoon after, her daughter, Audrey, learned about the 1948 lynching of two African American couples in what is now their backyard. The lynching at the Moore's Ford Bridge came after Gov. Herman Talmadge made a fiery campaign speech warning that blood would run in the streets before Black people would vote in the Democratic primary.\n\nAudrey is building a small commemorative cross for the site.\n\n\"As grown-ups in the South, we have to swallow the past, to never forget it but also make sure that our children do better,\" says Ms. Gilley. \"I think we are learning how to lead with love.\"\n\nBut as part of that reckoning, the South is undergoing another broad shift - one of what it means, beyond race, to be Southern.\n\nTake November's election of Winsome Sears, a gun-toting Black conservative woman, to lieutenant governor in Virginia. North Carolina's current lieutenant governor is African American; he is also a \"Make America Great Again\" devotee.\n\nThat is partly why Ms. Abrams has resisted labels like progressive and moderate. In her last campaign for governor, she visited all 159 counties to talk about Medicaid expansion and saving rural hospitals.\n\n\"The power of the Black vote has been significantly less than the power of the white vote, and that's what reminds us that there's so much at stake,\" says Mayor Preston Blakely of Fletcher, North Carolina. He's the 27-year-old Black leader of a Southern town that is nearly 90% white. \"It's about a voice in government ... and having people that look like us represent us in this ever-changing country and in our ever-changing communities.\"\n\nIn that context, efforts in Georgia and across the South to expand Black leadership, at least in part, \"is African Americans reclaiming what was rightfully theirs: the mantle of Southernness,\" says Christopher Cooper, co-author of \"The Resilience of Southern Identity: Why the South Still Matters in the Minds of its People.\" \"It is a reckoning in how we are thinking about and experiencing our history. It's about the politics of the past and the politics of Southern memory as much as anything.\"\n\nIn Milledgeville, Ms. Parham-Copelan navigates that landscape of memory by focusing on today's problems.

      "text": "Why Won't White Conservatives Admit That Their Issue Isn't Critical Race Theory?\n\nBy Maia Niguel Hoskin\n\nBy Maia Niguel Hoskin ,\n\nContributor.\n\nTOPSHOT - Supporters of US President Donald Trump, including member of the QAnon conspiracy group ...

(Photo by Saul LOEB / AFP) (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe debate over Critical Race Theory continues to wage on. Last year, a video went viral of a man who criticized Critical Race Theory but at the same time could not define it. The man said that Critical Race Theory was the most crucial issue in last year's Virginia gubernatorial election, but later he could not define the theoretical framework or justify his feelings against it. This has led to many who argue that many White Americans who oppose CRT are also completely unaware of what it is.\n\nThat said, proponents of theory argue that there is a large cohort of white Americans who have expressed opposition to the theory who are not guilty of having gaps in knowledge about it, but choose to remain blatantly and willfully uneducated about CRT, which speaks to a larger issue. A larger issue that that points to a deeply rooted rage that stems from fear of anything they perceive to be a threat to their racial privilege. Furthermore, many argue that their indignant and almost boastful resistance to familiarize themselves on the topic of basic U.S. history further illustrates their racial privilege.\n\nThose Who Don't Know About Critical Race Theory\n\nDuring the latter half of last year, a video of a man who stated the most important issue in Virginia's governor's race was banning CRT in schools went viral on Twitter . But in an ironic plot twist, after a few questions, he quickly buckled and admitted that he knew nothing about the theory. Some might feel embarrassed not providing a reasonable argument for their position on such a critical issue. After all, our vote for state elected officials is crucial and can directly affect our everyday lives.\n\nYet, many argued that he did not seem to flinch at the absurdity of his apparent oblivion about CRT. But he is not alone. Others have come before him to rally the troops in a war against CRT while being clueless about the topic. This might help to explain why Glenn Youngkin, the Republican candidate for Virginia governor, who repeatedly decried critical race theory during his campaign and vowed to ban it from Virginia's schools on his first day in office, inevitably won the race on November 4 2021.\n\nThose Who Claim They Know About Critical Theory\n\nA Washington Post opinion piece was recently published, which referred to critical race theory as \"dangerous.\" Many found themselves in opposition not over the columnist's opinion, but rather the inaccuracy of his argument.\n\n\"This is the opposite of what the civil rights movement stood for. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. did not argue that America was systemically racist; he argued that racism was un-American. He appealed to the Enlightenment ideals contained in what he called our \"magnificent\" Declaration of Independence and Constitution and declared his goal was to take \"the whole nation back to those great wells of democracy, which were dug deep by the Founding Fathers,\" writes Washington Post columnist Mark Thiessen.\n\nAlthough many historical accounts of the Civil Rights Leader depict King as one-dimensional and commonly reference his \"I Have A Dream\" speech, King held varying perspectives about racism in the U.S. and was not a one-trick pony. Although he continued to view racism and anti-Blackness in America with optimism for a better tomorrow, he was keenly aware of the reality of the state of race relations in the country.\n\nIn his speech \"Remaining Awake Through a Great Revolution,\" King said this:\n\n\"It is an unhappy truth that racism is a way of life for the vast majority of White Americans, spoken and unspoken, acknowledged and denied, subtle and sometimes not so subtle - the disease of racism permeates and poisons a whole body politic. \"\n\nSimilarly, in a Sunday morning sermon at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., King preached the following:\n\n\"We must come to see that the roots of racism are very deep in our country, and there must be something positive and massive in order to get rid of all the effects of racism and the tragedies of racial injustice.\"\n\nDuring that same sermon, King observed that the same people who have benefitted from the inequitable treatment of Blacks in America are the \"very people who tell Negroes that they must lift themselves by their own bootstraps. It's all right to tell a man to lift himself by his own bootstraps, but it is a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he ought to lift himself by his own bootstraps.\"\n\nIronically, Dr. King's sentiments are at the crux of CRT - engaging in an honest and transparent analysis of the histrionic presence of anti-Blackness and systemic racism in America and discussing how the malignancy of racism has disenfranchised and marginalized Black Americans.\n\nThose Who Don't Know About Critical Race Theory, But Know Enough To Maintain white Supremacy\n\nCritical race theory has a large number of people up in arms. Primarily, white conservatives. So much so that Fox News mentioned the theory more than 1,900 times between May and July 2021. Eight states, including Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona, and South Carolina, have passed legislation to ban CRT. But, except for Idaho, none of the state bills explicitly mention \"critical race theory.\" That said, Montana and South Dakota have denounced teaching concepts associated with CRT. In Florida, Georgia, Utah, and Oklahoma, the state school boards have introduced new guidelines barring CRT-related discussions. Local school boards in Georgia, North Carolina, Kentucky, and Virginia, and almost 20 other states have introduced or plan to introduce similar legislation.\n\nBut there was never a formalized plan made by any state or school district to teach critical race theory as a theoretical framework to students. In all its glory, CRT is far too complex to teach to school-aged students in its entirety and complexity. While earning my doctorate, I used critical race theory in my dissertation. It took me weeks to gain a thorough grasp of the theory in its totality and to easily conceptualize my research topic through that lens. So trust me, even if Donald Trump were to give his most sincere blessing, school administrators - even in the most progressive states - never made curriculum plans around little Billy and Sue learning CRT in third grade.\n\nThat said, although many remain woefully yet proudly uneducated on the topic, a handful of white conservatives who oppose the theory have educated themselves on its tenants. At least enough to strategically present rationale - although flawed and dishonest - to ban it. And those people are the state lawmakers who have drafted and passed legislation to ban it. Again, most state bills do not explicitly mention \"critical race theory.\" But in a mean game of chess, the bills ban discussing, training, or adopting the belief that the U.S. is inherently racist and discussions about conscious and unconscious bias, privilege, discrimination, and oppression. Topics that all - to some extent - can be taught to little Billy and Sue in third grade. Yup, they covered their bases.\n\nThe Truth About CRT, Racism, and Some White Conservatives\n\nSo, while a good number of white Americans who oppose the theory remain utterly unaware of what it is, they are very much in tune with their resistance toward racial equity at the cost of losing their racial privilege. With that comes an unwillingness to acknowledge our country's racist history and how it impacts the current racial climate. Opponents also fear that CRT admonishes all White people for being oppressors while portraying Black people as hopelessly oppressed victims. But these descriptions about CRT are gross exaggerations. CRT does not attribute racism to White people as individuals or even to entire groups of people.\n\nSimply put, critical race theory states racism is embedded in U.S. social institutions (e.g., the criminal justice system, education system, labor market, housing market, and healthcare system), which shape laws, regulations, rules, and procedures that ultimately give favor to Whites and marginalize Blacks. Racism can exist without racists, yet many Americans cannot separate their identity from the idea of America and the social institutions that govern us. Consequently, many of these people see themselves as the system and interpret calling social institutions racist as calling them racist personally.\n\nBottom line: for a large number of White folks, critical race theory has become coded language for 'reducing White supremacy.' While some might click their heels at the thought of eradicating White supremacist culture, others are raging against the machine and fighting tooth and nail to protect their racial privilege. This isn't the first time we have witnessed White America go bonkers over a perceived loss of power. There have numerous large demonstrations of White rage over similar issues.\n\nThe most recent incidents include the violent insurrection at the capitol , the Charlottesville and anti-lockdown protests, and even the deadly actions of Kyle Rittenhouse and Dylan Roof . As crazy as it might sound, this is why some white people feel comfortable remaining ignorant about the tenants of the theory while righteous in their opposition to it. It's almost as if some white Americans are saying: \"I'm white. I don't have to justify my opinions.\" And that attitude, ironically, is a critical component of the very privilege they are fighting to maintain."

      "text": "Why Liberals See Trump As Racist And Sexist While Conservatives Don't\n\nBy Jessi Streib\n\nBy Jessi Streib ,\n\nContributor.\n\nDonald Trump in a Make America Great Again hat\n\nThe recent presidential election resurfaced questions Democrats asked eight years ago: how can so many Americans vote for Donald Trump given his racism and sexism?\n\nWe were curious about this as well, and so we set out to study it. As the conversation around the last election centered on white liberals and white conservatives, we focused our attention on these groups.\n\nUnsurprisingly, white liberals and white conservatives tend to see different individuals, interactions, and institutions as racist and sexist. More revealingly, their difference relates to their definitions of racism and sexism and how they determine whether they occurred.\n\nWhite liberals tend to use broad definitions of racism and sexism. To them, racism and sexism involve mistreating someone due to their race or gender, intentionally or not, as well as unequal outcomes between people of different races and genders. Under this definition, Trump does plenty of things that are racist and sexist. The Muslim ban mainly targets people of one race, and so they deem it racist. His alleged sexual assaults target people of one gender, and so they consider it sexist too.\n\nWhite liberals tend to determine whether their definitions have been met using algorithmic methods. Just as an algorithm can be trained to identify each case that matches a pattern, liberals know many ways that people of color and women are mistreated and call any case that fits that pattern 'racist' and 'sexist.' They do so without gathering evidence about the particular case or considering alternative explanations of what happened. They also assume that most bad things that happen to people of color and women wouldn't have happened to white people or men, and use that presumption as evidence of racism and sexism. When they are in doubt, which they aren't often, they give the benefit of the doubt to the person who accused others of racism and sexism. After all, they reason that racism and sexism happen all the time. It likely happened this time, too.\n\nUsing this lens, they see much of what Trump says and does as racist and sexist. To them, the border wall is racist; Trump doesn't propose a wall along the northern border, too, where more white people live. His comment against the football player and activist Colin Kaepernick ('get that son of a bitch off the field') was racist; he never would have said that to a white player. His comments about Baltimore being rat-infested and Haiti being a shithole were racist; they matched the ways people disparage where Black people live. His support of Kavanaugh was sexist; women often aren't believed that they were sexually assaulted, and Trump fit that pattern. Trump's support for overturning Roe was sexist as well; it negatively affected women.\n\nBut while it's obvious to many white liberals that Trump is racist and sexist, it's not obvious to many white conservatives. They use different definitions and methods and reach different conclusions.\n\nTo many white conservatives, racism and sexism are defined by the intent to mistreat a person due to their race or gender. If a white person hurts a person of color but not because of their race, it's not racist. Likewise, if a man hurts a woman but not because of her gender, it's not sexist. To many conservatives, then, the Muslim ban is not racist; it is about religion and not race. Along the same lines, Trump's alleged sexual assaults are not sexist. He is attracted to women, so that's who he assaulted, but had he been attracted to men, he might have assaulted them. What he did was wrong, many white conservatives say, but it wasn't sexist.\n\nWhite conservatives tend to use their own logic to judge and justify whether something is racist or sexist. They take an i nvestigative approach. Acting like detectives, they dig into the details of the case and try to discern exactly what happened. Who said what, when, and where? What is the accused's history with people of a particular race and gender? They consider alternative explanations: could this have happened for reasons besides racism or sexism? They also make the opposite assumption as liberals; they assume most things could have happened to white people and men. When they lack the evidence they want, which is often, they give the benefit of the doubt to the accused. We live in a country where people are innocent until proven guilty. To them, that's what we should do regarding racism and sexism, too.\n\nUsing this approach, they argue that much of what Trump says and does is not racist or sexist. His comments about Colin Kaepernick were about disrespecting the flag, not about race. Besides, Trump would have said the same to white people who disrespected the flag too. Calling Baltimore rat-infested and Haiti a shithole isn't racism; he was just telling the truth that there are rats in Baltimore and outdoor bathrooms in Haiti. Supporting Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court wasn't sexist; there may very well be a pattern of men assaulting women, but that doesn't mean it happened in this case.\n\nSo how can so many Americans vote for Trump, given his racism and sexism? Easy, it's because many don't think he displays either one."

      "text": "The War On Critical Race Theory Continues As Some Call It Anti-White\n\nBy Janice Gassam Asare\n\nBy Janice Gassam Asare ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nUnder CRT, race is used as a primary mechanism to understand, unpack and analyze the ways that ... More structures and systems continue to perpetuate racial inequality\n\nAs of late, discussions about Critical Race Theory have dominated the public conversation. Critical race theory (CRT) can be conceptualized as \"a framework that offers researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers a race-conscious approach to understanding education inequality and structural racism to find solutions that lead to greater justice.\" Under CRT, race is used as a primary mechanism to understand, unpack and analyze the ways that structures and systems continue to perpetuate racial inequality and uphold a racial hierarchy system. Scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw is cited as one of the originators of the CRT movement along with Neil Gotanda and Stephanie Phillips in 1989. CRT explores how racism is able to endure because it is embedded into the fabric of society. Critical race scholar Dr. Angel Jones shared in an email what initially drew her to study CRT. \"I was originally introduced to Critical Race Theory during my doctoral program. I was immediately drawn to it because, as a Black woman at a predominantly White institution, it was the first time I read a theory that acknowledged the roles that race and racism played in my experiences both inside and outside of the Academy. It made me feel seen.\" CRT is an effective lens to better understand disparities in housing , education , and healthcare , but not everyone is on board with CRT, and some demanding we refrain from teaching it to children in school.\n\nDespite insurmountable evidence of how racism permeates every single system and structure within the U.S. and beyond, there is growing criticism and condemnation of CRT and its validity. Within many countries that have a documented history of slavery and genocide, there is still a failure to acknowledge the gruesome and grotesque legacy of racism that is upheld structurally and systemically to this day. It seems easier to write the past off as a distant memory that no longer impacts our currently reality. In January, Republican House of Representatives member Keith Ammon proposed a bill that was strangely reminiscent of Trump's diversity training ban that was pushed forth in 2020. The bill proposed by Ammon prohibits schools and organizations from contracting individuals who will explore \"divisive concepts\" such as \"race or sex scapegoating,\" The Atlantic reports . Lawmakers in states like Arkansas, Idaho, and possibly Louisiana have introduced similar bills.\n\nWhat's interesting to note is that the CRT backlash is not just coming from white conservatives in southern and rural parts of the U.S. Some of the CRT pushback stems from those who are most impacted by racialized systems. Recently, South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, who also happens to be the only Black Republican in the Senate, remarked that \"America is not a racist country.\" And just days ago, Vernon Jones, a Republican gubernatorial candidate in the state of Georgia, debated academic and political commentator Dr. Marc Lamont Hill on whether CRT should be taught in schools. Jones tweeted \"it's time for our schools to stop teaching our kids to hate America.\" CRT criticism is not just in the U.S. Activist and educator Constanza Eliana Chinea discussed the global CRT backlash in a recent Instagram live conversation. Chinea mentioned British politician Kemi Badenoch, who has been an outspoken opponent of CRT. Badenoch stated that she felt that CRT authors actually want a \"segregated society.\" She also shared that adopting a mindset that Black people are victims simply because of their skin color is \"poisonous for young people.\" There has been similar pushback in France, where anti-racism educators and activists are being accused of \"threatening the values of the republic.\" In Australia there have also been attacks on CRT, with many touting CRT as being \"anti-white.\" The increased wave of backlash against CRT is a direct result of the heightened support for Black Lives Matter following the murder of George Floyd, explained Chinea in her Instagram live video.\n\nCritical race scholar Dr. Angel Jones\n\nAlthough conversations about CRT are likely to be ongoing and contentious, it is vital for everyone to understand how race and white supremacy have impacted the ways that systems and structures operate. \"Learning about CRT is important because in order to challenge systems of oppression, you must first be able to identify them. CRT encourages students to become more civically engaged by equipping them with the tools they need to think critically about issues of race and racism,\" indicates Dr. Angel Jones. Despite the opposition, awareness about CRT is imperative. \"The best way to combat the backlash and criticism about CRT,\" Dr. Jones explains, \"is through education.\" As was witnessed during an interview between Vernon Jones and Dr. Marc Lamont Hill, many challengers of CRT don't have a full and thorough understanding of what it actually is. \"Many of its opponents are unfamiliar with it, and their opposition is resulting from a fear of the unknown,\" explains Dr. Jones. \"Additionally, increased education would also help to dispel the myths and misconceptions about it. Contrary to the false narratives being told, CRT is not the enemy, racism is. And we defeat that enemy by using critical frameworks, like CRT, to help us challenge systemic oppression.\""

      "text": "'American Fiction' Brilliantly Depicts Politically Incorrect Professor\n\nBy John Tamny\n\nBy John Tamny ,\n\nContributor.\n\nProfessor Ellison has been called before the administrators at his Los Angeles-area prestige university. He's offended yet another easily offended student. Ellison asks why they're so \"delicate\" these days, only for the administrators to lightly in tone (but demanding in intent) ask him to take some time away from the classroom.\n\nWhat got him in trouble? In a classroom discussion of Flannery O'Connor's role in southern fiction, Ellison wrote \"the artificial n--r\" on the whiteboard. An offended student raised her hand to tell the professor her difficulty with the \"wrong\" word on the board. Ellison responded dryly that it's not wrong, that it has two gs.\n\nEllison's time away from campus begins in Boston where he's set to attend a major book festival. The problem is that Ellison hates going to Boston, and he hates it because he can't stand his family (prominent medical doctors for the most part) that is still largely based there.\n\nStill, Ellison has the manuscript of his latest novel with publishers (so far they're rejecting it) who will surely populate the conference, so he grudgingly goes himself. As an author of mostly unread novels, Ellison will be on a lightly attended conference panel. This experience has the grouchy Ellison even more perturbed.\n\nWorse, he subsequently walks into a reading by author Sintara Golden. Golden is black, wears Claudine Gay glasses, attended hyper left-wing Oberlin in Ohio, and moved to New York City \"the day after graduation\" so that she could start work for a prominent publisher. Golden's new novel, titled We's Lives In 'Da Ghetto , is all the rage at the festival.\n\nGolden, who speaks impeccably, explains to the nearly all-white audience that she felt readers needed a more realistic portrayal of black life. From there, Golden's reading descends into the broken English that the far-from-the-ghetto raised Golden plainly imagines is a portrayal of \"real\" black life. Ellison is offended, and worse, frustrated as the huge crowd of mostly white readers gives Golden a standing ovation for what they imagine is her remarkable verisimilitude.\n\nA few scenes later, Ellison can be found in a Boston bookstore doing as authors do, looking for his own books. If there's an unreal scene in the film it's this one, and that is so not because the scene isn't funny. It's laugh out loud funny, but writer and director Cord Jefferson might agree that the scene violates the popular truth supposedly first uttered by the late and legendary Random House editor Jason Epstein that \"no author since Homer has ever found his book in a bookstore.\"\n\nFor the purposes of this great film, it's fortunate that Ellison found a stack of his own books, and that he routinely finds his books in bookstores. That is so because it sets him up to complain to a low-level employee that his novels should not be in the African American literature section since they have nothing to do with race. It seems this dressing down of junior employees is the norm for Ellison, and then it gets worse. While attempting to move his novels to the novel section of the bookstore (he's told they'll just be moved back), he happens on a full, standalone display for Golden's We's Lives in 'Da Ghetto .\n\nMy guess is that I didn't do a credible or passably interesting job of hiding the punchline or the \"surprise revelation\" that comes next, but Professor Thelonious 'Monk' Ellison is black . Played by the spectacular Jeffrey Wright ( Asteroid City, Hunger Games, Basquiat ), Monk doesn't hide from his color as much as he doesn't want to be defined by it. He is a writer , not a black writer. He doesn't write about life in the streets, or racial issues, or anything else that racially focused whites (whether left or right) want black people to write or think about. One guesses that if the character were an economic commentator, that he would similarly not write about economics as it relates to blacks. Amen to that!\n\nWithout giving much more away, from the visit to Boston a bigger family story emerges for Monk. Death of a sister, the onset of dementia in his mother, divorce for Monk's plastic surgeon brother, and upper strata financial worries reveal themselves. Amid this, the endlessly cranky Monk starts writing his own version of We's Lives in 'Da Ghetto late one night. It's titled My Pafology , and Monk submits it to his agent as a joke and also a comment about the kind of literature that guilty, left-leaning white readers are really interested in.\n\nMonk's agent doesn't just read the manuscript, he reads it and submits it to publishers, including publishers who'd always rejected Monk's race-free novels. Those who formerly didn't have time for him subsequently court him, and with big checks in hand. Stagg R. Leigh, Monk's pseudonym used for My Pafology , is a criminal with a rap sheet. The police are said by Stagg to be in hot pursuit of him as My Pafology is going to the printer, which makes the novel even more of a hot commodity, so much so that Stagg demands a dealbreaking title change that his obsequious publisher agrees to. Then Hollywood calls with an even bigger check in hand to bring this future bestseller to the screen.\n\nSome, conservatives in particular, will read this write-up and be interested in its portrayal of guilty white left wingers, the black professor who disdains their guilt, along with the film's proper ridicule of white guilt as an excuse for the pursuit of diversity for the sake of diversity. It's all there, including Monk being asked to serve on a prestigious book-prize panel that will decide the year's best book. You guessed it, the organization behind the prominent award wants a bit more \"diversity.\" Yes, conservatives will enjoy the film. Big time. It's fun to see black people mock the same political correctness that members of the right have long similarly mocked.\n\nAt the same time, the view from this right-of-center writer is that while conservatives will surely laugh endlessly during this hilarious and extraordinarily well written film, that it's brilliantly funny for everyone, including left-of-center types. There's a family story that the great Kyle Smith viewed as filler , but that worked for me as a way of explaining Wright's character, and the why behind Wright's character, in entertaining fashion.\n\nAdditionally, it will be said here that conservatives shouldn't walk out of the theater with too smug of a countenance. This is based on their own routine desire to feature black conservatives in their newspapers, magazines and television shows every time a racial situation reveals itself, the tendency of white conservatives to cheer a black person's expressed conservatism regardless of whether it's well-reasoned (I once witnessed a right-leaning black judge give a wholly unremarkable speech that ended with a standing ovation...), not to mention the growing desire of conservatives to deify the \"canceled\" members of their own flock (with book deals, awards, and well-paid jobs) in the way that dopey left wingers deify anything that's \"Black,\" and no matter how ridiculous it is.\n\nBack to the fun within what is the best film of the year in a year that was very good for movies, the publisher of the formerly titled My Pafology submits Stagg Leigh's novel. Monk's panel largely receives it with rapture. To attempt to write out the excitement of the left-leaning, very white panelists would be to diminish what is so well written. Cord Jefferson's American Fiction is topical, the big laughs are constant, and if asked it will be my favorite film of 2023, by far. Run, don't walk."

      "text": "How GOP Voter Suppression Efforts Contributed To Obama Win\n\nBy Rick Ungar\n\nBy Rick Ungar ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\n(Photo credit: Mrs. Gemstone)\n\nI am always fascinated by the way Republican politicians cannot get through a speech without extolling the 'great spirit of America', while completely failing to recognize that the great spirit they speak of is not the sole and exclusive province of the white conservatives and evangelicals who form the vaunted base of their party.\n\nThis lack of recognition, when it comes to our minority communities, is one of the great blind spots of those who identify with the GOP-a blind spot that is not unlike the many ( not all) pro-life folks who will support all sorts of radical behavior to save the life of an unborn child and then completely lose all interest in whether that child lives or dies once he or she has safely landed on terra firma.\n\nBut if the GOP didn't get it before, even the most resistant among them must now understand what so many others have known all along -America's minority communities very much possess the great American spirit.\n\nAnd they are not afraid to use it.\n\nIf you doubt this, continue trying every trick in the book to keep these people from voting. Try passing more voter ID laws, just months before a national election, designed to make it more difficult for members of minority communities to achieve proper identification so that they might cast their vote. Carry on clamping down on early voting opportunities knowing full well that minority communities have a long history of turning out early to vote their preferences. Keep on shutting down the polls on the weekend preceding an important election knowing full well that there is a tradition in the Black community of voting after Sunday church.\n\nTry all of this and more and do you know what will happen?\n\nAmerica's minority communities will continue to show up at the polls in massive numbers and cast their vote-even when it means waiting up to 9 hours in the rain to accomplish the job-because that is precisely what they did this past Tuesday.\n\nThey will do this not only because they understand the profound importance of fulfilling this critical obligation of American citizenship. They will do this so that all will know that nobody is going to take back this hard-won, precious right that so many fought-and some died-to achieve.\n\nDespite efforts in 33 GOP controlled states to restrict the vote, exit polls reveal that the minority share of the 2012 electorate increased from 26 percent in 2008 to 28 percent in 2012. Voting among the African-American community remained steady at 13 percent of the total electorate.\n\nIndeed, it was this increased participation by our minority communities provided their candidate, President Barack Obama , with the votes he needed to accomplish his margin of victory.\n\nFor those who seek to win elections the old fashioned way-by denying the vote to those more likely to support your opponent-you might want to take a shot at getting your arms around what 75 year old Yancy Jones of Inglewood, California, a man strugging with the debilitating effects of a recent stroke, had to say in an interview published in the The Daily Beast :\n\n\"This entire campaign has just made me so upset with this country that I thought had come further along,\" Jones said slowly. \"Some of the same things my parents fought against and I fought against were back into play, like the right to vote. There was no way I could let that happen, so I had to come and vote for Obama whether I felt good health-wise or not.\"\n\nThat, my friends, is the very personification of the great American spirit that our Republican friends are so quick to claim as their own.\n\nWhat should now be clear to even the most ignorant and regressive of state legislators and billionaire businessmen is that there is nothing they can throw at these people that is going to dissuade them from exercising their constitutionally protected right to vote. This will continue to be the case whether the effort to deny them emanates from the office of a governor in Florida, the Secretary of State in Ohio, a Republican controlled legislative body in Pennsylvania or the headquarters of a Kansas based energy company controlled by two brothers who may understand a few things about making big money but haven't a clue as to what the American spirit is really all about.\n\nSo to those of you who continue to think that suppressing the vote is the way to victory, keep it up. The harder you work at playing dirty, the more the nation's minorities will fight back where and when it counts the most-\n\nBy showing up to vote.\n\ncontact Rick at thepolicypage@gmail.com and follow me on Twitter @rickungar"

      "text": "The Good, The Bad, The Odd: Stories That Impacted People Of Color In 2021\n\nBy Maia Niguel Hoskin\n\nBy Maia Niguel Hoskin , Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Providing provocative views on racism, pop culture, and mental health.\n\nBy Maia Niguel Hoskin ,\n\nContributor.\n\nShocked African American couple look at laptop screen frustrated by debt email paying bills online. ... More Stunned biracial man and woman surprised by unexpected bad unpleasant news online on computer.\n\nAlthough the jury is still out on whether 2021 has been a welcome breath of fresh air compared to the hellacious 12 months that made up 2020, one thing is for sure - it's been a wild ride. A lot has happened, especially for people of color. From the good, bad, the not so bad, bizarre, the somewhat funny, and the flat-out ugly - in no particular order - here are 10 stories that impacted people of color in 2021.\n\n1. Vice President Kamala Harris makes history\n\nFirst and foremost, Kamala Harris became the first Black, Indian, and woman vice president of the United States of America. That right there is a mic drop.\n\n2. Increased vaccine and Covid-19 measures\n\nOf course, all matters Covid-19 related and adjacent are at the top of the list. In January, during his first day in office, President Joe Biden signed a total of 10 executive orders to combat the coronavirus that had - and continues to - rock the nation. Specifically, President Biden aimed his efforts toward vaccination accessibility. Although both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were made available to all adults over 16 years of age in December 2020, there was a severe lag in vaccination rates, and the majority of adults remained unvaccinated by the end of January 2021. More specifically, the number of vaccinated adults among people of color was almost dismal. Biden also directed his efforts toward emphasizing the importance of mask-wearing and required masks to be worn in airports and certain types of public transportation such as ships, intercity buses, airplanes, and trains.\n\nJust a few months later, in March, Biden directed states to make all adults eligible for coronavirus vaccinations no later than May 1 to assist the country's return to some sense of normalcy by the beginning of July, which he did - to an extent. For many, the continued push for vaccination accessibility and mandated mask-wearing played a significant role in the first drop in Covid-19 cases that we saw during the spring and early summer of 2021. These measures also significantly impacted people of color, many of whom were more vulnerable to contracting the virus, experiencing more severe and sometimes even deadlier symptoms after contracting the virus, and who face lowered access to affordable and quality medical care. Targeted efforts to slow down the virus's spread also helped address some of the disparities that we saw among people of color relative to the virus. Next up, omicron!\n\n3. Schools reopening\n\nIn 2020, for many, it felt as though the world stopped for almost a full year. Life as we knew it was no longer. Indoor dining was a thing of the past, and we could no longer run into the mall to pick up a quick item or even kick up our feet with a bucket of greasy popcorn to watch the latest blockbuster at the movie theater. Schools were also closed, and students - from as young as three through adults - were forced to adjust to a foreign and very new approach to learning: fully online instruction.\n\nOnline learning further exacerbated existing disparities and created new ones for many families and students of color. Challenges such as malnutrition, childcare, and students falling further behind became significant challenges for many students and their caregivers who had already struggled in these areas before the pandemic. Not to mention the lack of social interaction and connection that all students missed during this time. Well, in February 2021, that all changed . At the beginning of 2021, the CDC released guidance for schools to follow to begin safely reopening for in-person learning. Simultaneously, the Department of Education released the first volume of its guidance for in-person learning to supplement the CDC's recommendations.\n\nDespite some of the concerning issues that online learning caused for many students and their families, the decision to reopen schools was not met with a resounding celebration. Many families of color were frightened by the prospect of their little one contracting the virus, and even worse, spreading it to the rest of their family - especially students who live with family members or caregivers who are elderly or have preexisting health conditions. When schools first began reopening, there were no huge reported outbreaks. However, in more recent news with the new omicron variant on the loose, many schools have experienced outbreaks and have decided to make a sharp return back to online learning - at least temporarily. I suppose we will have to wait and see what's in store for students of color and their families at the start of 2022.\n\n4. Continued hate crimes directed toward Asian Americans\n\nWith the divisive rhetoric of the previously administration, who described the coronavirus as \"the China virus\" and \"kung flu,\" sadly, it's no surprise that hate crimes directed toward Asian Americans saw a sharp increase in 2020. In fact, despite overall hate crime numbers declining by about 6%, hate crimes directed toward Asian Americans increased by almost 150% in 16 of the largest U.S. cities last year. Unfortunately, this horrific trend continued into 2021, and stories like the 64-year-old grandmother who was assaulted and robbed in San Jose, California, or the 52-year-old Asian American woman shot in the head with a flare gun have made Asian Americans increasingly more fearful for their physical safety. According to a new poll from NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, one in four Asian Americans feared that members of their household would be attacked or threatened in the past few months because of their race or ethnicity.\n\n5. Trials that sparked mild contentment and deeply rooted resentment\n\nThe Derek Chauvin trial perhaps marked the beginning of 2021's most controversial and publicized trials. On April 20, 2021, Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer, was found guilty of murdering George Floyd and sentenced to 22 and a half years in prison on June 25. Although many celebrated the verdict as an indication of the judicial system working in favor of the Black community and people of color overall, others cautioned people of color not to bring out their proverbial champagne flutes to toast just yet. Instead of being pacified by one conviction as representative of justice for George Floyd, Chauvin's conviction was simply a police officer being held accountable and facing the consequences for being murderous.\n\nAs the year went on, we continued on a roller coaster of emotions that were further shaken by the Kyle Rittenhouse trial and the trial for the three men responsible for the murder of Ahmaud Arbery. On November 19, 2021, Rittenhouse was acquitted of all charges associated with shooting and killing two men at a Black Lives Matter protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin - a verdict that left people of color shell-shocked and feeling invisible and silenced. But just one week later, on November 24, William \"Roddie\" Bryan, Travis McMichael, and Gregory McMichael were all found guilty of murdering Arbery on November 24, 2021. Through it all, it feels like people of color have shared a starring role on a sad, sick, and very serious episode of Pranked - being teased and tormented by differing trial outcomes that should have all shared firm guilty verdicts but sadly, did not. Although we will take the wins, the losses further prove that we have a long way to go before the justice system works effectively for all its citizens - including people of color.\n\n6. Banning critical race theory in schools\n\nAlthough no school districts have come forward with formal plans to teach critical race theory (CRT) in their curriculum, White Americans - more specifically, White conservatives - have taken CRT to task and have worked overtime to ban it . Overwhelmingly, critics of CRT have demonstrated a complete lack of understanding about the theory and its tenants. Yet, they have dug their heels in to oppose the reality that American values, norms, and mores are centered and rooted in racist and White supremacist ideology. This explains why eight states , including Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona, and South Carolina, have passed legislation to ban the theory in schools. Additionally, Florida, Utah, and Oklahoma school boards have introduced new guidelines barring CRT-related discussions.\n\nMore specifically, local school boards in Georgia, North Carolina, Kentucky, and Virginia, and almost 20 other states have introduced or plan to introduce similar legislation. Most state bills do not explicitly mention \"critical race theory.\" But they explicitly ban any discussion, training, or adaptation of the belief that the U.S. is inherently racist and conversations about conscious and unconscious bias, privilege, discrimination, and oppression. It sounds like many schools will continue pushing more turkey cut out activities during Thanksgiving and lessons around Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have A Dream\" speech as a complete whitewashed documentation of the history of racism in our country.\n\n7. The abortion ban\n\nTexas is not only known for cowboy boots, football, fantastic BBQ, and queso dip. They are also the first state to ban abortion in the U.S. On September 1, 2021, the Lone Star State passed an act to effectively ban abortion after detecting an unborn child's heartbeat, which usually occurs after about six weeks of pregnancy and before most women learn that they are expecting. But Texas lawmakers didn't stop there. The act affectionately referred to as the Texas Heartbeat Act, allows everyday people like ourselves to sue abortion providers and anyone else who assists a woman with terminating a pregnancy - including those who give a woman a ride to a clinic or provide financial assistance to obtain a termination. Private citizens who bring these suits don't need to show any connection to those they are suing, and the law makes no exceptions for cases involving rape or incest.\n\nSince September, other states have jumped on the bandwagon to impede women's reproductive rights. In fact, 21 states have positioned themselves to immediately ban or acutely curtail access to abortions if the Supreme Court chooses to overturn or weaken Roe v. Wade . However, one of the most central concerns behind the ban is that some of the lawmakers who support the ban represent states with large numbers of Black and Latino residents and also have the most compromised and vulnerable health care systems. For example, a study recently found that Black infants in Texas are twice as likely as White infants to die before their first birthday.\n\nWhile Texas does not report deaths among new mothers by race, it's been reported that the national Black maternal mortality rate was 44 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2019 compared to a rate of barely 18 White deaths. And as an overall indicator of the inequity of the Texas health care system, in 2018, Black Texas residents were almost twice as likely as Whites to die of preventable conditions because they did not get the health care they needed. The state of Mississippi is not much better. Many fear abortion bans will impose restrictions on women's reproductive rights that will intensify the vulnerabilities in these states' health care systems and further compound racial disparities in maternal health.\n\n8. The media's obsession with missing white women\n\nThe family of Gabby Petito reported the young woman missing on September 11, and the media immediately flocked to cover her disappearance to assist in locating her safe and sound. Although Petito's disappearance deserved media attention, many expressed concerns over inequitable media coverage of missing person cases. Mainstream media seems overly fascinated with covering endangered or missing White women but remain disinterested in cases involving women from racially and ethnically marginalized groups. The late PBS anchor and best-selling author, Gwen Ifill, coined the term \"missing White women syndrome\" to better illustrate the continued invisibility, forced silence, and dehumanization of the lives of Black women in juxtaposition to the immense value centered around the well-being and safety of White women.\n\nWhile Petito continued to trend on almost every social media platform for weeks, numerous missing cases of people of color went unacknowledged: Emily Lu , a 72-year-old Chinese American woman whose body was found in July after being missing for two months; Jelani Day , who was last seen alive on August 24 but found floating in the Illinois River one week later; Daniel Robinson , a Black geologist who has been missing since June 23; and countless other missing people of color who have remained nameless to everyone but those who love them.\n\n9. R. Kelly found guilty\n\nIn September, R & B singer extraordinaire R. Kelly was found guilty of nine charges, including bribery, forced labor, kidnapping, exploitation of a child, racketeering involving six alleged victims, and sexual trafficking across state lines. This was a long time coming considering allegations of abuse toward Black young boys and girls spanned over almost three decades. During which time, R. Kelly hid in plain sight, calling himself the pied piper - a fictional character who lured and kidnapped children with his flute - by preying on Black women, men, and children. I would be willing to guess if he preyed on White women, men, and children, his time would've been up years ago.\n\n10. Jussie Smollett's strange testimony and trial\n\nThe former Empir e actor was found guilty earlier this month for reporting a fake hate crime in 2019. The story of Smollett allegedly paying two brothers to fake an attack against him had been a controversial topic, and many have presented different theories about why he may have staged the altercation. Despite whether a person believes the actor's guilt or innocence - one thing is for sure. His recent trial was nothing short of odd and bizarre.\n\nDuring his trial, Smollett's testimony was riveting at best and a bit nutty at worst. Despite damming video footage of the actor and the two brothers performing a \"dry run\" of the attack, Smollett maintained that the incident was not a hoax and then proceeded to share details about drug use, masturbation, bathhouses and also conveniently found a way to throw CNN's Don Lemon under the bus all while doing so. This is not an indictment on the actor's guilt or innocence but a reflection of how absurdly kooky his testimony was during the trial. Needless to say, for many, the verdict was not a surprise."

      "text": "The Real Reasons Stacey Abrams May Have Lost Georgia's Gubernatorial Race\n\nBy Maia Niguel Hoskin\n\nBy Maia Niguel Hoskin ,\n\nContributor.\n\nATLANTA, GA - NOVEMBER 06:  Democratic Gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams addresses supporters at ... More an election watch party on November 6, 2018 in Atlanta, Georgia.  Abrams and her opponent, Republican Brian Kemp, are in a tight race that is too close to call.  A runoff for Georgia's governor is likely.  (Photo by Jessica McGowan/Getty Images)\n\nThis year's elections that took place earlier in November were somewhat controversial and caused plenty of debate between voters on both sides of the aisle. Among Hershel Walker and Steven Warnock, Stacey Abrams was a candidate who generated conversation about her gubernatorial run for Georgia. Many rallied in support of Abrams, who would have been the first Black woman to serve as the southern state governor and was the first Black woman to run for Georgia state governor. However, she ultimately lost to Republican Brian Kemp , Georgia's current Governor. Some have questioned if Abrams' loss was more so centered around anti-Blackness and sizeism - among other factors related to the former candidates' appearance and personal life - as opposed to her experience and promise.\n\nAs votes continued to be tallied throughout the evening and into the night of November 8, it eventually became clear that the democratic candidate and former Minority Leader of the Georgia House of Representatives had lost her gubernatorial run to the current Georgia Governor, Republican Brian Kemp. It was a disappointing loss to the many voters who supported Abrams and were optimistic about her taking over the helm as governor. The loss was especially disappointing, as this was Abrams' second gubernatorial bid. Many of her supporters have been at a loss when trying to understand possible factors behind the outcome better.\n\nAbrams received widespread support, and many expressed excitement over promises she made, such as expanding Medicaid, making housing more affordable for Georgia residents, providing better support to Georgia small businesses and small farms, and providing free technical college and need-based financial aid to college students. Some are pointing to factors that had very little to do with her politics and experience and more with her appearance and personal life. Goldie Taylor wrote an article for the Daily Beast after Abrams lost, where she referred to her as \"a symbol, the living embodiment of what many believed Georgia could and should be.\" Taylor also explored some of the factors that may have contributed to Abrams' loss.\n\nIn the article, Taylor echoed the sentiments of others about some of the scrutiny that Abrams faced that other candidates had not. Questions related to her weight, marital status, and sexuality - to name a few. Specifically, questions about her losing weight and if she was married. Previous articles by various publications have even been published about Abrams' weight. Taylor argued that to some conservatives, Abrams represented \"everything they feared most- a proverbial boogeyman,\" with a loosey-goosey crime policy, who was determined to raise their taxes and forever destroy their way of life. All of which Taylor acknowledged were severe exaggerations from reality and only resided in the minds of some white conservatives. However, others have argued that Abrams' appearance was also why she lost her second gubernatorial run.\n\nSimply put, many argue that Stacey Abrams is a brilliant political powerhouse with tremendous promise and potential. But she is also an outspoken Black female progressive. She does not have long, flowing hair down her back. Instead, she wears a short natural hairstyle. She does not wear a size two. Instead, she is full-figured. Her skin is not fair like Vice President Kamala Harris or President Barak Obama. Instead, she is a deep rich brown complexion. She is an unmistakable and unapologetic Black woman with a commanding presence. Many are questioning if Abrams were fairer in complexion with long, straight hair and a slighter more petite frame, would she have been more digestible not only to white conservatives but also to some democrats and even some members of the Black community, such as rapper, Killer Mike. Although unfortunate that such questions still must be posed in 2022, they are not entirely absurd given the constant issues that persist in America related to racism, sexism, misogyny, anti-Blackness, sizeism, and colorism."

      "text": "None Of The Above: 2012, A Transformational Political Year?\n\nBy Ralph Benko\n\nBy Ralph Benko ,\n\nContributor.\n\nImage by AFP/Getty Images via @daylife\n\nThe  game of Political Musical Chairs seems to be propelling Jon Huntsman toward outperforming expectations in New Hampshire. The Wall Street Journal's rhapsody that his economic growth plan is \"Better than anything so far from the GOP presidential field\" may move more Granite Staters than expected.\n\nYet the disaffection, trending toward apathy, that America is feeling toward its politicians is bleeding into the 2012 race, possibly setting the stage for ... the totally unexpected.  Apathy?  The Tea Party - which not so long ago was turning out over a million people on the National Mall - has bored itself into hibernation. Occupy Wall Street has been reduced to a dispirited tent city in Washington .  According to most of the front page of Sunday's Washington Post it mostly is good for romantic liaisons.  Devoting Page One to this implies the Post , too, finds the presidential race strangely uninteresting.\n\nDisaffection?  Progressive enthusiasm for President Barack Obama has been replaced by a hard slog by party regulars.  Obama now is being pilloried by the Feisty Left for a \"trail of betrayals,\" as a \"coward\" and \"traitor\" who \"for now on desperation is his path.\"  He's also been called a \" Trojan Horse, A Psychopath, A Bad Boyfriend .\"\n\nAnd it looks very possible that the badly overdue cyclical recovery now, notwithstanding the inane growth-curdling polices of liberal Democrats, may be getting under way. James Altucher , in his extraordinarily perceptive column \" My Last Death Threat in 2011 \"  points out the inconvenient truths.  Housing inventories are at the lowest level since 1963, corporate profits are at an all time high, cash in the bank is at an all time high, announced stock buybacks are at an all time high, consumer spending is at an all time high, household obligations are the lowest since 1993.\n\nThese (and more) point to what could be a rip-roaring recovery.  If recovery, cyclical though it would be, is at hand Obama will receive credit, foredooming the Republican nominee.\n\nWe mere citizens are having a hard time staying interested.  \" This pudding ,\" once complained Churchill , pushing away his dessert course \" has no theme! \"  The headline of an earlier column here, \"The End of Politics :  The Dawning Irrelevance of Obama and the GOP\", suggests why voters are so disengaged:  irrelevance.\n\nWith a half century of total war ending and something like peace breaking out politics loses its life-and-death drama.  If prosperity joins peace, as threatening, it will be hard for an Oval Office address to draw as many viewers as How I Met Your Mother .\n\nExcitement is likely to return, however, emerging from outside the old two party paradigm.  There are a number of transformative developments simmering below the media's radar.  Any one of these, if it pops, could upend the stale status quo.\n\nConsider just a few:\n\n-- \"Lessig's Lab\" at Harvard Law School is incubating an entity (upon whose board this columnist may have been asked, and may even have agreed, to sit) to make Article V (State originated single issue) Constitutional Conventions a regular feature of our politics, putting vastly more power into the hands of the people as a regular thing. Populism with teeth.\n\n--Almost unnoticed, North Dakota State Senator Curtis Olafson and a few others are unleashing a national movement of state legislators designed to transfer the power to raise the debt ceiling from the Congress to the States. Voila:  a federal balanced budget .\n\n--Texas statutorily is permitted to carve out from within its territory four microstates, each the size of Rhode Island with a population slightly larger than that of Wyoming.  This would reduce Texas's size and population by an immaterial 1% to 2% yet send eight more Texan-type Senators and four more Congressmen to Washington.  If this catches on, prepare to watch the Liberals in the federal government being crushed, driven before you, and to listen to the lamentations of their women .\n\n--A national movement has been proposed (and could be worthily led) by public intellectual Walter Kirn to change a rule and allow Members of Congress to vote on laws by telecommunication.  This would, of course, immerse our national lawmakers in their constituents, insulating them from the lobbyists, utterly changing the chemistry of our federal government.\n\n--And just for good measure the possibility of a Conservative-Black Alliance (Blacks being even more ardently pro straight marriage than most white conservatives) emerges.  Not only would it completely stop the march away from traditional marriage.  It would create an entirely new array of opportunities both for African Americans and the Republican Party.  African Americans, says Rasmussen, are the most enthusiastic demographic group for the gold standard!\n\nThere are more profoundly interesting proposals such as the restoration of the gold standard, a favored topic of this column.  Most are at an early stage.  Some never will get off the ground.  But one is bearing down the tracks like a runaway locomotive: Americans Elect . (This columnist already belongs.  Enlist!) This is the big wild card in the 2012 cycle.\n\nAmericans Elect is spending $20 million to achieve ballot lines in all 50 states.  It reportedly was designed as a refuge for the mythical raging moderates.  By the time its creators discover that there are few \"raging moderates\" (moderates, having moderate dispositions, don't rage) the genie will be out of the bottle.\n\nSoon the GOP truculently will settle on a nominee, ending the 2012 nomination drama long before the general election drama is ripe.  Media Jackals like this columnist must look elsewhere to sustain your interest.  What looks to emerge - next Spring - will be a tsunami of media reports on \"the Internet Primary.\"\n\nLeft wing nuts seem sure that AE is a secret project of the Kochs.  Right wing nuts are convinced AE is a secret project of Soros.  The evidence is that AE is the project of the man who fused the Web to the radical concept of...grocery delivery, earning himself several hundred million dollars. Peter Ackerman, a founder of Freshdirect, apparently somehow got enough of his poker buddies to ante up to raise the money to do this right.\n\nHowever disconcerting to the conspiracy-minded there appears nothing sinister behind an effort to disintermediate, from the parties, a presidential nomination.  And because it requires its nominee to pick someone from the other party its ballot line cannot be appropriated either by Obama or the GOP.  This has the potential to make a huge impact on this election cycle and on all future politics.\n\nThe novelty and drama of Americans Elect is likely to transfix the political chattering class throughout the Spring and Summer.  The publicity generated has the potential to drive millions to participate in this work of political genius (and to taste their own Power).\n\nWho will its nominee be?  Can she win?  Which of the Two Political Oligarchies', um, major national political parties', nominees will it benefit?  Will it act as a spoiler?  Is it viable?\n\nYeah:  Pundit Catnip.\n\nThe duties of citizenship are a pain in the neck.  That's why we have let the Governing Class get away with conduct tantamount to embezzlement (if not outright murder).  But ... it's our country . And if we let it go to Hell without a fight we have nobody but ourselves to blame. It's called Participatory Democracy for a reason. If you wish to hang on to your Bitching Rights, dear Reader, join up or join in.  Use your Power As A Citizen to wreak some unholy Hell on a corrupt and inept Governing Class.\n\nPolitical transformation, like the recovery, is overdue.  It has been seeking - MoveOn,org, the Tea Party, Occupy - a channel. Americans Elect may prove to be it.\n\nTune in. Drop in. Turn out."

It's something I wish more conservatives, especially white conservatives, spent time thinking about, as we head into Black History Month.\n\nIt's common in conservative settings these days to mount a strong defense against the Left's constant racialization of American life. One sees in conservatives a concerted effort to put aside racial context and aim for a unifying vision under American nationalism. But sometimes, conservatives can lose sight of the fact that we are more than capable of being proud of being Black just like we're proud of being American.\n\nOur lens of a racialized world doesn't make it worse than theirs; it just makes it different.\n\nI don't believe white conservatives are malicious in wanting to move away from race, despite what the Left may say. The difference stems from the fact that for most of them, race isn't something they need to be consistently mindful of in their day-to-day activities; nor is it something for them to be proud of.\n\nAnd while no one is actively attempting to rid our calendars of Black History Month, for the past few years, I've noticed among some conservatives a skepticism toward this celebration because it appears that our ideological foes, the woke progressive Left, have parasitically clamped onto it like a tick on a deer's flesh.\n\nThis culture war we've been participating in has some on the Right believing that even acknowledging someone's race is part of a woke strategy to further divide our nation.\n\nYet for many Black Americans, being Black is important to us. It's something we're proud of. We don't want it to be erased from the conversation. And conservatives insisting that we erase the uniqueness of the Black experience and subsume it under a more generic view of America can feel like purposefully discounting what's important to us.\n\nThat's my message to conservatives at the start of this Black History Month: In our zealousness to do the opposite of what the Left is advocating for, let us not create results contrary to what we desire, which is a more inclusive nation, a more inclusive Right.\n\nIt's time to rescue Black History Month from the woke Left, a mission doubly important given the Republican roots of the commemoration, which was started as \"Negro history week\" in 1926 by Carter G. Woodson and was purposefully timed to coincide with the birthdays of Republican President Abraham Lincoln, signer of the Emancipation Proclamation, and Frederick Douglass, a former slave, social reformer and loyal Republican . Fifty years later, the week was expanded to a month-long national observation by Republican President Gerald R. Ford , who believed it was time to \"seize the opportunity to honor the too-often neglected accomplishments of Black Americans in every area of endeavor throughout our history.\"\n\nIn other words, Black History Week began as a way of highlighting historically significant Republican figures who contributed to the betterment of Black Americans and was later expanded by a Republican president to decrease the deficiency of education surrounding our accomplishments and contributions.\n\nYet some of today's Republicans are ready to discard an honorable gesture from their party's past because the progressive Left has infected it with a neo-Marxist framework.\n\nRepublicans of the past understood that if we avoid our history, we're doomed to repeat it, and just because we've experienced immense racial progress since 1926, doesn't mean we should be hubristic about being incapable of repeating the immoral actions of our nation's ancestors.\n\nThe Black American story is filled with examples of triumphing against the odds, overcoming generational strife, and making tragic moments the impetus for us to change. By disengaging with anything that has \"Black\" attached to it because it appears \"woke,\" you're allowing these ideologues to reimagine our past and present Black history as an existence of oppression.\n\nBlack Americans may vote overwhelmingly for Democrats , but it's a mistake to believe that we are all progressive activists who want Black Lives Matter to have an honorable mention in February. Actually, just 3 percent of progressive activists are Black ; two-thirds of Black Americans are conservative or moderate.\n\nIt's not woke to pay homage to Black historical figures who positively contributed to American society. Conservatives: It's time to embrace Black History Month.\n\nAdam B.

The Judiciary Committee panel that presided over Clarence Thomas's fate was symbolic of white male power in America. So was the Senate, all white and 98 percent male. Name any other power precinct of society and it's controlled by white men. So why do they think they're so oppressed?\n\nSince 1980 white males have behaved as some minorities do: as a voting bloc. It's America's largest, casting some 37 million votes in 1988. Over the last three presidential elections, white males have voted for the Republican candidate by roughly a 2-1 margin. The numbers are especially startling in the South, where in 1988 seven in 10 white men voted for George Bush. Those voters were a bedrock of Thomas's support. \"He became a proxy for white males, as well as blacks,\" says Alabama political scientist Natalie Davis. \"Bush shored up his base with white males, and reached out for blacks at the same time.\" Most key Southern Democrats stuck with Thomas for fear of offending white conservatives-and rural blacks-in their home states.\n\nEven as some Democrats look for ways to exploit the anger of women, stoked by the Thomas confirmation, strategists know they can't win in 1992 if the white male bloc remains intact. \"We're losers if we can't eat into that Republican base among white males,\" says Alabama-bred Frank Greer, a media adviser to Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. \"We've been giving away too much of the electorate.\"\n\nAmerica is divided into opposing camps of \"political correctness.\" One stresses legally enforced \"fairness\" and tolerance race, gender and sexual orientation. The other worships individual rights and \"traditional\" religion and family roles. White males, judging by their voting record, are overwhelmingly in the latter camp.\n\nThe clashing cultures can be plotted on a political weather map. High-pressure areas of \"fairness\" PC are in the Northern Yankee tier and the Northeastern media centers and on the West Coast. \"Traditional\" PC dominates in the South and newer suburbs elsewhere. Davis, a Democratic National Committee member, says that, in Alabama, \"young white males,\" 18 to 24 years old, identify with the Republican Party by a monolithic 9-1 margin.\n\nA cottage industry has arisen in Washington to explain such numbers. In new books, authors Thomas and Mary Edsall (\"Chain Reaction\") and Peter Brown (\"Minority Party\") point squarely to race. They argue that the moving force today isn't racial hatred per se. It's white male fears that affirmative action will channel jobs to minorities and women. Census figures show that the median income of white males has declined since 1969. Minorities and women still make less money, but their income curves are rising. In Louisiana last weekend, there was strong evidence that economic fears had unleashed racial resentment that even Republicans can't control. David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard turned unsanctioned Republican, won a place in next month's gubernatorial runoff by appealing to white concerns about losing jobs to \"them.\"\n\nRace and money are only part of the equation. In presidential elections, voters-men in particular--are drawn to candidates who project \"strength,\" says Elaine Kamarck, an analyst at the Progressive Policy Institute, a think tank searching for ways to recapture lost Democrats. \"The most important part of the job description, after all, is commander in chief.\" In 1992 Republicans will emphasize how Bush has played that role.\n\nBut \"strength\" doesn't just apply to military matters. \"Male voters look for the 'stronger' candidate,\" says GOP strategist Ed Rollins. \"That translates into someone who will stand up and be tough in dealing with interest groups.\" GOP strategists think the anger of women's-rights activists will work in the GOP's favor. The more Democratic candidates adopt feminist rhetoric, they say, the better for the Republicans. \"The women's groups are going to push the whole Democratic field farther to the left,\" says GOP strategist Craig Shirley. Democratic insiders privately express a similar concern. \"How can we show we'll stand up to the next Saddam Hussein,\" asks one, \"if we can't stand up to Betty Friedan?\"\n\nAnd now the Democrats may have to mount a new defense on their own most solid voter base, black voters. On the White House lawn last week Bush presided over Thomas's oath-taking in a campaign-style ceremony. The audience was integrated, the message clear: welcome. Republican operatives think they see a win-win situation. They can secure black votes in the rural South, where Thomas's story is especially evocative and born-again Christianity crosses color lines. They can offer Thomas as a signpost to lure black entrepreneurs and professionals. But even if Bush fails to win more black votes, he can push the Democrats to spend more time on black concerns, reinforcing the notion of a party beholden to interest groups. \"It's what we call in chess a \"fork,\" says a GOP insider. \"Either way, they lose something. \"\n\nPart of the Democrats' strategy for getting the white male vote is to play the game as rough as the president. Bill Carrick, an adviser to Sen. Bob Kerrey, vows there will be no more Democratic \"weenie\" campaigns. On economic issues, says Clinton adviser Greer, Democrats will speak to the traditional male role as \"family provider\"-and argue that the Reagan-Bush years have made it much harder to provide. Clinton and Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, as Southerners, invoke the language of the traditional PC culture. Kerrey, with his record of military valor, has his own route into the white male heartland. Jerry Brown, scheduled to announce candidacy this week, seeks to tap into anger with Washington. Joining many Republicans, he now favors legislative term limits.\n\nBut Republicans are plotting to wed voter disgust with Congress-over pay raises, bounced checks and the Thomas hearings--to a cultural attack on Washington itself. They will seek to portray the Democratic-controlled Congress as the epicenter of the thinking they believe white males abhor. Expect to hear about a Capitol Hill crawling with \"radical feminists\" and \"liberals who tried to lynch Clarence Thomas,\" predicts GOP strategist Shirley.\n\nIn other words, expect a campaign that will make 1988 look tame.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nAmerican students attending major research universities will be the country's future leaders, but they are likely to be more politically divided than in past generations.\n\nThese are the findings of a new Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) campus survey -an annual poll of tens of thousands of students with a goldmine of information on the demographics and political views of young Americans. What jumps out most from the survey is how important race, gender, religion and sexual identity is for their politics, and how unimportant their economic situation is. And because identity is more personal than economics, this suggests that political compromise will be even harder to achieve among the elite of tomorrow than it is today.\n\nLet's start with sexual orientation. 23 percent of students, including 28 percent of female students, identify as LGBT. In a number of liberal arts colleges such as Smith and Wesleyan, up to half the student body identifies as something other than heterosexual. Relatedly, fewer than 5 percent of students say they are conservative.\n\nConservative identity, heterosexual identity, and religious identity are tightly correlated, the survey found.\n\nWhere once most students identified as heterosexual and Christian, neither is true today. This big jump in the size of the LGBT and nonreligious groups over time has been accompanied by a steady rise in female and minority students. While minorities have always leaned Left, female undergraduates have moved in a dramatically liberal direction, shifting nearly 15 points to the left since 2004, according to comprehensive Higher Education Research Institute (HERI) data . Against this, whites, Christians and men have not participated in the Leftward shift to anything like the same extent.\n\nWhat this means is that female and minority students at universities-especially elite ones-seem to be increasingly diverging from women and minorities in the population more generally. According to the large-sample Cooperative Election Study (CCES) survey, minority females in the general public are 35 percent conservative and 31 percent liberal, while minority female students at top universities break a mere 9 percent conservative, with 64 percent liberal.\n\nConservative women and conservative minorities may be the most underrepresented groups on campus.\n\nOn the other hand, white male students who affiliate as Christian are more Republican than white male Christians in the general public. Whatever the force is that has pushed students Left seems to have mainly worked its magic on women, the nonreligious and minorities. It's had the opposite effect on white men.\n\nWhites who identify as Christian or conservative seem to be emerging as a self-conscious group on campus, clustering more toward certain colleges. What appears to be happening is that white conservatives in red states are opting to study at local flagship colleges while their white liberal counterparts spread more evenly across the nation's campuses. Most white conservative students on these campuses report that they have conservative parents, whereas a somewhat larger share of white liberals say they have different views from their parents.\n\nThe high school a student attends also matters. Nearly half of those who were homeschooled are conservative, compared to the average of 23 percent. On the other hand, school choice doesn't appear to make much difference to sexual orientation; LGBT and non-binary identification is as common among undergraduates who were homeschooled or went to parochial schools as it is among those who went to public or private school.\n\nThe main take away is this: The liberal slant of undergraduates, combined with America's politically-divided geography and the tendency for white Christian conservatives to remain in red state systems has resulted in many leading colleges having little to no political diversity. Liberal arts colleges like Smith or Wesleyan are essentially liberal monocultures, while the share of conservatives in the Ivy League is only 10-15 percent. The De Santises and Hawleys are few and far between.\n\nAt the other end of the scale, even right-leaning red state colleges such as BYU, Clemson or Texas A&M are at least 30 percent liberal and less than 50 percent conservative. In fact, there are just a dozen-odd campuses where conservative students outnumber liberals. Only Hillsdale College is resoundingly right-wing, at around 80 percent conservative and 10 percent liberal.\n\nThe highest viewpoint diversity is in red state flagship colleges like the University of Arkansas, which has the most even mix of liberal and conservative, Democratic and Republican, students in the country. The data also suggests that debate is more open at places like the University of Arkansas than in most top U.S. colleges.\n\nThe message for students is clear: A century ago, intellectuals from small midwestern towns sought out the freewheeling intellectual environments of major East Coast universities. Today, those who hanker after the free exchange of ideas should seek out the heartland.\n\nUnfortunately for the rest of us, polarization may get a lot worse when these students graduate.\n\nEric Kaufmann is a professor of Politics at Birkbeck College, University of London and is affiliated with the Manhattan Institute and the Center for the Study of Partisanship and Ideology .\n\nThe views in this article are the writer's own.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nIn most respects, the cocktail party in an elegant Capitol Hill apartment last week was a typical gathering of ambitious young Republicans. Lawyers, Senate staffers and bureaucrats munched hors d'oeuvres in honor of Reagan administration alumnus Armstrong Williams's new public-relations business. What made this get-together noteworthy, however, was that nearly all those in attendance were African-Americans, members of a nascent network of \"black conservatives\" whose views differ dramatically from those of civil-rights organizations. The group's hero was being introduced on TV that night: Clarence Thomas, Supreme Court nominee and apostle of black self-reliance. Says Williams, 31, who worked for Sen. Strom Thurmond before moving to Thomas's Equal Employment Opportunity Commission: \"We don't see ourselves as the new civil-rights leaders. Our movement is for one thing--economic empowerment.\"\n\n\"Movement\" is probably too grandiose a word to describe the ranks of those critics of the civil-rights paradigm who are labeled, with varying degrees of accuracy, \"black conservatives.\" The vast majority of black American voters remain liberal Democrats. But Thomas's nomination has propelled a once dismissed brand of African-American political thought to new national prominence. \"No longer will one group take for granted the entire black community,\" says Claudia Butts, deputy director of the conservative Heritage Foundation's New Majority Project, the think tank's minority outreach program.\n\nConservative notions of self-help trace their origins all the way back to Booker T. Washington. In some ways, they even converge with the separatist doctrines of left-wing figures such as Malcolm X, whom Thomas admired as a college student. Says Atlanta attorney Larry Thompson: \"I think the core of [Thomas's] beliefs is we can't simply preach on and on that all we have to do is get more assistance from the government. It may be a nationalistic argument more than anything else.\" Economists Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams and Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise have long argued for policies such as workfare and tenant ownership of public-housing projects (box) that are designed to end the dependency of the black poor on government. In his provocative book, \"The Content of Our Character,\" Shelby Steele argued blacks must shed their \"victim focused\" identity-and that racial preferences in hiring and admissions can undermine black self-confidence.\n\nThe increasing visibility of black critics of the liberal agenda is largely due to the growth of the black middle class (itself partly a consequence of affirmative action), which has given significant numbers of blacks a stake in free enterprise. At the same time, the plight of black inner-city dwellers has worsened, creating a sense that government programs haven't helped the poorest blacks. The Democrats' failure to win the White House has led some blacks to question the benefits of loyalty to one party. Says Republican J. C. Watts Jr., 33, Oklahoma Corporation commissioner and the first African-American ever elected to statewide office in Oklahoma: \"One of the reasons I'm not a Democrat is that [people] feel I have to be a Democrat because I'm black.\" Reagan conservatives, especially the late Republican national chairman Lee Atwater, sought to capitalize on such trends by fostering the careers of young black officials such as Thomas, Connecticut Rep. Gary Franks and former State Department official Alan Keyes.\n\nThe list of blacks who have distanced themselves from conventional liberalism is by no means exclusively Republican. Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder, the nation's first elected black governor, supports the civil-rights bill, but has joined the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, slashed his state's budget and called for abstinence as a solution to drug abuse and teen pregnancy in the ghetto. Wayne Bryant, Democratic majority leader of the New Jersey Legislature, has proposed a bill that would require welfare applicants to finish school or complete job training-or risk a cut in benefits. Says Bryant: \"The Democrats have got to be able to cut out something old that's failed.\"\n\nBryant and Wilder chafe at the label conservative.\" So do Steele and intellectuals like Glenn Loury of Harvard and Stephen Carter of Yale Law School, all of whom have published eloquent, highly personal essays on the hidden costs of racial preferences in hiring and promotion. While not against affirmative-action programs that equalize the opportunities of blacks and whites, they argue that preferential treatment to achieve \"equality of result\" is counterproductive-in part because the benefits go mostly to middle-class blacks, not poor blacks who need governmental attention the most. Carter, whose book \"Reflections of an Affirmative Action Baby\" will be published this fall, argues that granting positions to blacks in the name of diversity may actually force them to represent a single black perspective that doesn't necessarily exist. \"There is no one way to be black,\" he says.\n\nTo their harshest black critics, Republicans and scholars like Steele, Loury and Carter are \"Uncle Toms.\" NAACP president Benjamin Hooks once called Loury \"treasonous.\" In an interview with Playboy, film director Spike Lee said that Michael Williams, the Bush administration official who triggered controversy by announcing that minority-only scholarships at colleges receiving federal aid were illegal (the ruling was later watered down), \"should be beat with a Louisville Slugger in an alley.\" Such rhetoric, black conservatives say, silences African-Americans who might otherwise agree with them.\n\nYet civil-rights leaders say they aren't as rigidly opposed to self-help as their conservative critics have alleged-sometimes in rhetoric no less provocative than the left's. In recent years, black leaders such as Hooks and John Jacob of the Urban League have sounded the self-help theme, which has also been a staple of Jesse Jackson's message. And the prominence of African-American conservatives often owes more to the patronage of like-minded whites than it does to grass-roots support from blacks. Many, such as Thomas, were not elected, but are political appointees. Of 436 black state legislators in the country, only three are Republican. All too often, white conservatives have been perfectly happy to put forth black critics of affirmative action, while aiming racially charged appeals at white voters. No one has condemned this more eloquently than Clarence Thomas himself. In a 1987 lecture at the Heritage Foundation, he chided Reagan conservatives for supporting tax credits for segregated Bob Jones University: \"Often it seemed that to be accepted within the conservative ranks and to be treated with some degree of acceptance, a black was required to become a caricature of sorts, providing sideshows of antiblack quips and attacks.\"\n\nBlack conservatives, noting that African-American views on social issues such as school prayer and abortion are often conservative, insist their philosophy is more in tune with traditional black values than liberalism is. They say skepticism toward big government is the logical heritage of African-Americans. \"If our forebears could achieve in hostile climates, amid lynchings and an oppressive government, then surely we don't need government,\" says Woodson. \"It's like the victim waiting for the mugger to come back and pick him up.\" David Bositis, senior research associate at the predominantly black Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, counters that on issues African-Americans rate as most important-affirmative action and government-supported health care-they favor government action.\n\nIn fact, both traditions are deeply rooted: American history is full of examples-slavery and Jim Crow, to name just two-in which government has been used as an instrument of oppression of blacks. But from the Reconstruction-era Freedmen's Bureau to the War on Poverty it has also been used as an instrument of their advancement. In that sense, the debate among blacks over the proper degree of government intervention extends a similar debate that America as a whole has been waging since independence. Despite the efforts of some blacks to condemn conservatives-and despite the media's failure to portray the full range of black opinion-political ferment is the historical norm among African-Americans. In a political climate increasingly hostile to their traditional agenda, civil-rights leaders may soon find themselves drawn deeper into dialogue with the critics in their midst.\n\nMost black conservatives share a common set of beliefs centered on the notion of black self-help. Challenging the traditional liberal model of government-based solutions to racial and economic problems, their basic agenda calls for:\n\nBlack conservatives argue that affirmative action cheapens blacks' true accomplishments and fosters resentment among whites. Some argue that affirmative-action or set-aside programs shouldn't be abolished altogether, but should be based on class-- not race.\n\nBig-ticket social programs stifle free enterprise in minority communities, conservative black economists contend. They prefer tax breaks for minority-owned small businesses and for corporations that invest in inner cities. Welfare, black conservatives say, should be a benefit linked to jobs or training programs, the so-called workfare approach, and not regarded as an entitlement.\n\nConservative blacks support programs that turn over government duties to private hands. Two favorite schemes: HUD Secretary Jack Kemp's program for tenant ownership of public housing and vouchers for private-school education.\n\nAlan Keyes, director of Citizens Against Government Waste, says conservatives want to foster \"traditionally black values: family, self-reliance, self-restraint\" to end social ills like drug use, teen pregnancy and fatherless households. Others note that many blacks share a concern for customarily rightwing issues, such as school prayer and crime control.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nA Texas Republican is calling for fellow party members to become politically intolerant amid concerns that Tarrant County, the largest Republican county in the state, could turn blue during the 2020 election. The post, authored by Fredrick Hambright, was posted to the Tarrant County Tea Party website in mid-July , apparently prompted by a ruling made in June by the Tarrant County Commissioners Court. The ruling allowed the program known as 287(g) to continue in Tarrant County, something which Hambright says was spurred by Republicans making their voices heard.\n\n287(g) is named after Section 287(g), which is part of the Immigration and Nationality Act . The program allows members of law enforcement to be deputized as federal immigration agents and to ask those in custody basic questions to determine their immigration status. Several versions of the program exist, and it is unclear which model Tarrant County law enforcement groups employ.\n\n\"Estimates by Pew and Yale put the total number of illegal aliens in DFW between 475,000 and 875,000. According to Sheriff Waybourn, 287(g) led to the deportation of just 500 criminal aliens in 2018. But Republicans can learn something from this event. Some subtle indicators give a summary of HOW and WHY progressivism has dominated our discourse and taken our country into this brave new world. A world where clowns reign supreme,\" Hambright wrote.\n\n\"If a change does not happen soon in the Tarrant County Republican Party, those who oppose the leftist agenda will see the loss of Tarrant County to the Democrats forever. The same thing happened in California that is now happening here and our leadership is walking us down the same failed path to political annihilation the California GOP suffered,\" he continued, going on to say that Republicans have \"already accepted defeat.\"\n\nThe lengthy post goes on to highlight how American politics have gradually shifted to the left, citing the '90s sitcom Friends and jokes made on the show about homosexuality. \"A few years later, Texas voted on homo marriage and said resoundingly 'yeah, thanks but no thanks.' Then suddenly, those gay jokes were no longer acceptable on TV. Then the Supreme Court , apparently believing Hollywood was an expression of reality, forced this idea of a same-sex marriage upon us without any reasonable legal rationale whatsoever, simply alluring to 'changed attitudes' of the public with no proof,\" Hambright said.\n\nHambright added that most illegal immigrants will admit they have come to the United States \"for political conquest,\" and that conservatives will lose elections in Tarrant County because \"right-wing conservatives operating within the left-wing's moral framework.\"\n\nConcerns about a political shift in Texas have been well-founded as traditional Republican strongholds in the Dallas-Forth Worth metro have flipped from red to blue. Tarrant County, home to roughly 2.054 million people, is the last red county in the metroplex and had been a Republican stronghold for 35 years until Democrat Beto O'Rourke narrowly defeated incumbent Republican Ted Cruz to turn the area blue in November 2018.\n\n\"I think it's the writing on the walls. From the 2016 cycle to now, Tarrant has been making major moves to move the needle,\" Marco Rosas Jr., executive director for the Tarrant Democratic Party told the Forth Worth Star-Telegram when asked about Hambright's post.\n\nJulie McCarty, the president of the Tarrant County Tea Party, told the Star-Telegram that she found Hambright's post to be \"thought-provoking.\"\n\n\"We need to quit playing by the Left's playbook. The No. 1 thing any activist in Tarrant talks about is the fear of Tarrant turning blue. It's a very real concern,\" McCarty told the newspaper. \"In fact, it's a very real concern for the whole state because everyone knows how significant that would be.\"\n\nA poll conducted in June by the Texas Tribune indicates that Texas could indeed become a swing state for the 2020 presidential election. Individuals polled were split 50-50 about reelecting President Donald Trump for another term, with 39 percent saying they would \"definitely\" vote for Trump again, while 43 percent said they would \"definitely not\" cast a ballot for him.\n\nEleven percent said they would \"probably\" vote for Trump, while 7 percent responded to say \"probably not.\"\n\nIn his post, Hambright argues that part of the trend that could turn Texas purple is that Republicans cannot argue that progressivism is bad, \"because in many ways they subscribe to leftist views.\"\n\n\"They cannot say that allowing unlimited people from Latin America who will vote left wing at a rate of 66 percent to come here and politically disenfranchise white conservatives (the ONLY group that votes majority Republican) is bad in itself. We don't need to justify acting in our own self-interests to ANYONE. Have we accepted that we aren't allowed to preserve our culture and way of life because, what? Racism?,\" he writes.\n\n\"We need Republicans who are calling for the deportation of all illegals, the DACA babies, the anchor babies, & more! We need this not because it's most likely to succeed, but because it will move the needle away from the 500 illegals we are currently debating to a more favorable debate for Republicans and America. We cannot tear down our radicals. This is how we position ourselves to advance our cause. As the largest Republican county in America, we should be the leader in this effort if we are serious,\" Hambright said.\n\nHambright, whose biography on the post lists him as a lifelong Tarrant County resident, also writes that Republicans cannot run elections \"against socialism\" or the party will lose.\n\n\"Likewise, if simply complain or ridicule ideas we see as foolish, we will lose,\" he says. \"To stop the advancement of leftism, we must take advantage of the first law of politics: we must be intolerant of progressivism. All of it. Total intolerance is how progressives moved the country so far left. Beyond left field and into outer space.\"\n\n\"Let's finish what Trump started and capitalize on the yearning for an American Nationalist party and put these Bolsheviks in their place. We must look to the future and not just offer criticisms, but offer the American people a strong vision of sanity for our increasingly insane country.\"\n\nWhen asked by the Star-Telegram about Hambright's calls for an American Nationalist Part, McCarty said she doesn't believe there is a need for a new party \"at this point in time.\"\n\nMcCarty told the newspaper that the point of Hambright's post \"is that Republicans should take a lesson from the Progressives and never compromise on anything. Progressives never do. Conservative politicians always do.\"\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

      "text": "Q&A: America's Political Divide\n\nBased on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nWhy does every election leave the country holding its collective breath? Why have campaigns become more bitter, even with increasing numbers of voters who identify with neither party? According to political scientists Earl Black and Merle Black in their new book, \"Divided America: The Ferocious Power Struggle in American Politics\" (Simon & Schuster), neither Democrats nor Republicans, neither conservatives nor liberals represent governing majorities in the United States. The parties, they write, \"are locked in a power struggle in which victory or defeat is possible in every round of elections for every national institution.\" NEWSWEEK's Karen Breslau spoke with Merle Black, professor of politics and government at Emory University (and the twin brother of Earl Black, a professor of political science at Rice University), about his findings. Excerpts:\n\nNEWSWEEK: You paint a picture of an America that is almost hopelessly polarized. How did the country end up in this impasse? Merle Black: The parties have become more ideologically homogenous than ever before. The Democrats are more liberal than in the past. The Republicans are more conservative than they've ever been before. Each party has over time carved out regional strongholds, which means they have to appeal to voters in those strongholds, rather than at a national level. The parties can survive in their bases because they promote candidates who reflect the beliefs and priorities of the voters in a regional stronghold.\n\nThis goes back to the realignment of white conservatives during the Reagan presidency. Historically, those voters were aligned with the conservative wing of the Democrats. But the realignment of these voters in the South produced a much more conservative Republican Party, [that] not only moved Republicans to the right, but also made it a more religiously conservative party. Today only 24 percent of Southern whites call themselves Democrats. When the Democrats lost what had been their historically conservative wing, the party moved to the left.\n\nAnd moderates seem to be left out of the picture. You write about elections becoming \"continuous battles between ideologically driven partisans-who represent minorities of the entire electorate.\" The groups that become very strong within a particular party can leverage the party. You don't need to own 50 percent of the stock in a company to have an enormous impact under our winner-take-all rules, where there is no proportional representation. Unless that middle group [comprised of] moderate voters from the Democratic and Republican parties can win an election, it gets nothing.\n\nIsn't your book just another way of talking about Red States and Blue States? We don't talk about those concepts or use that language in the book. What we see is that partisan strongholds are related to race and ethnicity of voters but also rooted to religious cultures. Where you have large numbers of conservative Protestants, you generally see a Republican stronghold.\n\nWith conservative Christian voters dominating in the South and more secular liberal voters dominating in the Northeast and the Pacific Coast? That's right. There are of course variations within the regions, but what is striking is how homogeneous the regions tend to be.\n\nAre there any areas of the country that are still up for grabs? We still see a lot of that in the Midwest. That's the one region where the strength of Democrats and Republicans has gone back and forth. In other regions, what we see from 2006 is that the Democrats got bigger majorities in their strongholds, the Northeast and the Pacific Coast, than ever before. The Republicans continue to be strong in the South, but their majorities were not as large as the Democrats majorities in their respective strongholds.\n\nWhat does this suggest for the 2008 presidential election? All the Democrats need to do is hold the states they did last time and win Ohio. The extremely close results of 2006 suggest that Ohio is up for grabs.\n\nSo the new mantra is Ohio, Ohio, Ohio instead of Florida, Florida, Florida? That's right [laughs]. But there are also other states where Democrats have additional opportunities, most notably in the West-Colorado, Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico. There's a Western culture where the Democrats have had considerable support in part from the New Deal on. These are rapidly growing states with changing populations. The voters are slightly less conservative than they've been in the past, and there is a lot more participation by what we call the \"new minorities,\" primarily Latinos. It's very interesting that Democrats will hold their nominating convention in Colorado. They are clearly trying to challenge the Republicans stronghold on the Western states. That would be especially true if Bill Richardson were to be the vice presidential nominee.\n\nBecause he's Hispanic and the governor of New Mexico? Right.\n\nAnd who has crossover appeal on the Republican side? If Giuliani could survive the Republican primary process, he'd put several states in the Northeast, the Democrats' most reliable stronghold, into play. And possibly McCain, although I should say the McCain of 2000 would have some appeal for voters not aligned with a particular party.\n\nAnd Hillary? She looks more like a base candidate who'd be strong in Democratic regions, but it's unclear how she would advance in Republican regions. With Hillary from New York and Obama from Illinois, both Democratic strongholds, either would have to find a way to appeal to voters in a Republican stronghold.\n\nIn the book, you suggest that \"every institution is up for grabs, in every election.\" It sounds like good news for political consultants, but what does it mean for everyone else? [Laughs.] We are just trying to provide a realistic picture of American politics. It makes it very, very hard to govern the United States-and very hard to be president. The party in the minority is only one or two issues from becoming majority. That gives them no incentive to compromise. And the majority party is always looking over their shoulders.\n\nNewsletters in your inbox See all\n\nCompany\n\nEditions:\n\nContact\n\nTerms of Use\n\n© 2025 NEWSWEEK DIGITAL LLC"

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nArkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, addressed continued skepticism about the COVID-19 vaccines among conservatives-asserting that this \"resistance and obstinance\" needs to be addressed.\n\nPolling from ABC News and The Washington Post released last weekend showed that about 20 percent of Americans say they will not get vaccinated against the novel virus. The percentage is substantially higher among those identifying as Republicans (close to 40 percent) and white conservatives (more than a third).\n\nDuring a Sunday interview with ABC News' This Week , Hutchinson was asked about this skepticism among Republicans and conservatives.\n\n\"There shouldn't be a partisan divide first of all. But, clearly, conservative is more hesitant about government authority. That's just the nature of it. And so, I think in the Southern states and some rural states, you have that more conservative approach, skepticism about government,\" the Republican governor responded.\n\nHutchinson argued that \"skepticism and mistrust\" could be overcome with \"truth.\" He said that society needs to \"overcome resistance and obstinance with saying it's important for our community, and it's important for the health of our state and nation.\"\n\n\"I think that's simply the nature of different views of government. We've got to overcome that mistrust because it-Republicans, Democrats , we all suffer the same consequence if the Delta variant hits us and we're not vaccinated,\" Hutchinson added.\n\nThe GOP governor defended President Joe Biden during the interview as well. The president faced backlash from conservatives last week after they mischaracterized remarks he made about encouraging the public to get vaccinated.\n\n\"We need to go community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood, and oftentimes door to door, literally knocking on doors, to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus,\" Biden said.\n\nSome conservatives claimed that the president was advocating for federal agents to knock on doors and force people to get vaccinated . In reality, Biden was talking about sending people to provide information about the vaccines in hopes of addressing some of the skepticism, as well as providing vaccinations to those who accept them.\n\nHutchinson noted that his state was already working in a similar way to encourage more vaccinations.\n\n\"Long before President Biden said that, we have community organizations that's helping us. We have churches that are going into homes. We have people that go in to those that are bedridden so that they can have access to the vaccine,\" the Arkansas governor explained.\n\n\"There's nothing dramatic about what the president said in itself. No one wants an agent knocking on a door. But we do want those that do not have access otherwise to make sure they know about it and having the information,\" he added.\n\nAlthough Republicans-and particularly white conservatives-remain hesitant and skeptical about the COVID-19 vaccines, conservative leaders have repeatedly urged the public to get the jab. Former President Donald Trump has said publicly on multiple occasions that the vaccine is safe and effective, touting its rapid development as a signature achievement of his administration.\n\nSimilarly, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , a Kentucky Republican, and many other top Republicans have urged all Americans to get the readily available and lifesaving jabs. Prominent Evangelical Christian leader Franklin Graham, CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and of Samaritan's Purse, has done multiple interviews to assure skeptical conservatives that the vaccines are safe, saying they are \"going to save life.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out to Hutchinson's press office for further comment.\n\nJason Lemon is a Senior Politics Editor at Newsweek based in Brooklyn, New York.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nWhite nationalist organizer Billy Roper says the job of recruiting people to his cause-building a white ethnostate-starts with something as mundane as a trip to Walmart.\n\n\"I could be at the grocery store and be next to someone at the produce aisle and simply say, 'Wow, can you believe the price of produce these days?'\" he tells Newsweek of the way he starts conversations on the subject in his hometown of Mountain View, Arkansas. The Southern Poverty Law Center calls Roper \" the uncensored voice of violent neo-Nazism . \"\n\nHis \"agitation\" technique-highlighting shared grievances in an effort build up feelings of solidarity for a political cause-would be familiar to any labor organizer. But in an era in America when union participation is declining, inequality is widening and mistrust of authority is spreading, Roper and others are building alliances not based on shared economic interest but on the color of human flesh. Referring to the range of tolerated ideas in public discourse, he says President Donald Trump's election helped \"shift the Overton window far enough to the right\" for him to make new inroads.\n\nEnter Colin Kaepernick. The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback helped launch an influential protest movement over America's treatment of people of color that has gone on for two NFL seasons now, spreading across teams throughout the league. The protest movement has been harshly condemned by President Donald Trump and by Vice President Mike Pence, who walked out of an Indianapolis Colts game on Sunday because he \"would not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our national anthem.\" He said that even as white nationalists, neo-Nazis and other elements on the extreme far-right are actively swooping in to exploit feelings of anger in Trump's base, in an effort to ramp up their organizations, according to online propaganda and multiple sources who spoke to Newsweek .\n\nI left today's Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.\n\n\"We all have tribal instincts that we need to sublimate through sports, but now politics has overtaken the game,\" Roper says of the NFL protests. \"My bet is that when politics is on the field, whites will choose to identify with the white uniform they were born with.\"\n\nRoper's comment will undoubtedly sicken civil rights activists like Kaepernick, who have been warning of the threat of white supremacy in the United States long before Trump made his now infamous \"both sides\" remark about that violence that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August. But his words help give an indication of how white nationalists seek to radicalize passive white conservatives-\"normies,\" as they're sometimes called by members of the so-called alt-right-and turn them into people willing to actively fight against things that many take for granted, like the social integration of different races in America.\n\nRichard Spencer, whose name and face have become ubiquitous with the white nationalist movement , tells Newsweek about how the NFL has opened up avenues of recruitment. \"Kaepernick explicitly said this about race: The people who gravitate to flag waving and that sort of kitsch are usually white people. So, we will gladly take on those symbols\" for the white nationalist movement.\n\nPropagandists for the white nationalist cause are now adapting the rhetoric they use to frame the cultural debate around issues of patriotism. A white nationalist rally scheduled for December in Charlotte, North Carolina, which was ultimately canceled over security concerns, was billed as the \"March Against Communism,\" for example. Vanguard America, a white nationalist organization, has formed a group called \"Patriot Front\" in recent months, according to antifascist activist Kit O'Connell, who noted to Newsweek that the group had stripped itself of some of the more overtly fascist symbols it employed in favor of more traditional images associated with Americana.\n\nThe Daily Stormer, a millennial-geared neo-Nazi propaganda website that filters its retelling of cultural events through the lens of Editor Andrew Anglin's paranoia about Jews , hatred of non-whites and entry-level appreciation of hipster culture, has published several posts suggesting that believers in \"alt-right\" politics adopt a banner of \"American Nationalism\"-a phrase intended to underscore the degree to which Anglin believes black NFL players and leftists lack patriotism.\n\n\"We now have the ability to rally all whites who do not agree to surrender their identity as an American around the ideology we have formed as the Alt-Right,\" Anglin, an open admirer of Adolph Hitler, writes about the NFL protests. \"This is the moment we've been waiting for. We can be the carriers of the torch of the American nation and ride in, draped in the flag, as saviors of the people. Saving from the alien Jew and his evil hordes of brown invaders. The people will have no choice. We're going to be the only ones there to defend them.\"\n\nThis deliberately divisive rhetoric is nothing new, according to Joshua Rothman, professor and chairman of the Department of History at the University of Alabama.\n\n\"If we look back on white reactions in America to black protests of any kind,\" Rothman tells Newsweek of the NFL protest movement, \"there are many white people who just find it unacceptable.\"\n\nRothman notes that the KKK employed similar rhetoric to recruit members during the civil rights era. So did the John Birch Society, a far-right conservative advocacy group that places a strong emphasis on communist conspiracies.\n\n\"Being explicitly pro-Nazi has a narrow appeal for the far right,\" Rothman notes. \"So, some conservatives do get sucked in on these ideas and end up being shocked\" at what the people around them really believe.\n\nThe phenomenon creates headaches for civil rights activists and those on the other side of the political spectrum who sometimes struggle to make inroads with the kind of white men being targeted for recruitment by white nationalists. The way to counter it, according to leftists with whom I spoke, is to appeal to people's economic interests, rather than engage into a heated argument about patriotism.\n\nR.L. Stephens, a writer, organizer, and member of the Democratic Socialists of America National Political Committee, tells Newsweek that the framing of the cultural debate is misleading, and suggests that people like Spencer are more interested in power than helping whites.\n\n\"Richard Spencer's most important identity isn't white. It's landowner. He and his family own cotton fields in Louisiana and have received over $2 million in farm subsidies from the federal government. He does not care about flags, and frankly he doesn't truly care about white people either,\" Stephens opines, noting that 10 percent of white households in America live on less than $15,000 a year.\n\nShuja Haider, an editor for the left-leaning Viewpoint Magazine , says that to combat tactics like the ones described by Roper and others, activists on the other side of the debate have to fight for something, rather than simply against white nationalism.\n\n\"I think that in politics, you can't skip the step of arguing the affirmative,\" he adds. \"It's not enough to be against inequality. You have to be for equality, otherwise you aren't standing up for anything at all.\"\n\nPrior to joining Newsweek as a politics writer, Michael wrote crime features for VICE , served as a special correspondent during the Nepal earthquake for Los Angeles Times, and contributed climate change reporting to National Geographic magazine.\n\nHis work has also been featured in The New York Times , Slate , Foreign Policy , ABC News , and The Wall Street Journal, among other publications.\n\nHe's a three time grantee of the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, and graduated from the Iowa Writer's Workshop (Playwriting) in 2007.\n\nPrior to joining Newsweek as a politics writer, Michael wrote crime features for VICE , served as a special correspondent during the Nepal earthquake for Los Angeles Times, and contributed climate change reporting to National Geographic magazine.\n\nHis work has also been featured in The New York Times , Slate , Foreign Policy , ABC News , and The Wall Street Journal, among other publications.\n\nHe's a three time grantee of the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, and graduated from the Iowa Writer's Workshop (Playwriting) in 2007.\n\nPrior to joining Newsweek as a politics writer, Michael wrote crime features for VICE , served as a special correspondent during the Nepal                                    ...

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe 2020 census results described a rapidly growing multiracial population in the United States, but two sociologists from Princeton University argue that the public was misled.\n\nThey say the dramatic jump, with a significant increase in multiracial individuals reported since 2010, was an illusion rather than a genuine demographic shift.\n\nCensus Bureau officials told Newsweek the updated federal standards are designed to treat all groups \"co-equally.\"\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nThe official count of multiracial individuals holds significant weight, influencing decisions on redrawing political districts, enforcing civil rights, compiling labor and health statistics, and distributing federal funding. This issue gained further prominence while Vice President Kamala Harris , the daughter of a Jamaican father and an Indian mother, launched her campaign as the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, placing multiracial identity squarely in the national spotlight.\n\nThe reported 276 percent surge in the multiracial population between 2010 and 2020 was driven primarily by changes in how the U.S. Census Bureau classified individuals, according to a paper published last month by Princeton sociologists Paul Starr and Christina Pao.\n\nFor the first time, the Census Bureau allowed respondents to write in their families' origins on the census form, a shift that directly influenced how the agency categorized racial and ethnic identities. \"The procedure was misleading, and the public was misled about the extent of racial change,\" said Starr in an email to The Associated Press.\n\nThe percentage of Americans classified as two or more races rose dramatically from 2.9 percent in 2010 to 10.2 percent in 2020, with the increase being especially pronounced among Hispanic individuals.\n\nMeanwhile, the share of the white alone population declined significantly, dropping from 72.4 percent to 61.6 percent. This shift has sparked debate, including criticism from conservative commentators, who have framed the decline as a perceived erosion of white power.\n\nStarr and Pao found a computerized algorithm used in the 2020 census was a major factor in the apparent multiracial population boom. According to their analysis, individuals who marked themselves as Black or white but also indicated Latin American origins were automatically reclassified as multiracial, even if they identified with only one race. Similarly, those who identified as white but noted African origins were also reclassified, contributing to the inflated multiracial figures.\n\nWhen the 2020 census data was unveiled in mid-2021, Census Bureau officials described the updated classification method as a significant improvement, better reflecting the complexities of racial and ethnic identity in the modern era. However, they also admitted that some of the dramatic growth in the multiracial population was likely a direct result of these methodological changes.\n\nPrinceton sociologists Paul Starr said in an email \"The 2020 census produced a sudden jump in the multiracial count and a precipitous decline in the count of the white population, contributing to an unwarranted panic among white conservatives about demographic change.\"\n\nAdvocate for multiracial representation in official statistics Susan Graham , said \"Was the 2020 Census subjected to a fictitious multiracial boom? Possibly,\" She added \"As always, answers only get more confusing when the federal government goes back and tries, one more time, to get it right.\"\n\nCensus Bureau officials said in response to Newsweek's request for comment \" Updated federal standards now require that race and ethnicity are asked in a combined question. The updated federal standards are designed to treat all groups co-equally, to encourage respondents to identify their races and/or ethnicities, and to ensure that the resulting data fully represent what respondents report.\"\n\nThe Princeton researchers argue that the Census Bureau conflated ancestry with identity and national origin with race in its 2020 methodology. They recommend the agency reconsider its approach, suggesting it abandon the use of \"origins\" as a factor in categorizing individuals to avoid further confusion and misrepresentation.\n\nThe federal government is revising its race and ethnicity categories, merging the questions into a single query rather than addressing them separately. Additionally, a new Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) category is being introduced, a shift expected to decrease the number of respondents identifying as white.\n\nThis article includes reporting from The Associated Press\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nMichael D.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nFox Business Network host Lou Dobbs and a former Trump senior adviser complained Tuesday that Mexico is attempting to interfere in the 2020 elections by allowing undocumented immigrants to \"invade\" the country and vote.\n\nSpeaking on his namesake program Tuesday evening, Dobbs and former President Donald Trump and George W. Bush adviser Christian Whiton said the federal government isn't taking border security seriously enough, claiming the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon aren't doing their part to stop Central American migrants from crossing the U.S. southern border. Dobbs claimed immigration is \"not a crisis for the Democratic Party\" because liberal leaders believe the migrants will vote against Trump in 2020.\n\nWhiton said Democrats are \"attempting to replace us,\" suggesting white conservatives are having their votes overshadowed by waves of liberal-leaning undocumented migrants.\n\n\"It is not a crisis for the Democratic Party, it is the arrival of highly targeted, highly prized and appreciated future voters for the Democratic Party, in their judgment at least,\" Dobbs said on the Fox Business Network Tuesday. \"[2020 voters should have] some concern over the extraordinary impact of illegal immigration, which might be construed as Mexican interference in our elections as they permit Mexican citizens and Central American citizens to cross illegally into the United States.\"\n\nActing U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan recently urged Congress to give federal authorities the ability to detain families together, which he said could be accomplished with just \"a few sentences of law.\" McAleenan also this week requested the legal authority to have unaccompanied children get \"repatriated safely.\"\n\nDobbs touted Trump's approval rating among Hispanics, saying Latino voters frequently vote for Republicans on the local, federal and state level. A Marist/NPR/PBS Poll released in January, and shared by Trump himself , showed Trump's approval rating among Latinos at 50 percent, a 19 percent increase from the previous year.\n\nHowever, the same survey also revealed 57 percent of registered Hispanic voters said they would \"definitely\" vote against Trump in 2020.\n\nWhiton, a Senior Fellow at the Richard Nixon-founded Center for National Interest strategy group, told Dobbs he doesn't think DHS or the Pentagon are working hard enough to secure the U.S. border. He lamented ongoing foreign conflicts in Afghanistan and Syria while there is an \"invasion\" at the country's southern border.\n\n\"Particularly the Pentagon, which in many ways never really joined the Trump administration,\" Whiton said. \"You have these generals who love their expeditionary operations, they're out in Syria, we've been in Afghanistan for 18 years, and we have a crisis on our own border, we have people invading our country and I would think that should be pretty high up-priority one, two, three, somewhere in there, and they seem completely oblivious.\"\n\nWhiton took two shots at U.S. allies in Europe, complaining during the segment about immigration problems across the Atlantic and taking a shot at Britain, Germany and France for not supporting Trump's recently expanded Iranian sanctions.\n\n\"We've seen in this in Europe we're seeing it here. They're attempting to replace us with citizens that they think, or future citizens, that they think would be more amenable to voting for them,\" Whiton said.\n\nDobbs wondered how Democrats plan to take on \"an already historic president\" and asked, \"has any incumbent president ever failed to win re-election with a record of achievement even close to that of President Trump?\"\n\nDobbs and Whiton expressed their shock at recent reports that Mexican military troops \"detained and disarmed\" U.S. troops on American soil last week. \"Wow,\" Dobbs exclaimed.\n\nWhiton continued, \"If you look actually at Latinos here legally, U.S. citizens, they're actually frankly, very similar to native-born Americans in their view of people ought to wait in line, there ought to be the rule of law, we cannot have open borders so I'm not sure this is going to work out the way the Democrats expect but that's what they're up to.\n\nDobbs, whose show is frequently watched by the president, tweeted Tuesday that Trump \"is fulfilling his pledge-he said we're getting out of the Iran deal & cranking up sanctions. We stopped issuing waivers & that takes away $2B a month for the Iranian regime. This is a big step.\" Both he and Whiton applauded Trump's tougher stance in regards to punishing other countries which trade with Iran.\n\n\"If you're doing business with Iran, going from 1.2 to 1.7 million barrels a day down to just a couple hundred-thousand through smuggling that takes away $2 billion per month from the Iranian regime,\" Whiton said, before taking a swipe at several European allies. \"So this is a pretty big deal, we're not getting any help from our friends in Europe: Britain, Germany and France working against us, but their companies are going to comply because they'd rather do business with us than Iran, and we might have to contend with some Chinese cheating, but this is a big step.\"\n\nBenjamin Fearnow is a reporter based out of Newsweek's New York City offices.

It appeared in the news section.\n\nToday, the Post noted a retraction. Or is it a \"clarification\"? After #MaskGate I have no idea how journalism works anymore.\n\nCLARIFICATION A previous version of this story imprecisely referred to Justice Clarence Thomas's opinions as often reflecting the thinking of White conservatives, rather than conservatives broadly. That reference has been removed.\n\nNow, the passage reads:\n\nRep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.), a friend and ally of Clyburn's for over 30 years, said even Clyburn's critics respect his political instincts and his connection with a valuable but often disappointed subset of Democratic voters.\n\n\"Nobody that I'm aware of feels that opposing Clyburn's nomination would be the wise thing to do,\" he said. \"If you know that a person has been vetted by Jim Clyburn, you know that person won't go to the court and end up being a Clarence Thomas,\" referring to the Black conservative justice .\n\nI appreciate the \"clarification,\" but this story is still problematic. Why is it relevant to this story that Thomas is Black? The reason why is that Thompson called Thomas an Oreo. The initial version of the story dutifully reported that statement as fact. Now, the Post merely alludes to the implication. This sort of casual racism against conservatives is embedded so deeply in progressive culture. WaPo reporters and editors simply treat these barbs as fact.\n\nFor posterity, the original is preserved here:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/fedjudges/status/1494129276710375424\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "The Second Amendment Is Not Restricted to White Conservatives\n\n2nd Amendment\n\nJacob Sullum | 7.29.2020 12:01 AM\n\nLast Saturday in Louisville, Kentucky, about 300 armed members of the NFAC (Not Fucking Around Coalition), a self-described \"black militia\" based in Atlanta, had what the Louisville Courier-Journal called \"a tense standoff\" with about 50 armed Three Percenters, which the paper described as a \"far-right...militia.\" While the incident, which ended without violence, could be seen as yet another sign that the country is descending into 1968-style chaos, it was also a striking illustration of the Second Amendment's enduring practical and symbolic importance that scrambled conventional stereotypes about the right to armed self-defense.\n\nSince Kentucky allows open (or concealed) carrying of firearms without a permit, the two groups, both of which disavow aggression, were acting lawfully. And while their motives may look different, both are drawing on a long American tradition of wide gun ownership as a safeguard against tyranny.\n\nNFAC members came to Louisville in support of protests provoked by the shooting of Breonna Taylor, an unarmed 26-year-old African-American woman who was killed by white police officers during a fruitless drug raid on March 13. The circumstances of Taylor's death gave the guns carried by those militia members added significance.\n\nPlainclothes police officers broke into Taylor's apartment in the middle of the night based on meager evidence that a detective used to obtain a no-knock search warrant. Mistaking the armed invaders for robbers, Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, grabbed a gun and fired a single shot that struck one officer in the leg.\n\nThe cops responded with a hail of bullets, at least eight of which struck Taylor and several of which entered a neighboring apartment. Prosecutors initially charged Walker with attempted murder of a police officer but dropped that charge in May.\n\nAs Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) observed last month, \"the invasion of a person's home is one of the most terrifying powers government possesses,\" and \"every person in a free society has the right to take arms against an intruder in their homes.\" While McClintock was emphasizing the dangers posed by no-knock warrants, his comments also raised the question of how Americans, no matter their skin color, can defend themselves against police officers who behave like criminals.\n\nNFAC has one answer. By parading with military-style rifles of the sort that Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, wants to ban , the militia's members show they are prepared to exercise the Second Amendment rights that gun control supporters typically portray as a fetish of white conservatives.\n\nThe assertion of those rights resonates historically, since modern gun control laws have their roots in the efforts of Southern states to disarm freedmen, depriving them of a constitutional right that Chief Justice Roger Taney, author of the Supreme Court's infamous 1857 decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford , warned black people would enjoy if they were recognized as citizens. Under Jim Crow and during the civil rights movement, the right to armed self-defense was vitally important to African Americans resisting government-imposed white supremacy.\n\nThe Three Percenters, by contrast, were responding to NFAC's presence in Louisville, aiming to \"aid police\" (as the Courier-Journal put it) in maintaining order. Yet the group, which rejects the \"militia\" label and disavows racism, also describes itself as defending civil liberties and resisting the illegitimate exercise of government power.\n\nYou need not endorse the tactics or ideologies of these organizations to recognize that both are relying on a legal legacy that makes mainstream Democrats like Biden uncomfortable. As the Supreme Court recognized in its landmark 2008 decision overturning the District of Columbia's handgun ban, the Second Amendment was based partly on the premise that \"when the able-bodied men of a nation are trained in arms and organized, they are better able to resist tyranny.\"\n\nThe fact that two opposing groups are dedicated to defending the right of armed self-defense should not be surprising. The Second Amendment, like the First, is of value to people with divergent backgrounds and political views. Gun controllers should stop pretending otherwise.\n\n© Copyright 2020 by Creators Syndicate Inc.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

Michelle Childs for the Supreme Court. Yet, some progressives are worried that she may be too moderate. The Washington Post wrote a lengthy article about Clyburn, and his influence on President Biden. The article contends that Childs is not moderate, but will make progressives happy. The Post quotes Rep. Bennie Thompson (the chair of the January 6 Commission) to assuage concerns about Childs on the left:\n\nRep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-Miss.), a friend and ally of Clyburn's for over 30 years, said even Clyburn's critics respect his political instincts and his connection with a valuable but often disappointed subset of Democratic voters. \"Nobody that I'm aware of feels that opposing Clyburn's nomination would be the wise thing to do,\" he said. \"If you know that a person has been vetted by Jim Clyburn, you know that person won't go to the court and end up being a Clarence Thomas,\" referring to the Black justice whose rulings often resemble the thinking of White conservatives .\n\nThe Washington Post wrote the emphasized portion. You know, Justice Thomas, the black justice who thinks like a white person. The Washington Post called Justice Thomas an Oreo. And that statement isn't even accurate! The Court's white conservatives issue rulings that often resemble those of Justice Thomas. Thomas is the intellectual leader of the Court's conservative wing. And he has been for decades. Gorsuch, Alito, and the rest are just trying to keep up with CT. But once again, we get the racist trope that Thomas is Scalia's clone. Just the opposite. Scalia often remarked that Thomas pushed him to the right. What lazy writing from the Post.\n\nDiscourse about race is upside and backwards. Racially-tinted sentiments about progressives are grounds for immediate cancellation. Racially-charged attacks about conservatives are offered as objective facts in a newspaper of record.\n\nThis article brings to mind an exchange between Justice Thomas and then-Senator Biden more than three decades ago.\n\nAnd from my standpoint as a black American, as far as I'm concerned, it is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves , to do for themselves, to have different ideas, and it is a message that unless you kowtow to an old order, this is what will happen to you. You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the U.S. -- U.S. Senate, rather than hung from a tree.\n\nJustice Thomas still deigns to think for himself, and refuses to kowtow to the old order run by Thompson and Clyburn. And for that reason, he continues to be destroyed by the left, without even the slightest hesitation.\n\nOh, and by the way, in 2005 then-Senator Biden threatened to filibuster then-Justice Janice Rogers Brown, who credibly could have (and should have) become the first black woman on the Supreme Court.\n\nFinally, the knives are out for Judge Childs. Consider this charge in Nina Totenberg's report :\n\nBorn in Detroit in 1966, she was 13 when her mother, a Michigan Bell telephone manager, moved the family to South Carolina. By then her mother and father had been divorced for some time. But within months of the move, the judge recalled in a 2018 speech, \"I received a phone call that my father, a police officer, had died in Detroit from gunshot wounds. Of course, I was devastated.\"\n\nBeyond that, little is publicly known about her father's death in 1980, except that the Associated Press reported at the time that that he \"died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest.\" Although Rep. James Clyburn, who has been aggressively lobbying for Childs' nomination, has said her father died \"in the line of duty,\" Ralph Childs is not on the Michigan state list of \"fallen officers\" in 1980.\n\nTotenberg \" in some form or another suggested \" that the story about Judge Childs's father's death may not be entirely accurate. Are we really going there? Critiquing Childs for not accurately characterizing the death of her father? Has anyone checked out Judge Childs's high school yearbook? She was valedictorian after all. Who knows what she wrote!? If only Michael Avenatti was free to help out. Maybe the prison library has some resources.\n\nThis process will get even uglier, very quickly.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "No Comprende, It's a Riddle\n\nPolitics\n\nDavid Weigel | 12.11.2007 5:27 PM\n\nThe best story you'll read this week is Ryan Lizza's on-the-trail portrait of \"Tancredoism\": its rise, its aftershocks, its impact on the GOP. It's a story that's been told before , of Republicans \"chasing a rabbit down a hole\" for dubious short-term gains and likely long-term disaster, but Lizza gets great stuff from the candidates themselves.\n\nWhen I asked Tancredo about Bush's argument that Republicans risked losing a generation of Hispanic voters if they adopted an immigration policy that many regard as nativist, he laughed and said, \"It doesn't seem to be holding its own very well, considering what happened the other night at the debate. If you think for a moment that Romney, Giuliani, and Thompson\"-Fred Thompson, the former Tennessee senator-\"haven't polled the heck out of this thing, you're wrong. They have. And they are there now because the polls tell them this is where they should be.\"\n\nSee the problem? Tancredo's confusing (or maybe just switching) the subject: Appealing to white conservatives in Iowa and New Hampshire and South Carolina has nothing to do with winning the growing Hispanic vote in the decreasingly red southwest. A Republican who pledges to put proximity mines on the border can make some gains with the tens of thousands of Iowans he needs to win a caucus, then lose the combined 30 electoral votes of Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and Colorado without setting foot in those states. Some tradeoff. John McCain comes off well in this discussion:\n\n\"It's the influx of illegals into places where they've never seen a Hispanic influence before,\" McCain told me. \"You probably see more emotion in Iowa than you do in Arizona on this issue. I was in a town in Iowa, and twenty years ago there were no Hispanics in the town. Then a meatpacking facility was opened up. Now twenty per cent of their population is Hispanic. There were senior citizens there who were-'concerned' is not the word. They see this as an assault on their culture, what they view as an impact on what have been their traditions in Iowa, in the small towns in Iowa. So you get questions like 'Why do I have to punch 1 for English?' 'Why can't they speak English?' It's become larger than just the fact that we need to enforce our borders.\"\n\nAnd related: E.J. Dionne explains why Republicans can still count on immigrant-bashing in mostly white suburban House seats.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "The Unbearable Whiteness of Being\n\nPolitics\n\nDavid Weigel | 1.18.2007 2:41 PM\n\nThe Hotline 's senior editor John Mercurio has a little smoke blown his way in a story about (among other things) whether Americans would elect a black president.\n\n[Black Democrat Robert] Ford said a national ticket featuring Obama in 2008 would be a significant drag on Democrats up and down state ballots, hurting the party as it struggles to hold slim majorities in Congress and pick up governor's offices in red states like Indiana and Missouri. He also said it would be unwinnable. \"He'd have to get 47 to 49 percent of the white vote in every state, and that's humanly impossible,\" Ford said, accusing Obama of falling prey to \"ego.\"\n\nHere's the problem with that: Forty-seven or 49 percent of the white vote would be unusually high for a Democratic candidate. That's more than any Democrat has racked up since Lyndon Johnson bellowed his way past Barry Goldwater 43 years ago.\n\nCheck out the exit polling for John Kerry, who came within one state of winning the presidency in 2004. Kerry, who's got a pigment defict that puts Obama to shame, lost the white vote to George Bush by 17 points. That was a big step down from Al Gore, who won the popular vote while losing the white vote by 10 points. And that number's only as high as it is because 44 percent of white women voted for Kerry. Only 37 percent of white men did.\n\nNone of this should controversial (although since the journalist who spends the most time studying it is Steve Sailer, so it is). We have two political parties. One unites white conservatives, moderates and center-rightists; the other unites white liberals with liberal and conservative minority groups. (The third parties are overwhelmingly white.) Neither party wins by turning out or converting minority voters. Three-quarters of the electorate is white, and Republicans win by getting more than 55 percent of the white vote, while Democrats win by getting more than 45 percent of it. If Obama got 49 percent of that vote, he'd be winning the biggest Democratic landslide in two generations - 56 or 57 percent of the popular vote, and probably more than 380 electoral votes. But the critical question is \"Can he get 45 percent of it?\" He got 66 percent of it in 2004, but he was running against Alan Keyes. Fun fact: That's 3 points better than Hillary Clinton did in 2006, running against a similarly pathetic (but white) candidate, John Spencer. Obama has a comfortable, emotional appeal to white voters, which makes him very dangerous for Republicans.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Behold the Democratic Future, Boasts Jonathan Chait, Because Suspicion of Government Is Racist\n\nPolitics\n\nJ.D. Tuccille | 4.23.2014 3:42 PM\n\nOver at New York Magazine , which today suffered a website crash that temporarily lowered Internet smug levels by a measurable degree, Jonathan Chait makes the bold claim that the Democratic Party is entering a period of dominance. His argument is partially rooted in favorable ethnic and generational trends that have much to do with the relative skills of the two major parties in enticing new voters-something that can confer a very real, but hardly permanent advantage. But Chait also proclaims victory for the donkey party because, he says, \"America's unique brand of ideological anti-statism is historically inseparable...from the legacy of slavery,\" and who wants anything to do with that?\n\nIt's tempting to say \"what the fuck?\" and take Chait's argument as an exercise in self-congratulatory lunacy-part of the attempt to declare an argument over, and further debate illegitimate -that has become so popular recently.\n\nBut Chait links to an earlier piece of his that is both more nuanced and very revealing of a hermetically sealed cultural and intellectual hothouse, one that can make it easy to assume a natural march to victory by his side and inevitable defeat for his opponents.\n\nIn \" The Color of His Presidency ,\" an analysis of the (alleged) racial politics undergirding support and opposition for the Obama administration, Chait acknowledged the limits of tying everything the right/Republicans (he tends to group people as \"Democrat\" and \"Republican\" and dismiss independents as really one or the other) do and believe to racism.\n\nYet here is the point where, for all its breadth and analytic power, the liberal racial analysis collapses onto itself. It may be true that, at the level of electoral campaign messaging, conservatism and white racial resentment are functionally identical. It would follow that any conservative argument is an appeal to white racism. That is, indeed, the all-but-explicit conclusion of the ubiquitous Atwater Rosetta-stone confession: Republican politics is fundamentally racist, and even its use of the most abstract economic appeal is a sinister, coded missive.\n\nImpressive though the historical, sociological, and psychological evidence undergirding this analysis may be, it also happens to be completely insane. Whatever Lee Atwater said, or meant to say, advocating tax cuts is not in any meaningful sense racist.\n\nChait then documents some of the more thoroughly dishonest attempts to attribute racist motives to conservatives, especially by MSNBC, whose commentators apparently see hidden hoods in every elephant lapel pin. He also discusses that network's special ability to get under thin GOP skin.\n\nAnd it's here that we go back off the rails, as we discover that the Republican Party is somehow no longer mainstream and part of American culture.\n\nIt exposed a sense in which their entire party is being written out of the American civic religion. The inscription of the civil-rights story into the fabric of American history-the elevation of Rosa Parks to a new Paul Revere, Martin Luther King to the pantheon of the Founding Fathers­-has, by implication, cast Barack Obama as the contemporary protagonist and Republicans as the villains.\n\nHe later adds:\n\nThe unresolved tension here concerns the very legitimacy of the contemporary Republican Party. It resembles, in milder form, the sorts of aftershocks that follow a democratic revolution, when the allies of the deposed junta-or ex-Communists in post-Iron Curtain Eastern Europe, or, closer to the bone, white conservatives in post-apartheid South Africa-attempt to reenter a newly democratized polity.\n\nChait then goes on to pseudo-scientifically do what he seemed to criticize just paragraphs earlier: link support for not just Republicans but also for small goverrnment ideas to America's history of slavery. He does this based on one study of political habits and history in counties of the Old South.\n\nAnd here we are again: No need for debate, it's all about internalized racism.\n\nWhat does this have to say about conservatives in New Hampshire or libertarians in Arizona? Who the hell knows.\n\nChait is very much a Red Team vs Blue Team thinker-deep down, you're one, or you're the other. He marinates at New York Magazine , among like-minded thinkers, for whom small government ideas and the Republican Party have largely been \"written out of the American civic religion.\" Everybody who disagrees is tainted by slavery in Mississippi.\n\nNever mind that the president's approval ratings are kind of crappy and below average compared to his predecessors, or that both major parties are viewed unfavorably by a majority of Americans . That civic religion may not have quite the saints or shrines that Chait assumes.\n\nThis is not to say that Republicans are incapable of their own very real bouts of stupidity. When it comes to nominating cringe-worthy candidates , the GOP is perfectly capable of fulfilling MSNBC's fever dreams. It often does seem firmly fixed in an unattractive authoritarian past, even as younger Americans are receptive to arguments about the size of government , the unworkability of Obamacare , and the superiority of private charity to government spending .\n\nCoupled with their tolerant social views, millennials would appear to be pointing more toward a libertarian future than a liberal or conservative one. If only one or both of the major parties would make a real play for that constituency.\n\nWhich is to say, if Republicans are capable of bouts of stupidity, so are liberal pundits.\n\nThe Rattler is a weekly newsletter from J.D.

      "text": "Internal Constraints\n\nPolicy\n\nCathy Young and Mike Lynch | From the October 2001 issue\n\nFew nonfiction books have had as immediate an impact on public debate as John H. McWhorter's Losing the Race: Self-Sabotage in Black America . Published last year by The Free Press, McWhorter's volume on race relations has won raves (\"the importance of... Losing the Race is difficult to overstate\" said the Weekly Standard ) and attacks (\"analytically weak...[and] irresponsible\" said Harvard Law School's Randall L. Kennedy). Whatever one's opinion of it, Losing the Race has become one of the most discussed books on the topic of race relations in recent years.\n\nThe genesis of McWhorter's book lies in his first childhood memory. It was 1968 and playtime in West Mount Airy, an integrated Philadelphia neighborhood. \"A group of black kids, none older than eight, asked me how to spell concrete ,\" writes McWhorter. \"I spelled it, only to have the 8-year-old bring his little sister to me and have her smack me repeatedly as the rest of the kids laughed and egged her on. From then on, I was often teased in the neighborhood for being 'smart.'\"\n\nMcWhorter managed to overcome the teasing, even if he was never really able to leave it behind. Educated at Rutgers and Stanford, he is, at 36, a tenured linguistics professor at the University of California at Berkeley, an accomplished actor in Bay Area theater, and, since the publication of his book a year ago, a huge (if controversial) hit on the lecture, panel, and cocktail party circuit. He's plenty confident that he's smart, and always has been. \"When I was five years old,\" McWhorter says over a glass of wine in a hotel bar separated from the White House only by Lafayette Park, \"I thought I was smarter than my teachers -- my white teachers -- and I would tell them so.\" (Perhaps it was a teacher who put the neighborhood children up to the slapping.)\n\nHe's also plenty confident that most other black Americans are smart. It disappoints him that they don't express their intelligence by achieving in school. \"In 1995,\" McWhorter writes, \"exactly 184 black students in the United States scored over 700 on the verbal portion of the SAT -- not even enough to fill a passenger plane.\"\n\nThe problem, argues McWhorter, is not a lack of black brain power or an excess of white racism. Rather, it's a dysfunctional black culture. Not just a \"ghetto culture\" that derides intellectual achievement, he insists, but mainstream, middle-, and even upper-class black culture. McWhorter identifies three self-destructive elements in contemporary black America: victimology, separatism, and anti-intellectualism. He spends 260 pages fleshing out these concepts, claiming the trio combine to keep black Americans from being the best they can be.\n\nMany liberal academics and commentators have pilloried McWhorter. The criticism has been particularly strong among black liberals. Time columnist Jack E. White, for instance, disparaged McWhorter as \"a hero for the black-bashing crowd,\" and accused him of peddling simplistic and damaging stereotypes. Other black columnists allow that he's on to something. In the Chicago Tribune , Clarence Page wrote that McWhorter \"hits the mark so often that I think we African-Americans can ignore him only at our peril -- especially we African-American parents.\"\n\nREASON columnist Cathy Young and national correspondent Michael Lynch sat down for an interview with McWhorter in June at the Hays-Adams Hotel in Washington, D.C., when he was in town to speak at a conference of the conservative group Empower America.\n\nREASON: Can you summarize the thesis of Losing the Race ?\n\nJohn McWhorter: Since the 1960s, black Americans have been encouraged to work under the misperception that residual racism is an obstacle to advancement. Racism remains in America, but in most cases, it is not an obstacle to people being the best that they can be. There is a cult of victimology that claims we remain victims on some cosmic level until there is no racism in any white person's heart or any instances of discrimination of any kind. That leads to a sense that being black is a thing apart from being a human being in the United States. That's what I call the cult of separatism, and the sense that black people are subject to different rules and the sense that black people are germane to certain subjects and not to others.\n\nThe separatism finally leads to the anti-intellectualism, a cultural disconnect from the school endeavor. Anti-intellectualism is, of course, an American problem. But with black people, there is a sense that knowledge for knowledge's sake is a \"white\" thing. Therefore, you're not culturally authentic as a black if you engage in it. This is why African-American students, regardless of class, tend to not do as well as others do on tests and in grades.\n\nREASON: You say that racism isn't an overriding obstacle. Do you think that white Americans underestimate the level of racism that still exists in American society?\n\nMcWhorter: Yes. It dismays me to hear some whites say, \"What do blacks have left to be complaining about? Slavery ended 150 years ago.\" Certainly that's not right. I talk about the subtle forms of racism in my book: Every time anybody tells me I'm articulate, it's technically racism, because I would not be told that if I were white. What they mean is, \"Blacks don't speak well, and you sound just like us.\"\n\nREASON: What about writers like Ellis Cose who document the daily indignities and make them the centerpiece of the black experience? Do you think there's anything helpful in that or is it self-sabotage to talk about this?\n\nMcWhorter: The things Ellis Cose describes in his book The Rage of a Privileged Class are real and they should be documented. My problem is that there is a kind of orthodoxy among most black writers and thinkers that what Ellis Cose talks about is the main thing that we ought to be talking about. If you look at what black people considered important to talk about 75 years ago, they were interested in talking about progress and uplift and what they could achieve despite the obstacles.\n\nToday, there is such a defeatist message based on all those indignities that Cose talks about. So, for example, let's say you're a black man in Manhattan trying to hail a cab uptown at midnight and a cab doesn't stop. Frankly, I believe that if something like that happens to you about once every two months, there are many white people much, much, worse off than you. I've been told this is a frivolous comparison, but I don't think so: I often think about a white person who weighs 300 pounds. For me that's a life in hell. The indignities that that person endures every day -- sitting in a seat, the teasing as they walk down the street. I can honestly say that 100 years ago, even a 300-pound white person was better off than any black person. Today that is not true.\n\nREASON: You talk about a \"cultural disconnect\" from formal learning. How can public policy address this?\n\nMcWhorter: I think one of the things that would help most would be school vouchers. Small schools with concentrated, innovative teaching have been shown to get through to black children. Although the possibility of getting all black kids into schools like that has never been great, we need to get as many black kids as possible into schools like that.\n\nREASON: Most polls show huge support among blacks for vouchers and school choice. Yet you contend that blacks don't particularly value book-learning and education. Is there a paradox here?\n\nMcWhorter: If anything, black people value education more highly than white people because there is a sense that we are a culture climbing upward. The anti-intellectualism among blacks is more subtle. It's what happens once students are in school. Black parents value that you go get a degree, that you go get earning power, and maybe that you go be a historian or whatever. But the cultural dynamic senses learning as something that other people do, so there is kind of a block on engaging it on that more intimate level.\n\nREASON: These traits -- treating education as a means to an end -- probably aren't limited to the black culture. Have you looked at other cultures?\n\nMcWhorter: The Irish were known to be anti-intellectual people before they became \"white.\" That's a universal American quality. Black culture is different in that skepticism about pointy heads extends into the upper class. It all comes back to the fact that on average in 1995, among black students whose parents made $70,000 a year or more and had at least one master's degree or above, SAT scores were lower than the SAT scores of children from white families making no more than $10,000. That's scary. That's a really scary statistic. That's the problem.\n\nREASON: Are you aware of the \"stereotyping anxiety\" research done by psychologist Claude Steele? He finds that if test-taking is preceded by positive messages, then black children do better.\n\nMcWhorter: It's an interesting hypothesis but I'm not sure how important that observation is. One reason is that it has been shown that women suffer from the same stereotype threat and yet girls are ahead in schools. One thing that I have never seen that research address is the extent to which actual tests and schoolwork in the real world present the stereotype threat. It's not so much that black kids are very threatened by school. It's that there is a sense in the black identity that school is an alien realm. It's not so much that it's seen as threatening, but that it's seen as something apart from what you regard as your essence.\n\nThere is a sense that to embrace school in a real way would be a step outside of your identity. Or better, your identity is one that does not condition you to embrace knowledge that doesn't have to do wholeheartedly with black people. You have to remember that stereotype-threat analysis is so appealing in the education community because it's a victim-based approach.\n\nThat doesn't automatically render it untrue, but it's interesting to think about what Claude Steele proposes as the solution, to the extent that he really indulges in talking about solutions: He advocated the setting of high standards. His idea is to let black children know that you expect the best of them. Doesn't that mean that affirmative action is not really a very good idea?\n\nREASON: Not just affirmative action but race-conscious policies in general, because it appears that when you remind people of racial issues, it brings out the stereotype anxiety.\n\nMcWhorter: You're black. You're different. You're a victim. We think you can't do it, so we're making things different for you.\n\nREASON: You support racial preferences in business but oppose it in education. Why?\n\nMcWhorter: Affirmative action is good when it redresses racism. That's why affirmative action was good in 1965. Affirmative action in business can counteract the tendency for sometimes-subtle cultural conflicts, or the \"birds of a feather\" phenomenon that can deny people promotions or even jobs in the first place. I think there is still room for discrimination to operate in places such as Coca-Cola, with it not having to be anybody's intention. So the idea of racial preferences is not anathema to me. But I do consider it to be chemotherapy: It's something that creates as much harm as good and you withdraw it the minute that you've gotten rid of the main symptoms. In education, that happened 15 years ago. In the world of business, I don't think that we're there yet.\n\nREASON: The justification for affirmative action has shifted from a remedial project to a diversity project, ensuring that racial and ethnic groups are represented at certain elite institutions. Doesn't this mean it's more important in higher education?\n\nMcWhorter: Diversity is nice, but it cannot be weighted above competence. The diversity rationale was created as a kind of fig leaf. Basically, I think we can sacrifice diversity, which is a rather weak concept anyway, because we have a very selective sense of what kind of diversity we want.\n\nREASON: Doesn't it worry you that if elite schools stop picking by race, there would be a large decline in the number of black students attending those institutions?\n\nMcWhorter: If all schools quit using race as an admissions criterion, there would be a bleak 10 years where there would not be as many black kids on elite campuses as we might like. There would still be a good number, though. It's not as if black students are so utterly, uniformly awful that Harvard could not find any black students for its freshman class. Yes, the numbers will fall. But during that 10 years, word would get out in the black community and in the education community that black kids have to do as well as everybody else. Black people have shown that they can rise to any obstacle. We're not allowed to rise to any obstacle when it comes to academics. We're always given these lowered bars.\n\nREASON: What about the argument that if you repeal racial preferences there will be an even greater dilution of standards as college administrators push to eliminate SAT scores and admit everyone from the top 10 percent of high schools?\n\nMcWhorter: It's very troubling, and it's going to happen. Admitting every student in the top 4 percent or top 10 percent or whatever is not an ideal policy. But at least you would have a situation where every black kid on campus can say they are on campus because they were the best among the people with whom they went to school. The SAT is a valid, if partial, measure of a person's preparation for a school.\n\nIf Berkeley and the University of California abolish the SAT, I would resign. It's so clear that the only reason UC President Richard Atkinson even proposed the idea is because he can't bear to see minority students actually challenged to do as well as everyone else.\n\nREASON: You have taken advantage of affirmative action in your career, from fellowships to job offers. Why criticize it now?\n\nMcWhorter: There was a juncture in my life where I did use affirmative action to get a postdoctoral fellowship that got my foot in the door at Berkeley. It was a decision I made at a time when I was much less politicized than I am now. You evolve as time goes by. It was also a time when my back was up against a wall because of a very narrow job market. I look back on it and I realize that it diminishes my sense of accomplishment. I defend my right to question the policy after having gone through it. The \"pulling in the ladder\" argument is actually a rather nihilistic one, because any black person who got anywhere in life has been affected by affirmative action.\n\nREASON: What changes have you noticed at Berkeley since racial preferences were abolished throughout the UC system in 1996?\n\nMcWhorter: The black kids are just as qualified -- or sometimes, unqualified -- as the white and Asian students. They are exactly the same. There is no longer a two-caste system at Berkeley, where the black and Latino students are obviously of lower preparation and lower caliber than the white and the Asian students.\n\nREASON: You write a lot about how some African Americans are \"culturally black,\" and others are not. What does it mean to be culturally black?\n\nMcWhorter: One, your speech reflects the conglomeration of traits linguists call black English. At the very least, you could be identified as black over the phone. Two, devout Christianity is central to black culture. Three, you sense residual racism as an obstacle to advancement. Today, that is a keystone to having what is a proper \"black\" identity.\n\nREASON: You report problems with culturally black students regardless of their class and family background. What is your experience with black students who are culturally white?\n\nMcWhorter: Black students who are culturally white generally do not have the kind of disconnect from learning that I see in other blacks. Black students who are culturally black yet who are sailing through school are almost invariably people with Caribbean or African parents.\n\nREASON: You've largely been rejected by black academics and intellectuals. The novelist Ishmael Reed, who also teaches at Berkeley, has even called you a \"rent-a-black.\" You've been embraced by the conservative establishment. What's your reaction to that?\n\nMcWhorter: In terms of a great many other things, I am a very leftist person. I have a natural sense of ambivalence when I'm embraced by card-carrying white conservatives. I have to keep telling myself that I do believe a lot of what they believe and they are human beings. However, a lot of conservatives don't realize that black people have things to complain about. The idea that black people need to \"just get over it\" is an idea that I can't quite handle. Despite all of the huffing and puffing in Losing the Race , a lot of what I was trying to do is make clear that this is where black people are coming from. That's why I have a long section about racism and the black experience.\n\nREASON: Do you ever find that you are invited to be the only black voice on a panel? To be a token, essentially?\n\nMcWhorter: There are often other black people present. The event I attended today for Empower America is actually the only thing I've done where I was the only black. This event was definitely Token Black City. I don't have any ambivalence about it. If conservatives need to show their message is not anti-black, and I believe very often it isn't, and if one way they want to show that is by having a black person be in their company, I don't consider that to be discrimination. \"Token black\" is a term that we've heard so long that we don't always think about the meaning anymore. It's not that they don't want me there. It's not that they don't agree with what I'm saying. It's that they want to show that they are not anti-black. And if they are not, then I consider myself to be doing a service by appearing.\n\nREASON: You voted for Ralph Nader.\n\nMcWhorter: I did.\n\nREASON: Yet you recommend in a piece for the conservative City Journal that blacks, who vote Democrat in overwhelming numbers, ought to give Republicans a second look. What could the Republican Party possibly do to attract black voters?\n\nMcWhorter: One thing and one thing only: Address racial profiling. The situation of young black men in the criminal justice system today is the main obstacle to a general revolution in black America toward the truly progressive ideologies of the past.\n\nThirty years ago, if you asked black people what the evidence was that racism pervaded the United States, they would have said, \"Well, there are no black thises and no black thats .\" That's what I heard when I was young. Today, what you hear is, \"One out of three young black men are in prison or involved in the criminal justice system.\" That is a mantra in the black community memorized from the age of 12.\n\nNow, the fact is that in many communities, if you didn't concentrate crime-fighting efforts on young black men, you'd have a community preyed upon by criminals. A little-told story is that in many such communities, the actual residents are clamoring for more police enforcement, not less. And it's true that the statistics on profiling tend to be presented in misleading ways in the liberal media.\n\nBut those are things for the educated and the pundits to quibble over. Out on the street, there is a sense that the police are set against young black men. It's clear that black men get killed too often by the police. All we need is one generation of black children to grow up in an America where it could not be said that the police are set against young black men.\n\nREASON: So much of racial profiling results from the War on Drugs. Don't we have to get at that as a root cause of prejudicial policing?\n\nMcWhorter: I'm afraid to say it in print: I don't think there should be any War on Drugs. It's an utter and complete absurdity, a puritanical holdover. It is one of the shames of the United States in the early 21st century. The real magic bullet would just be to make drugs legal. A lot of crime would go away immediately, that day. But it's also clear that we are not going to legalize drugs. With that reality, we must be pragmatic.\n\nREASON: Libertarians such as Walter Williams and conservatives such as Thomas Sowell argue that it was a mistake for black Americans to place their faith in government as a primary avenue for advancement. They say that it's the market and private sector that offers black people more promise for advancement. Do you have any thoughts on that?\n\nMcWhorter: That was not true in 1965. Thomas Sowell is a hero of mine, but it still shocks me to realize he was saying things I'm saying today as early as 1970. That was too soon, I think. But today, they are both dead right. Walter says those things particularly well. The market is cruel, but it can also be extremely beneficial and extremely fair. I think for the vast majority of black Americans today, the solution is neither government in terms of government fixing things for us, nor is it leaders.\n\nREASON: You've written about racial issues and popular culture. Do you think there are serious issues of how blacks are portrayed on television?\n\nMcWhorter: None whatsoever at this point. Black people are portrayed on TV in all of their aspects. If you only look at the networks, today that's like analyzing emissions from cars but only looking at General Motors cars. The networks are just a few stations of about 25 you have to look at. That battle has been won. In the movies, there are so many black films that nobody can keep up with them all. I used to see every black film that came out, bad or good, because I thought it was my responsibility. I could not do that now without being an obsessive.\n\nREASON: What are your views on reparations for slavery?\n\nMcWhorter: In a nutshell, we already have them. Yes, there should be reparations. They are called welfare, workfare, affirmative action, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, every community development corporation that's remaking the ghettoes in our cities, scholarships specifically for black people.\n\nIn another universe, all of these could be called reparations. What slavery reparations activist Randall Robinson and the gang want is more stuff -- although you notice that they tend not to be able to specify what the stuff is going to be besides identifying companies that profited from slavery. They want more stuff specifically labeled as reparations so that white America will acknowledge what happened with slavery. I think white America already did acknowledge that.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

Classic episode where he got in trouble for telling an Irish joke, and his Irish co-worker, a black guy, but really he's Irish, complained.\n\nAndy ends up learning that we are to all celebrate and ignore all the things that make us different and the same....\n\n\"I'm not sure if I shouldn't be allowed to think that, or am required to think that.\"\n\nThis happens to people in MA all the time.\n\nI have nothing intelligent to add.\n\nYou're in good company. Neither did the 6th Circuit.\n\nI think I just died a lot inside at how colossally, unbelievably, skull-fuckingly retarded the ruling on the amendment is.\n\nIs this for real, or an Onion article? Seriously?\n\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld a race-conscious admissions policy at the University of Texas at Austin\n\nGreat, let Rachel Maddow know that Rand Paul's White Toast Diner is back in business!\n\nAwesome. So after getting positively thumped in the law school a decade and a half ago, UT's main campus ignores the state policy and goes back to the policy that got tossed out. Its like these little admin drones can't fucking help themselves.\n\nforbid... from granting \"preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin.\"\n\nthe 6th Circuit ruled 2 to 1 that the amendment violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because it restructures the state's political structure to the detriment of minorities.\n\nSo NOT restructuring the state's political structure to the detriment of minorities can only be achieved by granting preferential treatment to minorities. In other words, minorities are incapable of advancing politically or academically WITHOUT preferential treatment. There is a word for those who believe that race is inherent factor in determining the abilities of a person, what is that word again?\n\nI know the word is not racist.\n\nBecause it is the racists who would repeal laws that mandate people be treated differently based upon race.\n\nThe word you are looking for must be egalitarian.\n\nFor it is the egalitarians who insist that different standards be applied to people based upon their race.\n\nSTOP!!!! YOU'RE TEARING APART THE FABRIC OF SPACE TIME.\n\nRelax, the destruction will be merely limited to our own galaxy.\n\n*whew*\n\ncarry on then.\n\nwait...\n\nGotta love white conservatives claiming they get to decide when racial inequity has been solved.\n\n\"We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today,\" Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the majority in Grutter v. Bollinger .\n\nWhite conservatives?\n\n\"White conservatives?\"\n\nHe means \"Politicians\". It's a common slip when you're an unabashed partisan.\n\nHell is downwards -- pack your shit and get going, asshole.\n\nwhite conservatives\n\nWhat effect does their skin color or political persuasion have on their ability to judge the state of equality under law? Would an overweight, moderate, Asian woman have more astute insight because of her weight, politics, ethnicity?\n\nwhen racial inequity has been solved\n\nI suppose it would be solved whenever the state fails to discriminate based on race.\n\nWould an overweight, moderate, Asian woman have more astute insight\n\nWise. Latinas.\n\nThe text of the 14th Amendment makes the question of the \"solving\" of \"unequity\" irrelevant to the question at hand.\n\nHey, maybe there's a lot of inequity out there. Too bad that states can't discriminate on the basis of race in the provision of services while trying to fix that. Oh well.\n\nNo one claimed to be able to decide when race inequity has been solved.\n\n\"Gotta love white conservatives claiming they get to decide when racial inequity has been solved.\" Gotta love shithead's inability to read.\n\nBetter to let the beneficiaries of AA decide when \"equity\" has been achieved, right? That should be any century now, I suppose.\n\nIn respect of civil rights common to all citizens, the Constitution of the United States does not, I think, permit any public authority to know the race of those entitled to be protected in the enjoyment of such rights. Every true man has pride of race, and, under appropriate circumstances, when the rights of others, his equals before the law, are not to be affected, it is his privilege to express such pride and to take such action based upon it as to him seems proper. But I deny that any legislative body or judicial tribunal may have regard to the race of citizens when the civil rights of those citizens are involved. Indeed, such legislation as that here in question is inconsistent not only with that equality of rights which pertains to citizenship, National and State, but with the personal liberty enjoyed by everyone within the United States.\n\nPlessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 554-55 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting).\n\nHmm. Black is white after all. Or up is down, take your pick.\n\nI suppose you Constitutional purists think just 3/5ths of Michigan's entire minority population should be guaranteed admittance to higher education.\n\nWhy should a person's heritage even be known when applying for college? If you've got the grades and your check clears, you're in.\n\nEh. This may work in Montana. Flagship state university campuses (Ann Arbor and Austin being two of the very largest undergrad campuses in the US) have maybe 7000-10000 Fall semester freshman slots. UT had 31000 freshmen applicants in 2009. They have a top-10% automatic acceptance limit as of Fall 2011 that limits the auto-enrollment by people in the top 10% of their class to 75% of the freshman slots. In 2009, there were something like 7500 freshmen. That means that there are 1800 slots for people who aren't in the top 10% of their class at that campus.\n\nUm...take the next 2%?\n\nNext 1% plus the best 1% at football.\n\nUT and A&M both, IIRC, wanted some wiggle room from the top 10% rule so they could bring in a more diverse freshman class instead of just the top 10%.\n\nLets say there are 7500 slots for freshman. Want more than just top 10%? Take top 20,000 applicants.\n\nPut in hat. Draw 7500 out at random. Accept them.\n\nYou should get the racial characteristics of the top 25% or whatever, instead of top 10%.\n\nNot good enough? Put all 31000 applicants in a hat, draw 7500 out. Of course, your standards just dropped dramatically, so less (or more) are going to apply in future.\n\nActually, they usually accept about 14000 students. I mean, the top 10% of my brother's class would have been 110 students from one Houston area high school. I'm not arguing for or against the top 10% rule. Only pointing out that their guess is that they will only get to the top 8% before slots fill.\n\nI would think the 10% rule was implemented to have that effect already. As the kids from the \"good\" schools get rejected in favor of inner city kids as the top of classes that weren't taught anything and bomb the standardized tests.\n\n0/5ths of the entire Earth's population should be guaranteed admittance to higher education.\n\nWE ARE COMPETING WITH THE CHINESE. Do you want a diploma gap?\n\nwe need to teach our kids to cheat harder. Oh wait.\n\nThe Sixth Circuit is getting to be as bad, if not worse, than the Ninth. IIRC, the Sixth has received the most summary reversals. When the SCOTUS summarily reverses you, you have a problem.\n\nThe Michigan decision is even worse than it appears on its face. The ruling essentially argued that it violated the 14th amendment because it would be too hard for minorities to get a ballot initiative passed to repeal the new policy.\n\nThat's amazing. Do they really think we're that stupid? This stuff doesn't even pass the giggle test of absurdity. Are they even trying anymore? I guess they know it comes down to getting leftist judges who agree, and a biased media to lie about it. Common sense is gone.\n\nUntil race is no longer considered in our laws, we will be violating the equal protection clause.\n\nShorter 6th Circuit:\n\nSTOP RESISTING!\n\nBravo!\n\nThe side benefit is that I will be actively trying to miscegenate *just so my kids can check the \"white\" box on those ethnicity forms*. Not that I wasn't trying anyway.\n\nor black (although with a lower likelihood, based on empirical dating history)\n\nMy wife is Chinese, and we frequently debate how to instruct our children on filling out those forms.\n\nhapa pake.\n\nyou should do an experiment. Apply to ten colleges. Put Asian on five, and white on the other five.

      "text": "N.Y. Times' Nick Kristof Can't Run for Oregon Governor\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nEugene Volokh | 2.17.2022 4:01 PM\n\nFrom today's decision in State ex rel. Kristof v. Fagan :\n\nRelator [Kristof] is a prospective candidate for governor. After he filed his declaration of candidacy with the Secretary of State, the secretary asked relator for additional information to substantiate that he will \"have been three years next preceding his election, a resident within this State,\" as required to serve as governor by Article V, section 2, of the Oregon Constitution.\n\nRelator submitted additional materials in support of his claim that he meets the constitutional eligibility requirement. Upon reviewing those materials, the secretary determined that, although relator had previously been a resident of Oregon, he had been a resident of New York since at least 2000 and he had not reestablished Oregon residency by November 2019. The secretary therefore concluded that relator did not meet the constitutional requirement....\n\nIn communicating its decision to relator, the Elections Division correctly emphasized that \"it is not the Elections Division's role to determine whether any candidate is sufficiently 'Oregonian'\" or \"to examine the depth or sincerity of a candidate's emotional connection to Oregon.\" That is not this court's role either. It is undisputed that relator has deep roots in Oregon and has consistently spent time here over many years.\n\nThis case, however, requires us to decide two legal questions: (1) the meaning of \"resident within this State,\" as those words are used in Article V, section 2, of the Oregon Constitution; and (2) whether the secretary was required to conclude that relator met that legal standard.\n\nAs we explain below, we conclude that \"resident within,\" when viewed against the legal context that surrounded the Oregon Constitution's 1857 ratification, is best understood to refer to the legal concept of \"domicile,\" which requires \"the fact of a fixed habitation or abode in a particular place, and an intention to remain there permanently or indefinitely[.]\" Reed's Will (Or. 1906). Under that legal concept, a person can have only a single residence at a time.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, we further hold that, on the record before the secretary, she was not required to conclude that relator was domiciled in Oregon between November 2019 and December 2020. Finally, although relator challenges the constitutionality of the durational residency requirement in Article V, section 2, we conclude that that question is not properly considered through this mandamus proceeding. We therefore ... deny relator's petition....\n\nWe recognize that relator has longstanding ties to Oregon, that he owns substantial property and operates a farm here, and that the secretary did not question his current  Oregon residency. Moreover, he has thought deeply and written extensively about the challenges faced by those living in rural areas of Oregon-and the rest of the country.\n\nBut that is not the issue here. The issue, instead, is whether relator has been, during the three years preceding the November 2022 election, \"a resident within this State.\" For the reasons set out above, we conclude that the secretary was not compelled to conclude, on the record before her, that relator satisfied that requirement.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "My White People Problem-And Ours\n\nPlus, a riff on Donald Trump's 'disinfectant' word salad.\n\nDear Reader (even those who would, ironically, pretend to know the definition of \" ultracrepidarian \"),\n\nOne of the great things about white people-well, not the people themselves, but their place in society-is that it's totally fine to crap on them from a great height in ways that would be incontrovertibly bigoted about virtually any other group (save perhaps Christians- white Christians). You can rant about white privilege, white uncoolness, white customs and culture (real and alleged), white bigotry (real and alleged), white bread, white dancing skills, white food, white music, white sexual inadequacies, white whatever, and, at least among certain cultural elites, be celebrated for it. When non-whites do it, it's courageous, speaking truth to power or just funny. When whites do it, it's a manifestation of self-awareness, atonement, or solidarity with the oppressed (and, less often, just funny).\n\nI have no scientific data to support this, but I am pretty confident that one of the few veins of humor a stand-up comic can still get away with on an (overwhelmingly white) progressive college campus is white-bashing.\n\nNow, I should say, not all of the criticisms are without merit, and many of the jokes are actually pretty funny. This isn't some alt-right bleating about white victimology, it's just an observation. Of course, opponents of whiteness will tell you the freedom to not think in such terms is a form of \"white privilege,\" and, to be honest, I think they've got something of a point. Part of being a minority-black, Hispanic, gay, Jew-is having your outsider status remain a bigger part of your self-understanding. When you define \"normal\" or \"mainstream,\" you can take certain norms for granted, and that really is a form of privilege. A parallel argument is equally true about women. When a lot of the rules of the game are \"male,\" women will be more aware of their outsider-ness than men. Don't worry, I'm not going all intersectional on you. I'm just willing to concede that people who make these arguments have a point, even if I don't think it's as important or all-explanatory as they do.\n\nBut the good news is that I'm not writing about how ethnic or racial minorities view white people; I'm writing about how certain white people think about white people. A recent Pew poll finds that white Democrats are much more concerned that their presidential nominee is an old white male than black and Hispanic Democrats are. Almost half of white Democrats don't like it, while less than a third of Hispanic and black Democrats are bothered. Derek Thompson posted the cross tabs and they're even more interesting:\n\nAll Dems: 41%\n\nBlack: 28%\n\nHispanic: 30%\n\nWhite: 49%\n\nUnder 30: 54%\n\nPost-grad: 58%\n\nWhite college-educated under 50: 64%\n\nWhite college-educated women under 50: 69%\n\nOne of the big takeaways from that \"Hidden Tribes\" study from a few years ago was the \"rich, white civil war\" ( David Brooks' words ) between upscale white progressives and upscale white conservatives. The blue checkmark arguments on Twitter are the frontlines of that civil war. The conservatives are more conservative than your average Republican, and the progressives are way more liberal than your average Democrat. But the parties aren't symmetrical, because while the overwhelming majority of Republicans are white (83 percent in 2017), the share of non-Hispanic whites in the Democratic Party has been shrinking, fast. \"In 2017, 59% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters were non-Hispanic whites,\" according to Pew , \"down from 75% two decades earlier.\"\n\nAs working-class whites leave the Democratic Party, the remaining whites are way more ideologically progressive, and the affluent ones even more so. That's why when Ralph Northam stumbled into his blackface mess, the blue checkmark crowd was adamant that he had to go, while the average Virginia Democrat wasn't-and black Democrats were less supportive of his ouster than white Democrats.\n\nThis is a huge political transformation. Blacks once dominated the left wing of the Democratic party; they are now forces for moderation, and it looks more and more like the same holds for Hispanics . It would be very premature to say that Hispanics are poised to become Republicans in large numbers any time soon. But it is worth noting that the standard talking point from the most rabid immigration opponents that immigration imports Democratic voters is a bit more complicated than they'd let you believe.\n\nBut that's a subject for another day. What interests me is the assumption held by so many woke white Democrats that their performative anti-whiteness is a virtuous expression of their anti-racism. No, I'm not about to argue that \"Progressives are the real racists.\" I've learned that there's plenty of racism on the right, more than I once appreciated. But that doesn't mean there isn't something racist, or if you prefer, bigoted, in the way white progressives think.\n\nFirst and foremost, they're bigoted against whites, particularly downscale whites who won't practice the same performative rituals. It's bigotry derived from guilt and self-hatred, not animosity. But that doesn't make it any less real.\n\nIt's also directed outward. The white journalists, academics, and politicians who opine about \"white privilege\"-and occasionally behave like disfavored Chinese Communists forced to wear dunce caps as they denounce themselves for ideological deviationism-talk about minorities as if they know their interests and concerns better than they do. A poll last year found that 98 percent of Hispanics rejected the label \"Latinx.\" Meanwhile, I am sure that the numbers are close to reversed in Elizabeth Warren's office or among the ranks of Beto O'Rourke's biggest supporters. Think about it this way: When white liberals led the cause to switch from words like \"negro\" or \"colored\" to \"African-American\" or \"black,\" they were doing so in response to demands from normal black people. There is no comparable bottom-up demand from Hispanics to be called \"Latinx.\" It's a wholly top-down phenomenon, and if I were Hispanic I'd find it remarkably condescending.\n\nWhen I talk to college students, I often try to explain that not all political correctness is bad. Some of it is just an effort to treat people with respect in an increasingly diverse society. Think of it as good manners. You should call people what they want to be called. Good manners don't become any less valuable or legitimate just because they can be described as political correctness. The bad kind of political correctness is the attempt to manipulate language and norms so as to dominate and humiliate people who don't know the latest codes and shibboleths. It's a form of gnosis where a guild polices the ideologically and professionally disloyal. This is not primarily a racial thing-language is one of the most powerful social enforcement mechanisms in any society.\n\nAs I discussed on a recent episode of The Remnant , the Asian students being discriminated against at places like Harvard aren't victims of anti-Asian bias (even if the disparate impact of their discrimination is objectively anti-Asian). The stellar students being turned away tend to come from immigrant homes. Kids from that background, like Jews and other ethnic groups in the past, want \"real\" jobs in STEM or business. They are less steeped in social justice grievance peddling. Their parents or grandparents came here because they think America is, on balance, a great place to be and affords opportunities for immigrants they couldn't find at home. These schools are horrified by the idea of a student body unversed in, or unpersuaded by, the woke narrative of American perfidy.\n\nThink of it this way: I'm sure there is a faculty lounge where people would gasp if you said \"Hispanic\" instead of \"Latinx.\" But there probably isn't a Cuban, Mexican, or Puerto Rican diner or barber shop anywhere in the country where that would happen. But there are probably thousands where people would have no idea what you were saying if you said \"Latinx\"-or even more likely, they'd think you were some kind of officious dweeb for using it.\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that some of this is no doubt the result of elite white progressives being misled by elite non-white progressives. Just as political correctness is used by whites to dominate and exert influence over less progressive whites, many elite woke professionals do the same thing to their white counterparts. No one is more susceptible to being bullied into wokeness than an already-woke white progressive.\n\nI actually find this to be a cause for hope. While predictions of America's white majority disappearing are premature and exaggerated-on the left and the right-the real story of America in the coming decades may in fact be one where woke white condescension becomes a thing of the past.\n\nPaging Dr. Trump\n\nSo I partially violated the Golden Rule of this \"news\"letter. I allowed my critics to influence how I wrote this thing today. When I sat down to write this, all I wanted to do was riff on the glorious Veep homage yesterday at the White House. But I let some of you get in my head. I feared I would get a \"there he goes again\" dismissal. But if you got this far, it's too late.\n\nPresident Trump had a habit of ticking off all the \"all-time highs\" of the stock market on his watch, and there have been a lot. Yesterday may have been an all-time-high in Trumpism, and there have been many of them.\n\nBy now, you know he floated the idea of using light inside the bodies of COVID-19 patients to kill the virus. He also suggested that doctors explore the possibility of using the virus-destroying power of disinfectants internally, perhaps by injecting it to kill the disease.\n\nBefore I continue, I should clarify: \"Peak Trumpism\" isn't simply about what the president says and does, but how the people around him and supporting him react. Dr. Birx's kill-me-now expression as the president mused is part of it. And so was the near instantaneous \"fact check\" (since \"reframed\" as an opinion piece) from Breitbart editor Joel Pollack:\n\n\"Trump used the word 'inject,' but what he meant was using a process - which he left 'medical doctors' to define - in which patients' lungs might be cleared of the virus, given new knowledge about its response to light and other factors.\"\n\nThis is one of the greatest examples of Adam White's observation that we aren't supposed to take the president literally or seriously but hypothetically. There was literally nothing in what Trump said that supports Pollack's interpretation. But, by the magic power of turd-polishing hypothesizing, a face-saving explanation is conjured from thin air.\n\nBut it gets better. While everyone in Christendom was dunking on Pollack's clean-up effort, Trump \"clarified\" his remarks today. He now says that he was being \"sarcastic\" when he suggested that maybe people could inject disinfectant or get some kind of UV flashlight enema to kill COVID-19. In other words, Trump is admitting that he said precisely what Pollack says he didn't say, he just didn't mean it seriously, which as anyone who watched it knows is ridiculous. But this is what Trump does to his most ardent defenders all the time. He lets them march the plank and then saws it off (just ask Brian Kemp).\n\nBut it gets better. He then went on to say that he still wants his scientists to investigate whether sunlight and disinfectants can be used internally (relevant word salad here ). So what, exactly, was he being sarcastic about?\n\nBut it gets better, or more accurately, worse. Trump's explanation for suggesting we go one shade shy of full Tide Pod is that he was being sarcastic. It's not true. But how is this a defense? We crossed the grim threshold of 50,000 American deaths, and we are already in an economic depression, and he thinks that this is the time for playful sarcasm about injecting Lysol (or some generic-brand disinfectant)? Why would you think this is a defense? And why on earth would you want to defend that?\n\nHere's what I think is going on: First, Trump has a bad screenwriter's or destructive toddler's idea of how science works. He thinks he understands technical matters because his uncle was a physicist and he has a good brain. Small children playing doctor think swallowing disinfectant cures things. Bad screenwriters love stuff like shiny lights fixing things.\n\nSecond, Trump isn't just frustrated with this pandemic, he's bored by it. He won't do even minimal homework . Put aside his weird theories-Trump seemed genuinely surprised that sunlight and disinfectant kills the virus, something we always knew.\n\nThird, his impatience causes him to yearn for an easy fix, and his narcissism compels him to be the one who discovers it. That was a big part of his hydroxychloroquine fixation. He wanted to be the one who could claim credit for delivering us from all of this with an easy fix. The same compulsion drives him to impulsively suggest a ridiculous solution off-the-cuff without thinking it through.\n\nAnd here's the last part of my theory. You'd think he would have asked about these magic remedies when he was briefed on this stuff before he approached the podium. My suspicion is that he did. But because it's such an amazingly stupid idea, Birx or someone else didn't want to anger him with bluntness. So they probably told him something like, \"That's never been tried,\" or, \"I've never heard of anyone doing that.\" Their understandable need to be diplomatic left him with the impression that he stumbled onto a brilliant idea that never occurred to the fancy-pants experts around him. So he freelanced his miracle cure nonsense in front of the whole country.\n\nIt's axiomatic that you go to war with a pandemic using the commander-in-chief you have, not the one you want. What I cannot fathom at this point is why anyone still thinks this is the president you would want to fight a pandemic.\n\nVarious & Sundry\n\nCanine Update: The girls are doing okay, though we think both of them are just starting to show their age a bit. Pippa still loves her tennis ball, but more often she carries it like a security bl... well a security ball . Pippa is also just a bit more creaky, and having the experience we had with Cosmo (of blessed memory), we're inclined to lean into that a bit. At the end Cosmo was two surgeries shy of being fully bionic. Zoë is maturing as well. I mean, don't get me wrong, she chased some deer yesterday, and she'll never pass up an opportunity to chase a bunny or get in a knife fight in Reno (the bunnies are just so damn hoppy, and that guy in Reno needed killing). But she now understands that running full tilt at a squirrel at a great distance is a waste of energy. It's a bit sad. The catch in the deal with dogs is that they give you unconditional love, companionship and pure doggy entertainment , but not for nearly long enough. I'm not getting morose. They've got, by my admittedly sentimental math, several more decades with us. But it's just becoming clear that the escaped-monkey-from-a-cocaine-study energy is starting to ebb and they are regressing to the mean of normal high-energy-dog energy . The exciting news is that this weekend we are leaving to quarantine in a new undisclosed location where both of them can be rejuvenated by chasing new critters and swimming in restorative waters.

      "text": "Subscribe to our newsletters and always be informed.\n\nBy signing up to our newsletters you agree to the Just the News Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nWalensky admits teachers union chief had her personal and official cellphones, cites CDC school-mask study contradicted by more robust research.\n\nPublished: June 16, 2023 5:47am\n\nUpdated: June 16, 2023 5:59am\n\nIt took 10 weeks of negotiations with the Department of Health and Human Services to get CDC Director Rochelle Walensky to testify this week before a GOP-led House oversight committee on the pandemic - almost too late before her late-June exit, says the panel's chairman.\n\n\"Maybe you were willing the whole time,\" Chairman GOP Rep. Brad Wenstrup said, amid what what he called the \"seemingly illogical excuses\" the department gave for withholding Walensky.\n\nThe long wait to review her 29-month record on COVID policy - ended by a threatened subpoena - produced mixed results at the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic hearing Tuesday.\n\nWalensky repeatedly declined to answer questions related to the agency's alleged efforts to censor purported COVID misinformation , citing litigation.\n\nShe instead told full House Oversight committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) that her top priority was to \"get facts out to people ... in plain language\" and convince Americans \"how well [vaccines] worked.\"\n\nSubcommittee member Rep. Rich McCormick, a Georgia Republican, served as a physician on the COVID frontlines through December yet was censored and had his license threatened for statements ultimately proven correct.\n\nHe told Walensky: \"Black liberals and white conservatives are both mistrusting\" of Center of Disease Control and Preventions claims.\n\nRepublicans on the panel got Walensky to admit American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten, who demanded strict conditions for school reopening including a \"closure trigger,\" had Walensky's personal and official cellphone numbers and that they \"may\" have texted on both.\n\nIn her own hearing, Weingarten acknowledged a direct line to Walensky.\n\nWallensky said she didn't delete any texts due to federal retention rules and admitted more may come out amid \"hundreds\" of Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\nGOP lawmakers say they have five texts.\n\nWhile the CDC sought \"feedback from 50 other\" groups before releasing its reopening guidance, which didn't adopt AFT's proposed trigger, Walensky rejected Wenstrup's invitations to dismiss the trigger as unscientific or at least \"unwarranted.\"\n\nWenstrup also said the CDC has yet to turn over a \"single document\" on the drafting of reopening guidance in response to a subcommittee request 11 weeks ago and asked Walensky to \"fully commit\" to complying.\n\nShe promised to \"act in good faith and get you the documents we can\" and make agency employees available for transcribed interviews.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Raul Ruiz, the panel's top Democrat, praised Walensky for guiding the U.S. \"out of the darkest days\" of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading the \"most successful vaccination campaign\" in U.S. history and reopening the vast majority of schools \"forced to close\" by President Trump in just a year.\n\nCongress can thank the CDC by giving it \"expanded workforce authorities\" such as direct hire authority, overtime and \"danger pay\" to reduce the shortage of public health workers, Walensky told Ruiz.\n\nSome Republicans expressed sympathy for the political challenges Walensky faced, particularly when the White House dismissed her comments on the safety of reopening schools in February 2021 as \"personal,\" though she spoke at a White House press conference.\n\nWalensky on Tuesday stood by her view, citing the \"other five layers\" of mitigation available to schools before vaccines were widely available to teachers.\n\nThe agency acted quickly to update guidance when warranted, she said, such as reducing in-school physical distance to three feet from the six feet inexplicably assumed necessary in the U.S., an international outlier.\n\n\"I think you tried to be honest,\" said House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), also an Oversight member.\n\nHowever, he suggested, Walensky started making \"misleading statements\" after the Biden administration \"hung you out to dry.\"\n\nGOP lawmakers seized on her spring 2021 claims that COVID vaccines fully stop transmission and infection, which the CDC quickly walked back at the time.\n\nWalensky claimed Tuesday that was \"generally true\" for the Wuhan and Alpha variants of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nHowever, University of California San Francisco epidemiologist Tracy Beth Hoeg - who testified in a different committee on CDC pandemic policy last week - noted transmission wasn't even tested in the trials.\n\nWalensky also declined Wenstrup's invitation to contradict President Biden's claim in summer 2021, as the Delta variant blew through vaccinated Americans, that vaccinated people cannot be hospitalized or die from COVID.\n\n\"We still to this day do not have data\" on how many hospitalized Americans have been vaccinated, Walensky said - part of her pitch to Congress to fund \"data highways\" that would give the CDC standardized, real-time data from all jurisdictions.\n\nMcCormick questioned how well that money would be spent, given the \"tens of billions\" spent on electronic health record systems the CDC says it cannot read.\n\nHe appeared floored when Walensky didn't reject out of hand the \"must-admit orders\" used in states such as New York that sent COVID-positive patients back to nursing homes.\n\nIn a rare move for a Biden administration official, Walensky acknowledged the U.S. took a much more heavy-handed approach to COVID than some European countries with no worse results, without admitting it was overkill.\n\nThe CDC's updated guidance \"effectively condoned\" continued school closures \"despite clear data\" from reopened schools in Europe - and even Iowa - that showed children were poor spreaders and teachers were at no greater risk than other adults, said Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, an Iowa Republican and the state's former public health director.\n\nAsked whether she had consulted pediatric journal research or data from Sweden or Iceland, Walensky said there were \"not a lot of published data from Sweden\" at the time but that research showed in-person Swedish schools had twice the teacher infection rate as remote schools. She also claimed \"overwhelmed hospitals\" convinced Sweden to close schools for older students.\n\nRep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.) scoffed at Republicans' affinity for COVID policies in Europe, which he said was not \"apples to apples\" with the U.S.\n\nA page on the CDC website is still telling Americans to wear masks of any quality to slow COVID spread so \"why aren't you and your staff wearing masks?\" Rep. Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.) asked Walensky.\n\nShe responded that mask guidance depends on community hospitalization rates, but Lesko interjected that Walensky's supposed \"context\" was missing from the mask page she consulted.\n\nWalensky invoked an in-house study from fall 2021 that found American counties without school mask mandates had about 18 more COVID cases per 100,000 than masked districts. Critics quickly noted the difference became negligible when Hoeg, the epidemiologist, extended the observation period and tripled the number of counties in the sample.\n\nThe director previously dismissed the significance of the multi-year Cochrane meta-review that found \"little to no difference\" from masking, because it relied on randomized controlled trials rather than the observational studies the CDC favors.\n\nHHS did not answer Just the News queries about its concerns with Walensky testifying. Neither the CDC nor HHS answered why Walensky cited the in-house mask study when Hoeg's more robust research contradicted it."

      "text": "In a nation founded on whiteness, how to really discuss it?\n\nJohn Bost seems precisely the kind of person that his fellow Americans could have a conversation with - politically moderate, neither an Obama voter nor a Trump one, willing to engage with those both more liberal and more conservative than he is, the former mayor of the North Carolina town where he has lived for more than a quarter century.\n\nTrouble is, when it comes to talking about race with other white people, when it comes to THAT conversation, the talks he tries to have often lead to the exact same place: absolutely nowhere.\n\n\"They try to compliment you. But I read between the lines. They say, 'You're a deep thinker,'\" Bost, 72, of Clemmons, North Carolina, says, laughing. \"After a while, they just don't show up as much.\"\n\nThe conversation. The one about race. The one about whiteness and what it means in a multiracial society that is 150 years out of slavery but still reverberating with racial horror. The 21st-century conversation that seems more relevant than ever, yet the one many white people simply don't have, or don't want to.\n\nAs pervasive and perpetual a subject as race is and has been in the United States - a reality that revealed itself even more starkly over the past year - the conversation about it has been a lopsided one. Most of the talking, protesting and calling for change has come from people of color.\n\n\"We have all these other ways to not talk about race and white supremacy and white nationalism,\" says the Rev. Jason Chesnut, a minister in Vancouver, Washington, who is white.\n\nCall it the \"fish don't know they're in water\" perspective: As the largest, dominant group in the United States, assuming the position of the \"norm,\" white people generally have not identified with having an everyday collective racial identity like Black, Asian American, Native and Latino communities.\n\nAnd yet, those who research it say, whiteness - and a commitment to it, however conscious - is as present as the air.\n\n\"For a long time, it was very easy for white people to sort of ignore race because they could take their racial group for granted and especially in an environment where they didn't perceive a lot of threats to their group and its status,\" said Ashley Jardina, an assistant professor of political science at Duke University who researches white identity politics.\n\nS. Michael Gaddis, an assistant professor of sociology at UCLA, says research shows that for many white people, \"their views on race are still in an era where race is something we should not be talking about.\"\n\nThe day of the insurrection at the US Capitol in January proved an apt case study for looking at this issue.\n\nThe racial makeup of the Jan. 6 insurrection was hard to miss - a predominantly white crowd of rioters , including some with connections to white nationalist and extremist groups, violently disrupting the certification of the presidential election and running unhindered through the Capitol, a symbol of American democracy.\n\nThe lax policing, a contrast to the strong law enforcement presence seen last summer during protests over the police killings of Black men and women, was swiftly pointed out as a racial double standard and the presence of current or former military or law enforcement among the rioters sparked concern over extremism in military ranks.\n\nBut the entire crowd wasn't law enforcement, or flag-waving extremist militia. Far from it. They were also regular, everyday white people - small business owners, students, employees - who were ready to overturn an election because they thought their candidate needed to stay in office.\n\nThat's something white Americans must wrestle with, as Chesnut sees it. Trouble is, he's not particularly optimistic, based on his experience doing anti-racist work. Most white people he meets are surprised that a white man would even talk about race as much as he does.\n\n\"I don't know if white people have learned how to be in a multiracial democracy,\" Chesnut says. \"White supremacy is destroying us, too and I don't think we talk enough about that.\"\n\nOr about much having to do with whiteness. In 2019, a Pew Research Center survey found that just 15 percent of white people considered being white either extremely or very important to how they think about themselves. That compares to 74 percent of Black people, 59 percent of Hispanic people and 56 percent of Asian people. The number of white people who considered their race extremely important to their self-image was just 5 percent.\n\nLaurissa Steadman, a conservative and a Trump supporter, says it's easier for white Americans who are liberal to speak about their politics than it is for white conservatives. She says white conservatives like her are often accused of being racist.\n\nSteadman, from California's San Francisco Bay Area, doesn't see race in what happened at the Capitol. She says it was an expression of political frustration and that the supremacist presence was a small fringe that does not represent conservatives.\n\nBut she acknowledges the criticism that white conservatives face by not being willing to have a conversation about race.\n\n\"I believe there will be assumptions made about them and their voices will not be heard and the assumptions will be the narrative,\" she says.\n\nHigh-profile events driven by racists also impede conversation. When white Americans have emphasized their racial identity in ways viewed as threatening - such as during the Capitol insurrection or the 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia - it makes white people in general more reluctant to acknowledge white as their racial identifier, Jardina says.\n\n\"The more we associate people storming the Capitol and waving Confederate flags with white identity and white supremacy, with a capital W and a capital S, the more we'll find that many white Americans are going to back away from this,\" she says.\n\nThat avoidance is precisely the problem, says the Rev. Susan Chorley, a Boston-area pastor.\n\n\"This mess has been from the founding of this country. This mess has been in our soil. It's in our soul,\" Chorley says. \"It's everywhere and we've never really completely decided that we will look at it.\"\n\nIf white people want the future to be different, she says, they have to be willing to look at the past and the present - and talk about it as if the nation depended upon it. Which, many say, it does.\n\n\"I think it's on us,\" Chorley says. \"We as white people need to be gathering up our white people.\"\n\nBut getting white Americans to genuinely wrestle with these issues, Jardina says, will be a struggle.\n\n\"Are white people willing to confront and have a conversation about the extent to which white racial prejudice and white racism and the desire to maintain white power in the United States, is part of our political process?\" she asks. \"I'd say that for the majority of white people, the answer is no, they're not ready to have that conversation.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Self-proclaimed 'MAGA leftist' shares why Trump's support goes beyond conservatives\n\nPresident Donald Trump's historic comeback in the 2024 election has left many political pundits dumbfounded, but one writer believes Trump's support among one sizable but little-discussed group carried him over the finish line.\n\nAnd she was one of those voters.\n\nBatya Ungar-Sargon, a columnist for The Free Press and author of \"Second Class: How the Elites Betrayed America's Working Men and Women,\" had a viral exchange with Bill Maher , who challenged her on her support for Trump on last Friday's installment of his HBO program \"Real Time.\"\n\nHe mistakenly referred to her as a \"conservative Republican.\"\n\n\"I was never a Republican or a conservative,\" Ungar-Sargon told Maher. \"I was a leftist, and I'm still a leftist. I'm just a MAGA leftist now because-\"\n\n\"That makes no sense,\" a perplexed Maher reacted.\n\nWhile her label did not ring true to Maher, it did to many others.\n\n\"Since I was on Bill Maher, I have gotten thousands, and I mean thousands, of messages from people saying, 'I am just like you. Thank you so much. That's who I am. That's what I am.' And these are the people who gave President Trump his victory,\" Ungar-Sargon told Fox News Digital. \"Because he wouldn't have won if he only got people who had voted Republican in 2020, in 2016. He won because he convinced millions of people in swing states and across the country that he had their best interests at heart, many of them who had been Democrats. And I guess that's who I speak for.\"\n\nUngar-Sargon defines \"MAGA leftist\" as someone who identifies with \"the labor left\" in believing that the working class \"is the backbone of any society, and their ability to achieve a middle-class standard of living is the defining feature of whether we will have a stable democracy or not.\"\n\n\"To me, that's sort of what 'left' means, along with all the other stuff being anti-war, being pro-free speech, you know, this was all, like, left stuff, and now it's MAGA stuff ,\" Ungar-Sargon said.\n\nThe independent journalist, who also wrote \"Bad News: How Woke Media Is Undermining Democracy,\" pushed back at the notion that she underwent a \"political evolution\" since she says her views haven't changed much.\n\nShe did, however, concede that she was once a \"woke leftist\" with severe \"Trump Derangement Syndrome.\"\n\nMorning Report and Evening Update: Your source for today's top stories\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\n\"In 2015, I hated him. In 2016, when he won, I stopped going to my favorite bar, Wheeler's, the local cop bar in Sheepshead Bay [in Brooklyn, New York], because everybody there had voted for him, and I felt that it was a personal betrayal,\" Ungar-Sargon admitted, laughing at herself. \"Like I was one of those lefties. I really had the derangement bad, ok? I'm embarrassed to say. Of course, now I'm back at Wheeler's more often than I should be, probably.\"\n\nWhat triggered her tectonic shift away from TDS didn't exactly involve Trump himself (though her pro-Trump Orthodox rabbi certainly helped).\n\nIt was a 2018 Yale University study that showed White liberals were more likely to dumb down their language when speaking to people of color compared to White conservatives.\n\n\"I remember when I read that I was so shook because I instantly recognized that it was true,\" Ungar-Sargon recalled. \"And it was an indictment of not just my milieu, but my entire worldview, which I immediately could recognize was built on the same thing that makes White liberals behave in such a racist way, which was this idea that Blacks and Hispanics are beneath us and need our help. Like, it's disgusting. But the entire progressive movement is really based on that idea.\"\n\n\"So I remember looking at that study and feeling like I'm about to lose all my friends because this is true, and it's undeniable, and it's an indictment of everything I think,\" she continued. \"And so I remember I put it in a desk drawer in my office. I closed the door and I said, 'I'm not ready to deal with the fallout here. I'm not ready to acknowledge this. I'll be back in three months.' And three months later, I came back, and I was like, 'Okay, what does this mean, Batya? Like, what does it mean you're wrong about?'\n\n\"And that sort of slowly started to change my perception of President Trump because this was such orthodoxy. Everything I thought was like, you know, the fundamentals of what I believed were so clearly wrong.  And again, you have this feeling of like, 'Well, if I'm wrong about this, what else might I be wrong about?'\"\n\nShe described the 2020 election as being a \"toss up\" with her vote ultimately being for Joe Biden.\n\nWhat the country underwent during the COVID pandemic, between how everyone was \"lied to\" about the virus and the harm lockdowns and vaccine mandates had on the working class, all done by the elites, was a deterrent for her to continue supporting the Democratic Party that she says has rejected her. Meanwhile, Trump was reshaping the Republican Party.\n\nAnd in doing so, she said, he built a coalition that included pro-life, pro-traditional marriage conservatives and pro-choice, pro-gay marriage leftists like herself.\n\n\"That is his genius, right? He looked at the party. He looked at the Reagan party, which was socially conservative, free trade and foreign interventions and foreign wars. And he had the confidence to say, 'That is not where the American people are at. They're not socially conservative, they're socially moderate. They support gay marriage, and they want there to be exceptions for abortion,'\" Ungar-Sargon said.\n\n\"Can you imagine the confidence to not only take on the Democrats, but to destroy and rebuild the GOP? People say [it's rebuilt] in his image, but it's not in his image. It's in the image of the American working class. On every issue. You look at the polling and President Trump is where 65 to 90% of Americans are at. And he just had the confidence to say, like, 'This is where the electorate is at. I love the American people, and I'm going to represent them.' And that is exactly what he did,\" she added.\n\nUngar-Sargon learned this first-hand while interviewing working-class Americans for her book \"Second Class,\" with many of them praising Trump's policies from his first term in office.\n\n\"People would make a very persuasive case to me about how his protectionist economic policies, specifically around trade and the border, had put money in their pockets and helped them become people who could aspire to the American dream once again after they had thought that that was really off the table for them,\" the author said. \"And I started to see the president as somebody who was a polarizing character only for the elites. But when you got out of the elites, he was actually a very unifying person who had a very unifying agenda when it came to kind of normies.\"\n\n\"And I really came to respect what he had done in terms of seeing through the interests of the elites that had been pushed for 50 years by both parties and saying, 'Actually, I'm going to take on the elites on both sides on behalf of the forgotten men and women of this great country,'\" she continued. \"And I think that I just could no longer deny that that was the real story, despite what all of us were told all the time about President Trump.\"\n\nThroughout her political journey, Ungar-Sargon felt welcomed by the MAGA movement, saying people would reach out and tell her, \"I don't agree with you about everything, but you are so welcome in this movement.\"\n\n\"And it's the exact opposite of the left. The left- if you agree with them on 99.9% of the issues, and you have a 0.1% disagreement on some issue, like, 'Yeah, maybe we shouldn't defund the police, how about reforming the police?' You are dead to them. You are out. They will do anything to destroy your life,\" she told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"And there's clearly an appetite within MAGA not just to be part of a multi-racial coalition, which I think a lot of people in the movement are very proud of, and not just to have people from all walks of life and all religions represented, but even to have people from all ideological walks of life. Itis a very welcoming movement for people who come at the abortion question, let's say, from a slightly different point of view. I mean, President Trump and JD Vance come at the abortion question from different points of view, and there's no reason that the GOP shouldn't be a big tent around this kind of beautiful diversity.\"\n\nIn the 2024 election, for the very first time, she voted for Trump, a decision she expressed zero regret for on \"Real Time.\"\n\n\"I mean, you must have a feeling in your gut- look me in the eye and tell me you don't- that this is really going badly, and I shouldn't have thrown my lot in with this team,\" Maher said to Ungar-Sargon, to which she replied, \"Oh, no, I feel the opposite.\"\n\nShe gave Maher credit for inviting her back on his show in what she called a \"genuine attempt\" at understanding why she and others continue to support Trump. She suspected the ideological disconnect may come down to pure economics.\n\n\"The argument that I made in both of my books was that for the leftist progressive elites, a lot of this is economic. And I'm not saying this about Bill [Maher] specifically, but I think as a class, their economic interests are very much at odds with those of the people that Trump represents,\" Ungar-Sargon said. \"They've made trillions of dollars collectively out of the open border, and they've been able to dress up the economic benefits of their progressivism as virtue while actually it's wage theft of their working-class neighbors, right? Because they can hire illegals instead of having to hire working-class people, which puts money back in their pockets. A lot of money.\"\n\nThe columnist went on to say that instead of strengthening the lower and middle classes, the liberal elite would rather \"raise the bar on what counts as poor and pay people off not to work.\"\n\n\"It's kind of like a plane, you know, and the knowledge industry, leftist elites, the over-credentialed, you know, multi-credentialed top 10% who now control 60% of the GDP, they're in first class,\" Ungar-Sargon said. \"And what they're basically saying to the American people is 'We're happy to pay your ticket, and you can fly on this plane for free as long as you stay in coach,' you know. 'Don't you dare use our bathrooms. And there's no upgrades. And you don't get to say where the plane is going. But as long as you're happy to sit in economy, you can sit there for free, and we'll pay your ticket.' That's really, like, the best metaphor for the Democratic Party right now.\"\n\nIn contrast, she said Trump understands his supporters don't want a free ride and want an economy that delivers a \"modest version of the American dream.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

We won't always be the best messengers, but we're still trying to meet people where they are, but also empower local organizations,\" she continued.\n\nIn addition, she said, the administration dispatched Dr. Anthony Fauci, despite his dismal approval ratings with conservatives, to make media appearances and promote the vaccines.\n\nWhile the White House hasn't had much trouble convincing Democrats and most independents to take any of the three COVID vaccines when it was their turn, Republicans have been a harder sell.\n\nAsked about that difficulty during a CNN appearance last month, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a Republican, blamed the hesitancy on \"a natural resistance to government.\"\n\n\"Well, I've thought a lot about that and I think it's a natural resistance to government and skepticism of it,\" Hutchinson told the network.\n\n\"You look at the breadth of support here in Arkansas for President Trump, and you have rural voters, you have minority voters and their hesitancy is worrisome, not just here but all across the country,\" he continued.\n\nHutchinson went on to share his prediction that the country was going to have an easy time reaching the 50 percent vaccination rate.\n\nThe problem, however, would come reaching 70 percent, which would bring the country to just under herd immunity.\n\n\"We're going to have a harder time getting from 50 percent to 70 percent, and it's about overcoming the skepticism,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast week, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) appealed directly to the men in his party, saying, \"I saw on some program last week that Republican men, curiously enough, might be reluctant to take the vaccine.\n\n\"I'm a Republican man, and I want to say to everyone: We need to take this vaccine. These reservations need to be put aside, because the only way - I think - we get to finally put this pandemic in the rearview mirror is with herd immunity,\" he continued, noting that would require 75 percent of Americans to be fully inoculated.\n\nMcConnell's comments, his second promoting the vaccine to Republican men, also earned the praise of the White House, which tweeted , \"Senator McConnell is right - and we thank him for his leadership.\""

      "text": "Ex-MSNBC host Tiffany Cross goes off on network about her treatment: I had my 'intelligence questioned'\n\nFormer MSNBC host Tiffany Cross said Thursday she faced \"constant criticism\" from network executives who questioned her intelligence and wanted her to be part of the anti-Trump \"echo chamber.\"\n\nMSNBC suddenly severed ties with Cross in November 2022, deciding not to renew her contract after two years.\n\nAt the time, an MSNBC source told Fox News Digital that the move was made because of \"repeated bad behavior on and off-air\" and \"bad judgment.\"\n\nCross, who hosted the weekend program \"The Cross Connection,\" told her side of the story on the latest episode of her new podcast, \"Native Land Pod,\" which she hosts alongside by former CNN contributor Angela Rye and former Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum.\n\nCross emerged as a regular guest host for Joy Reid's then-weekend MSNBC program which was \"really part of the audition process\" to land a paid gig at the network.\n\nShe was also invited to appear on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" to promote a book but said she ended up disagreeing with host Joe Scarborough on air; she later referred in the podcast to him as the network's \"favorite White boy.\"\n\n\"I got off air, we were trending. Every single time I did 'Morning Joe' we were trending,\" Cross said. \"Tiffany Cross was trending on 'Morning Joe.'\"\n\nCross said she was then selected by NBCUniversal News Group chairman Cesar Conde in 2020 to host a weekend show.\n\nShe told \"Native Land Pod\" listeners that she was \"obviously showing up for Black folks,\" but wanted to put on a show that could be consumed by people from different backgrounds, too.\n\n\"I want you all to know, every single week from the start of my show to the very last show I did, it was a battle,\" Cross said. \"It was a battle to cover things that I wanted to talk about. The network's philosophy was Trump, Trump, Trump. They wanted me to be part of the echo chamber.\"\n\nCross insisted she \"fought\" network honchos on a regular basis.\n\n\"I wanted to cover things like inhumane treatment in prisons, that's something that disproportionately impacts my community. Mental health among Black men, the erasure of Afro-Latinos in the Latino community, land battles of the indigenous, Native Americans trying to get their family artifacts back from museums right here in America. Black farmers, reaching Latino voters, things like that,\" Cross said.\n\n\"When I would fight these battles, I know ya'll know exactly what I mean, I was spoken to in the most condescending ways. I mean, anything from being told the definition of news... I would have somebody sit across from me and explain to me how news works,\" she continued. \"I had my intelligence questioned.\"\n\nCross reiterated that MSNBC only cared about coverage of then-President Trump.\n\n\"They wanted me to use the same recycled faces you see all the time, so I really found the constant criticism debilitating at times, but mostly confusing,\" Cross said, citing her program's ratings.\n\n\"We were routinely the highest rated show of the entire weekend,\" Cross said. \"So, I was scratching my head like 'What ya'll so mad about?'\"\n\nSmith said that her scripts were scrutinized and nitpicked by MSNBC executives who don't treat White males the same way.\n\n\"There is a burden to speaking the truth. It comes with consequence and when you find yourself as the messenger, there is a power structure in place that is not welcoming to our voices,\" Cross said. \"I was prepared for these battles because I had been fighting them my entire career.\"\n\nCross noted that Rashida Jones, a Black woman, was eventually brought in to run MSNBC. However, Cross said new leadership did not allow her to defend herself from criticism of her program.\n\nCross then said that her infamous reference of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas as \"Justice Pubic Hair on My Coke Can\" further irked leadership, as did her 2022 comment on Comedy Central that Florida should be \"castrated\" from the rest of the country.\n\n\"This was four days before [the 2022] midterms and one day before my show was going to air, we booked an exclusive sit down with Stacey Abrams... that morning I got a call from the president of the network saying they were not going to be renewing my contract, which was up in a month, and that my viewers would not even be given the courtesy or the respect of me not being able to sign off or have a final show,\" Cross said.\n\n\"When that happens, it suggests to other people in the industry that this person is so unhireable that we could not trust her with a live mic,\" she continued. \"The firing was very abrupt and it was very intentional to my audience, my viewers, that you are not the type of viewers that the company cares about. I was devastated when my show was canceled. I was so sad.\"\n\nCross said that she was never given a reason why she was dismissed but suspects that irking \"White conservatives\" played a role.\n\nShe also accused MSNBC of planting negative stories about her in the press that were \"filled with outright lies,\" and referenced reports that Jones tried to control the narrative about Cross' firing with a surprise visit to the set of \"The View\" in 2022.\n\n\"The network began attacking me,\" Cross said. \"They planted hit pieces in the press. The president of the network began a bizarre, unhinged tour where she was on damage control, I don't know what she was trying to do.\"\n\nMSNBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Vote totals show GOP faces major hurdle to woo black voters: The 'Selma effect'\n\nLeftist pundits have spent the weeks since November's election claiming that \"whiteness\" and racial grievance explain why Donald Trump is headed back to the White House - a hard sell when the president-elect assembled the most multi-racial coalition in Republican history, but it doesn't stop committed partisans from trying.\n\nTrump's victory does offer valuable lessons about the role race played in the election.\n\nBut neither party is asking the central question: Why is there such a disconnect between the ideological beliefs of black voters and their behavior on Election Day?\n\nAcross the electorate, nine in 10 self-identified liberals voted for Kamala Harris, exit polls found, while the same share of conservatives voted for Trump. Moderates were split, with roughly 60% voting Democratic and 40% voting Republican.\n\nNearly 80% of African American voters identify as either conservative or moderate, and if the connection between ideology and voting was the same for them as for other groups, Trump should have won roughly 40% of the black vote - but he came nowhere close.\n\nHe did just as well (13%) among black voters as in 2020, but lost black conservative voters to Kamala Harris by an 11-point margin, a glaring political anomaly.\n\nThe Democratic Party's success at positioning itself as the guardian of American civil rights - and the bulwark against a return to a time when African Americans lacked them - is a prime reason why black voters are such a political outlier.\n\nCall it the \"Selma effect.\"\n\nThe result has been the fusion of racial identity and political affiliation in a way that makes voting Democratic not just the \"right\" choice in the minds of progressive pundits, but also the black choice for millions of Americans.\n\nFor older African Americans in the Silent and Baby Boomer generations, the Selma effect is an ever-present and powerful reminder of what their lives were like in decades past, when racial segregation was enforced through law and social custom.\n\nOlder black voters are the most religious and socially conservative of all, yet they are even more likely to identify as Democrats than their younger counterparts.\n\nThe older black Christians who enthusiastically supported Harris might be surprised to know how many of their fellow Democrats see them as bigots for expressing traditional views on sexual orientation, gender identity, marriage and family.\n\nWhile black Millennials and Gen Z voters never experienced segregation firsthand, the Selma effect impacted them, too.\n\nThey were bombarded with messages during the presidential race smearing Trump as a racist bent on rolling back civil rights and giving police who kill black men in cold blood immunity from prosecution.\n\nSince Harris' loss, some progressives have gone even further: The Root recently published an article claiming that black voters are worrying that a second Trump administration will lead to the return of slavery.\n\nThis is completely on-brand for the political left.\n\nSubscribe to our daily Post Opinion newsletter!\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nDemocrats frequently link policies they don't like - from abortion restrictions to school choice - to white supremacy. Recall how President Biden floated the idea that Jim Crow, or even \"Jim Eagle,\" was making a comeback to take black people back to the days of poll taxes and separate water fountains.\n\nThe idea that voting Democratic is a sign of racial solidarity is rarely stated explicitly, but it is certainly enforced publicly among African Americans.\n\nBarack Obama publicly chastised black men who weren't supporting the Harris-Walz ticket, and the black men's summit that aired on BET shortly before the election featured several celebrities who connected voting for the vice president - and supporting abortion - to \"protecting\" black women more generally.\n\nThis way of thinking casts black Trump supporters as not just politically unsophisticated, but as self-hating race traitors.\n\nIt means that public support for Republicans comes at a high social and cultural cost for black voters, a cost that has no parallel for other groups.\n\nWhite conservatives and liberals don't find their \"whiteness\" questioned based on how they vote.\n\nThe Selma effect is not the sole explanation for black Americans' voting patterns. Those who live in urban areas where Democrats control every level of government have few opportunities to vote for conservative candidates.\n\nAnd Republicans must take responsibility for policies and rhetoric that fuel the perception that black voters aren't welcome.\n\nBut when close to 90% of black voters, from BLM activists and radical feminists to small business owners and Baptist preachers, support the same party, the GOP must wake up to the fact that something far beyond politics is walling a significant number of Americans off from its outreach.\n\nAnd that's no surprise, when Democrats have convinced even the most conservative pastor that getting \" souls to the polls \" is the only thing keeping his congregation from another Bloody Sunday.\n\nDelano Squires is a research fellow in the Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Life, Religion, and Family at the Heritage Foundation."

      "text": "NYC teacher: We're damaging kids with 'Critical Race Theory'\n\nPrivate school teacher Paul Rossi writes that we're doing a disservice by instilling \"Critical Race Theory\" on students. This essay was originally published on journalist Bari Weiss' Substack .\n\nI am a teacher at Grace Church High School in Manhattan. Ten years ago, I changed careers when I discovered how rewarding it is to help young people explore the truth and beauty of mathematics. I love my work.\n\nAs a teacher, my first obligation is to my students. But right now, my school is asking me to embrace \"antiracism\" training and pedagogy that I believe is deeply harmful to them and to any person who seeks to nurture the virtues of curiosity, empathy and understanding.\n\n\"Antiracist\" training sounds righteous, but it is the opposite of truth in advertising. It requires teachers like myself to treat students differently on the basis of race. Furthermore, in order to maintain a united front for our students, teachers at Grace are directed to confine our doubts about this pedagogical framework to conversations with an in-house \"Office of Community Engagement\" for whom every significant objection leads to a foregone conclusion. Any doubting students are likewise \"challenged\" to reframe their views to conform to this orthodoxy.\n\nI know that by attaching my name to this I'm risking not only my current job but my career as an educator, since most schools, both public and private, are now captive to this backward ideology. But witnessing the harmful impact it has on children, I can't stay silent.\n\nMy school, like so many others, induces students via shame and sophistry to identify primarily with their race before their individual identities are fully formed. Students are pressured to conform their opinions to those broadly associated with their race and gender and to minimize or dismiss individual experiences that don't match those assumptions. The morally compromised status of \"oppressor\" is assigned to one group of students based on their immutable characteristics. In the meantime, dependency, resentment and moral superiority are cultivated in students considered \"oppressed.\"\n\nAll of this is done in the name of \"equity,\" but it is the opposite of fair. In reality, all of this reinforces the worst impulses we have as human beings: our tendency toward tribalism and sectarianism that a truly liberal education is meant to transcend.\n\nRecently, I raised questions about this ideology at a mandatory, whites-only student and faculty Zoom meeting. (Such racially segregated sessions are now commonplace at my school.) It was a bait-and-switch \"self-care\" seminar that labelled \"objectivity,\" \"individualism,\" \"fear of open conflict\" and even \"a right to comfort\" as characteristics of white supremacy. I doubted that these human attributes - many of them virtues reframed as vices - should be racialized in this way. In the Zoom chat, I also questioned whether one must define oneself in terms of a racial identity at all. My goal was to model for students that they should feel safe to question ideological assertions if they felt moved to do so. It seemed like my questions broke the ice. Students and even a few teachers offered a broad range of questions and observations. Many students said it was a more productive and substantive discussion than they expected.\n\nHowever, when my questions were shared outside this forum, violating the school norm of confidentiality, I was informed by the head of the high school that my philosophical challenges had caused \"harm\" to students, given that these topics were \"life and death matters, about people's flesh and blood and bone.\" I was reprimanded for \"acting like an independent agent of a set of principles or ideas or beliefs.\" And I was told that by doing so, I failed to serve the \"greater good and the higher truth.\" He further informed me that I had created \"dissonance for vulnerable and unformed thinkers\" and \"neurological disturbance in students' beings and systems.\" The school's director of studies added that my remarks could even constitute harassment.\n\nA few days later, the head of school ordered all high school advisors to read a public reprimand of my conduct out loud to every student in the school. It was a surreal experience, walking the halls alone and hearing the words emitting from each classroom: \"Events from last week compel us to underscore some aspects of our mission and share some thoughts about our community,\" the statement began. \"At independent schools, with their history of predominantly white populations, racism colludes with other forms of bias (sexism, classism, ableism and so much more) to undermine our stated ideals, and we must work hard to undo this history.\"\n\nStudents from low-income families experience culture shock at our school. Racist incidents happen. And bias can influence relationships. All true. But addressing such problems with a call to \"undo history\" lacks any kind of limiting principle and pairs any allegation of bigotry with a priori guilt. My own contract for next year requires me to \"participate in restorative practices designed by the Office of Community Engagement\" in order to \"heal my relationship with the students of color and other students in my classes.\" The details of these practices remain unspecified until I agree to sign.\n\nI asked my uncomfortable questions in the \"self-care\" meeting because I felt a duty to my students. I wanted to be a voice for the many students of different backgrounds who have approached me over the course of the past several years to express their frustration with indoctrination at our school, but are afraid to speak up. They report that, in their classes and other discussions, they must never challenge any of the premises of our \"antiracist\" teachings, which are deeply informed by Critical Race Theory . These concerns are confirmed for me when I attend grade-level and all-school meetings about race or gender issues. There, I witness student after student sticking to a narrow script of acceptable responses. Teachers praise insights when they articulate the existing framework or expand it to apply to novel domains. Meantime, it is common for teachers to exhort students who remain silent that \"we really need to hear from you.\"\n\nBut what does speaking up mean in a context in which white students are asked to interrogate their \"white saviorism,\" but also \"not make their antiracist practice about them\"? We are compelling them to tiptoe through a minefield of double-binds.\n\nAccording to the school's own standard for discursive violence, this constitutes abuse. Every student at the school must also sign a \"Student Life Agreement,\" which requires them to aver that \"the world as we understand it can be hard and extremely biased,\" that they commit to \"recognize and acknowledge their biases when we come to school, and interrupt those biases,\" and accept that they will be \"held accountable should they fall short of the agreement.\"\n\nA recent faculty email chain received enthusiastic support for recommending that we \"'officially' flag students\" who appear \"resistant\" to the \"culture we are trying to establish.\" When I questioned what form this resistance takes, examples presented by a colleague included \"persisting with a colorblind ideology,\" \"suggesting that we treat everyone with respect,\" \"a belief in meritocracy,\" and \"just silence.\"\n\nIn a special assembly in February 2019, our head of school said that the impact of words and images perceived as racist - regardless of intent - is akin to \"using a gun or a knife to kill or injure someone.\" Imagine being a young person in this environment. Would you risk voicing your doubts, especially if you had never heard a single teacher question it?\n\nLast fall, juniors and seniors in my Art of Persuasion class expressed dismay with the \"Grace bubble\" and sought to engage with a wider range of political viewpoints. Since the BLM protests often came up in our discussions, I thought of assigning Glenn Loury , a Brown University professor and public intellectual whose writings express a nuanced, center-right position on racial issues in America. Unfortunately, my administration put the kibosh on my proposal.\n\nThe head of school responded to me that \"people like Loury's lived experience - and therefore his derived social philosophy\" made him an exception to the rule that black thinkers acknowledge structural racism as the paramount impediment in society. He added that \"the moment we are in institutionally and culturally, does not lend itself to dispassionate discussion and debate,\" and discussing Loury's ideas would \"only confuse and/or enflame students, both those in the class and others that hear about it outside of the class.\" He preferred I assign \"mainstream white conservatives,\" effectively denying black students the opportunity to hear from a black professor who holds views that diverge from the orthodoxy pushed on them.\n\nI find it self-evidently racist to filter the dissemination of an idea based on the race of the person who espouses it. I find the claim that exposing 11th and 12th graders to diverse views on an important societal issue will only \"confuse\" them to be characteristic of a fundamentalist religion, not an educational philosophy.\n\nMy administration says that these constraints on discourse are necessary to shield students from harm. But it is clear to me that these constraints serve primarily to shield their ideology from harm - at the cost of students' psychological and intellectual development. It was out of concern for my students that I spoke out in the \"self-care\" meeting, and it is out of that same concern that I write today. I am concerned for students who crave a broader range of viewpoints in class. I am concerned for students trained in \"race explicit\" seminars to accept some opinions as gospel, while discarding as immoral disconfirming evidence. I am concerned for the dozens of students during my time at Grace who shared with me that they have been reproached by teachers for expressing views that are not aligned with the new ideology.\n\nOne current student paid me a visit a few weeks ago. He tapped faintly on my office door, anxiously looking both ways before entering. He said he had come to offer me words of support for speaking up at the meeting.\n\nI thanked him for his comments, but asked him why he seemed so nervous. He told me he was worried that a particular teacher might notice this visit and \"it would mean that I would get in trouble.\" He reported to me that this teacher once gave him a lengthy \"talking to\" for voicing a conservative opinion in class. He then remembered with a sigh of relief that this teacher was absent that day.\n\nI looked him in the eyes. I told him he was a brave young man for coming to see me, and that he should be proud of that. Then I sent him on his way. And I resolved to write this piece.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Joe Biden looks like a loser on the eve of his State of the Union\n\nThere's a creepy video of Joe Biden this week in which he gets right in the face of a reporter who dares ask about his catastrophic poll numbers - and then he flat-out lies, as if presidential vehemence can overwhelm the truth.\n\nThe president was about to board Air Force One after another four-day weekend at Camp David.\n\n\"What's your message for Democrats who are concerned about your poll numbers?\" he was asked by one of the reporters waiting on the tarmac.\n\nBiden squinted and frowned before leaning into the lie: \"The last five polls you guys don't report. I'm winning! Five! Five in a row!\"\n\nWhat's he been smoking at Camp David?\n\nOn the eve of his State of the Union address Thursday, Biden looks like a loser.\n\nHis kingdom of lies is crumbling.\n\nAmericans belatedly are waking up to the border disaster he inflicted on the country, the rancor and division he stoked, the preposterous wokery he imposed on every corner of the government, the incompetence, the wars, the \"Bidenomics\" that translated to empty wallets.\n\nAlmost two-thirds of voters think the country is heading in the wrong direction, according to the latest New York Times-Siena College poll, one of four bad polls over the last week that show the stubborn verdict of the country is against Biden.\n\nHe's too old, too divisive, the country's going in the wrong direction and we're all worse off than we were under Donald Trump .\n\nIt's not the first time he's gaslit reporters about his horrible poll numbers.\n\nDo Biden's staffers encourage his fantasies by giving him pretend polls showing he's doing great?\n\nMaybe his choice of breakfast TV explains his delusional thinking.\n\nReportedly, he just loves MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\n\nYou can see why from this small sample of host Joe Scarborough's pungent political analysis this week:\n\n\"I undersold [Biden] when I said he was cogent ... He is better than he has ever been ... F-k you if you can't handle the truth. This version of Biden, intellectually, analytically, is the best Biden ever. Not a close second and I've known him for years ... If it weren't the truth, I wouldn't say it.\"\n\nLet's call it Joe's \"truth.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in the real world, Biden's fallen four points behind the dreaded Trump in the NYT-Siena poll, despite all the lawfare and slander Democrats have rained down on the former president's head.\n\nWhile 40% of voters said Trump's policies had helped them personally, just 18% said the same about Biden.\n\nA Fox News poll found 48% of voters say Biden's policies have hurt them, while only 32% say the same for Trump's.\n\nA CBS News/YouGov poll found almost half (46%) of voters say Trump's presidency is \"good\" and \"excellent,\" while only about one-third of voters say the same for Biden.\n\nFully 61% of voters say Biden is too old to be an effective leader - and that's not just a numerical verdict.\n\nHe is not a sprightly 81.\n\nHe is cognitively and physically falling apart in front of our eyes.\n\nHe has not developed wisdom with age.\n\nIf anything, he's more feckless and disengaged than ever.\n\nThe selfishness of clinging on for a second term is typical Biden, as is the fact that his handpicked DEI vice president offers no release valve.\n\nIt serves the Democrats right.\n\nThey rigged things to inflict this historically woeful president on the country and now are hoist by their own petard.\n\nBiden's inability to acknowledge fault and accept responsibility means there will be no policy reset Thursday night, just a refurbishing of the old narrative that it's all Trump's fault.\n\nBig, bad MAGA!\n\nDemocracy is at stake!\n\nCharacter is on the ballot!\n\nYeah, yeah, we've heard it all before.\n\nReportedly, Biden plans to offer a \"unity\" agenda.\n\nReally?\n\nAfter three years of inciting hatred against white conservatives and pitting Americans against each other for base political advantage, he's sticking to the story that he's a unifier?\n\nWill he apologize for opening the floodgates to the Third World's worst rapists, murderers, terrorists, con artists and freeloaders?\n\nWill he apologize to the family of Laken Riley ?\n\nWill he apologize to the horseback Border Patrol agents he falsely accused of whipping Haitian migrants?\n\nWill he apologize to the families of the 13 US military members killed in his botched Afghanistan withdrawal?\n\nStay up on the very latest with Evening Update.\n\nPlease provide a valid email address.\n\nBy clicking above you agree to the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy .\n\nNever miss a story.\n\nWill he apologize to the Secret Service agents attacked by his out-of-control German shepherds for months on end?\n\nWill he apologize for lying about his involvement in his son's influence-peddling schemes, and claiming Hunter's laptop was a \"Russian plant\"?\n\nOf course not.\n\nInstead, his campaign issued a statement after Trump's Super Tuesday victory clinched the Republican nomination.\n\n\"Donald Trump Limps Into the General Election as a Wounded, Dangerous and Unpopular Candidate.\"\n\nTrump is only limping and wounded because Biden's surrogates have been attacking him with lawfare.\n\nAnd how's that really working out?\n\nIn Georgia, Fani Willis has descended into farce.\n\nIn New York, Alvin Bragg's case rests on the word of perjurer and convicted felon Michael Cohen.\n\nJack Smith's classified document case was blown up by the kid-glove treatment of Biden's more egregious mishandling of top secret material.\n\nAnd the Supreme Court just put a stick in the wheel of Smith's insurrection frame-up.\n\nE. Jean Carroll is the best they can do.\n\nA nut who says rape is \"sexy\" and has a cat named Vagina.\n\nIt's an embarrassment.\n\nThey thought they could foist a subpar candidate on America for the second election in a row by crippling Trump legally and ruining him financially.\n\nBut the whole lawfare gambit backfired on them.\n\nThe more they piled on, the more his poll ratings went up.\n\nEven people who don't approve of Trump can see the injustice and know that they could be next.\n\nBiden's chickens finally are coming home to roost.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "No one cares that Britain's new PM is not white - except angry anti-racists\n\nRishi Sunak i s the first nonwhite British prime minister, and it has sent the Left into a meltdown.\n\nHe is, I keep seeing online, not properly Asian, because he is well off, well spoken, and privately educated.\n\nI should explain that. In the United Kingdom, \"Asian\" is an umbrella term for people from Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Nepalese, and Sri Lankan backgrounds. I know the word has different connotations in the United States, and I wouldn't bother making the point but for a racist rant by Ronny Chien, a presenter on The Daily Show, to the effect that \"Indians are not Asians, OK?\"\n\nTHE US-UK SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP FACES A CHINA TEST\n\nThe success of ethnic minority conservatives triggers a certain kind of left-winger. Some complain that Sunak's success is bad for Asians because he is not committed to higher state spending. Others are furious that, upon taking office, he praised \"the country I owe so much to.\" (\"He has basically internalized the old instruction to 'demonstrate your gratitude' so favored by racists and routinely directed at brown Britons,\" complained the writer Sathnam Sanghera.)\n\nAnd others have evolved a hideous theory about East African Asians (both of Sunak's parents were part of that industrious diaspora), arguing that they are not really people of color because the colonial hierarchy made them look down on black people.\n\nWhile all this ugliness is bubbling away on the Left, Sunak's race is a matter of almost complete indifference on the Right. He is hailed by some and denounced by others for scrapping his predecessor Liz Truss's scheduled tax cuts. But beyond some mild satisfaction that the Tories have lived up to their self-image as the party of hard work and opportunity, no one cares about the PM's ethnicity.\n\nI'm slightly annoyed at having to write about this at all, but I was pushed into it by another rant on The Daily Show - this one by the mixed-race South African comedian Trevor Noah titled \"Unpacking the Backlash to Rishi Sunak.\"\n\n\"You hear a lot of people saying, 'Oh, they're taking over. Indians are going to take over Great Britain and what's next?'\" Noah declaimed to cretinous cheers from his audience.\n\nYou do? Really? A lot of people? I guess I must be talking to the wrong people, but what do I know? I just live here.\n\nThis being 2022, Noah then swerved into some babyish anticolonialism, complaining that Charles III is the king of Jamaica. Well, yes, he is, because that's how successive Jamaican governments have wanted to keep things.\n\nLumping racism and colonialism together glosses over, for example, the way the keenest supporters of slavery in the U.S., much like the architects of apartheid in Noah's native South Africa, rejected colonialism precisely because they disliked London's inclinations toward racial equality. It ignores, too, the extent to which colonialism in Africa was driven by antislavery activists.\n\nThat, however, is just a minor quibble. The more serious criticism of the Left's reaction to Sunak's win - The Daily Show is an outlier, but not by much - is that it is based on a fantasy. The Conservative Party has given Britain its only Jewish prime minister, its only three female prime ministers, and now, its first Hindu prime minister.\n\nAll that Noah could find by way of evidence was a single racist nutter on a radio call-in - a nutter who went viral precisely because what he said was so jarring. To be clear, that's one nutter in a nation of 68 million people.\n\nOver the summer, Sunak was one of 11 candidates contesting the Tory leadership. Six of the 11 were not white. True, the members picked Truss, a white woman, in the runoff. But their preferred candidate, according to every poll, was Kemi Badenoch, a black woman brought up mainly in Nigeria. Do those on the Left, I wonder, ever look at this and ask themselves whether affirmative action is all it's cracked up to be?\n\nI've complained before about how British media tend to import America's racial language. White conservatives are called \"Klansmen.\" Black conservatives are called \"Uncle Toms.\" The Black Lives Matter narrative was replicated without modification, resulting in the hilarious sight of white protesters shouting, \"Hands up, don't shoot,\" at unarmed London police officers. It is no exaggeration to say that British media were more excited by President Barack Obama's victory than by Sunak's.\n\nI suspect that it is precisely this lack of interest that most infuriates the woke. It is bad enough for conservatives to beat them on the only metric they care about. But for them to do so with an indifferent shrug must be intolerable."

      "text": "The folly of trying to fight racism with hatred\n\nWhite people, and especially white conservatives, could use more empathy for black people.\n\nIt's too bad some writers think white conservatives' real problem is that they have too much empathy for everyone else.\n\nElie Mystal, in the Nation , writes that I am part of a \"cadre of white pundits [that] are busy sniping about the 'hypocrisy' of protesters who don't socially distance.\"\n\nThat is false. Read my piece , which Mystal quoted and linked, and you won't find me criticizing protesters for \"hypocrisy,\" lack of social distancing, or anything of the sort. Mystal's is just the sort of misrepresentation one expects in sloppy polemics, so allow me to reiterate what my offending article actually argued: If the coronavirus spreads in outdoor settings, these protests will prove to be \"superspreader events.\" If they don't, then the lockdowns on other outdoor activities, such as fishing, are obviously pointless limitations on people's freedom that don't have any connection to health outcomes.\n\nMystal took me to be saying something far worse: \"I can't tell if these people are hoping black people get Covid-19 to punish them for daring to question the police,\" he wrote about J.D. Vance and me, \"or hoping people don't get Covid-19 so they can get a pedicure.\"\n\nAmid national racial strife, it takes extraordinary indecency to publish such hateful garbage - to casually suggest I am hoping black people (and in particular the people I had spent probably 15 hours talking to, photographing, and standing amid) get a deadly virus. Mystal heaps on still more misrepresentation with his suggestion that I have an animus against those who \"question the police.\"\n\nBut it is the second half of Mystal's cute, casual accusation of vile racism that is, in a way, more important. It reflects an ugly and counterproductive but increasingly common rhetorical tactic.\n\nMystal characterized my desire to see lockdowns end as me just hoping I \"can get a pedicure.\" At first, I took that as a cutesy turn of phrase. But when I pushed back against Mystal on Twitter, I realized the \"pedicure\" line was something else. It was disdain. It was contempt.\n\nMystal quoted a different part of my piece, but over Twitter, he let on that this was the part that really pissed him off:\n\n\"Some Democratic politicians who crack down on commerce and religious worship are pretty clear that they don't think coronavirus rules matter anymore if the cause is righteous.\n\n\"Religious people and shop owners have good reason to be upset.\"\n\nWhen Mystal said I posited a \"false equivalence\" between lockdown protesters and the police violence protesters, I pointed out that wasn't true. Then he wrote this:\n\nI have now addressed my problems with your article, twice. Maybe have less of a hard on about \"Religious people and shop owners\" next time in the Examiner, and your allegedly *true* intentions will come through?\n\n- Elie Mystal (@ElieNYC) June 12, 2020\n\nAnd there it is. The ill intent that Mystal claimed I held toward protesters was entirely in his mind and nowhere in my writing. My real offense wasn't that I didn't love the protesters, but that I didn't hate the shopkeepers and religious people .\n\nSmall-business owners have had their livelihood, their occupation, and frankly, their lives, many of them black lives, pulled away from them. Religious people have had their spiritual infrastructure and support system stripped from beneath them. Parents and families who have lost schools, main streets, playgrounds, and parks are genuinely suffering.\n\nSome folks think their suffering is so minor that we ought to just laugh it off. Actually, no - that we ought to belittle it and hold it in contempt.\n\nMost people, when confronting oppression and suffering, want the oppression and suffering ended. Others just want the oppression and suffering more thoroughly distributed.\n\nMystal ends with this to ice the cake:\n\nI hope we can come to some sort of accord about... [Clicks on Washington Examiner. Sees \"Sympathy For Cops, by Tim Carney\"] oh Jesus just go back under the bridge, I'm done paying your troll tax.\n\n- Elie Mystal (@ElieNYC) June 12, 2020\n\nThat's correct. I wrote a piece in which I laid out the suffering of cops - white and black cops who had been murdered; black cops who had to stand for hours while white protesters called them racists to their faces; cops who saw their precincts burned to the ground; cops ordered needlessly by the Trump administration to clear a street of peaceful protesters; cops who are forced to take the blame for their worst colleagues half a country away and even for centuries of inequality and racism.\n\nI wrote: \"It's not a popular thing to say, but it's especially true these days, and we can say it without diminishing the legitimate complaints about police brutality: These are tough days to be a police officer, and if we have empathy or sympathy to spare, we ought to parcel some out to these men and women in uniform.\"\n\nApparently, that's unforgivable. That's the line that caused Mystal to tell me to buzz off. Mystal is only interested in your arguments if you laugh at the suffering of religious people and small-business owners, and of course, if you refuse to extend sympathy to cops.\n\nIt seems to me that Mystal's line of argument is an error - and a grave one. We aren't going to become a more just or fair society by curbing our love and empathy. Quite the opposite."

      "text": "Washington Post should atone for its race-based smear of Clarence Thomas\n\nThe casual racism of the establishment media has been around forever. And for more than 30 years, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has been a particular target of the liberals' racist animus.\n\nA Wednesday Washington Post feature on House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, full of liberal shading throughout , contains a supreme example of the sort of snide racism that liberal elites seem to think is not just acceptable but enlightened.\n\nIn quoting Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, writers Cleve Wootson Jr. and Marianna Sotomayor produced this doozy of a sentence: \"'If you know that a person has been vetted by Jim Clyburn, you know that person won't go to the court and end up being a Clarence Thomas,' [said Thompson,] referring to the Black justice whose rulings often resemble the thinking of White conservatives.\"\n\nRepublican U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas saw the sentence and reacted appropriately in a tweet calling it \"a disgusting smear by the Washington Post against the great Justice Thomas. Justice Thomas has a distinguished 30-year record on the Court, but to the Post, he merely 'resemble[s] the thinking of White conservatives.'\"\n\nIndeed, the short sentence is objectionable in multiple ways. First, race has nothing to do with the subject. Thomas' rulings have no color to them - his constitutional conservatism owes nothing to ethnicity. To say otherwise is to insult both Thomas individually and conservatism as a governing philosophy.\n\nSecond, the way the sentence is constructed, by mentioning Thomas' race in light of \"the thinking of White conservatives,\" creates a clear inference that Thomas' thought is subordinate to that of conservatives who are white. For anyone even remotely familiar with the fierce independence and clarion consistency of Thomas' work, this is nonsense bordering on defamation.\n\nFinally, to say that Thomas' work \" resembles \" that of \"White conservatives\" carries the inference that Thomas' work is not just subordinate to but also derivative of white thinkers. Again, this is outrageous. Thomas' rulings \"resemble\" nobody else's. Thomas writes in distinctive prose with forceful logic and rigorous scholarship, creating a style that is readily identifiable for clarity and its rare combination of intellectual thoroughness with succinctness .\n\nThis is all par for the course from leftist self-styled elites. For them, race is a defining characteristic, and minorities who do not think according to the Left's assumptions about how they should think are assumed to be doing the white man's bidding. These assumptions are pervasive in establishment media and academia, but they should be offensive to blacks and whites alike. They are assumptions that subsume individuality to race. In sum, they are, by the appropriate definition, textbook \"racism.\"\n\nThe Post should apologize for its smear, and it should reprimand both the reporters and all who edited the article while leaving the offensive characterization intact. Journalists need to learn that the way to stop making racist assumptions is to stop trying to assign particular thought patterns to particular races."

      "text": "Racism, censorship, and sexism: The price of being conservative in college\n\nF aced with racism , censorship, and sexism, life for a conservative on an American college campus is harder than ever, according to students from around the country.\n\nWith few allies for them at school, conservative students have come to the 2022 Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, to tell their stories.\n\n\"It's not fun. We've been persecuted several times,\" Preston Parra, a 20-year-old student at the University of West Georgia said. \"I actually had to take a case up to the vice president. I didn't report anyone specifically, but I was called a racial slur on campus.\"\n\nWATCH: 'FREEDOM CONVOY' TRUCKER REACTS TO BEING BEATEN BY OTTAWA POLICE\n\nEveryone expects white conservatives to be racist, he said, but Parra, who is of Colombian descent, endures the most attacks from his campus's self-proclaimed liberals and other people of color, including the individuals who called him the slur, he said.\n\n\"They happened to actually be black. You see all the time in the media that white people are portrayed as the enemy and the most racist, but growing up as a brown kid in middle school and elementary school, I got bullied more from people of my own color or black people than I ever did by white people,\" Parra said. \"So it's very important we see there is such a double-standard when it comes to racism. People are going around saying the N-word on the liberal side of things, but if you ever heard it on the conservative side, it is a blowup.\"\n\n\"I, myself, am brown. I come from a minority community, and I reported [the incident] to the vice president. I told him, 'Hey, this is going on on campus. It's got to stop.' He nominated me as chairman of the code of conduct board,\" he continued.\n\nMany conservatives do not feel comfortable speaking up, but doing so can put them in positions to make change, Parra said.\n\nSexism is another major challenge facing conservatives, especially women, on America's campuses, according to Rachel Ress, a student at Florida Atlantic University.\n\nRess, 19, said she was originally slated by the school to live in the same residence as a male student.\n\nWhen she explained to school officials that the arrangement made her uncomfortable, she said they said the only thing wrong with the situation was her attitude.\n\n\"I was housed initially with a boy and told that I was the problem because of my Christianity and not wanting to embrace the situation,\" according to Ress.\n\n\"I was like, 'I'm a girl. I want to be with girls.' I had never had an experience like that. I'm glad we sorted it out, but it was hard to be shamed for traditional values in such an untraditional setting.\"\n\nGeorgetown University is an example of a left-leaning school that can be unwelcoming to tradition, according to 22-year-old Andrew Alfonso.\n\n\"There's definitely a lot of assh**** and a lot of real aggression coming from kids on more of the Left,\" Alfonso said. \"I know one time we had a conservative speaker on campus, and a lot of kids ended up protesting that, and it got pretty ugly.\n\n\"We've kind of been siloed,\" he continued. \"It can definitely be difficult at times.\"\n\nInside the classroom, life doesn't get easier for conservatives, several students lamented.\n\n\"There are some times where I will want to write an essay about one thing, and then I have to hold myself back,\" Deanna Mancuso, a 20-year-old FAU student, said.\n\nCensorship, whether it be imposed by professors or the students themselves, is a common denominator among America's institutions for higher learning, students agreed.\n\n\"I definitely feel at times I can't portray who I am completely because of the fear of judgment,\" said 19-year-old Dalia Calvillo of FAU.\n\n\"But that is something you have to deal with, and you always have to stand up for yourself.\"\n\nParra echoed Calvillo's sentiment.\n\n\"Many times, professors have tried to censor us on campus. We're not letting that happen,\" he said. \"We're fighting against it, we're shining a light on it, and we're publicizing it. That's the key. You have to publicize all this stuff.\"\n\nCPAC offers young conservatives the chance to learn about tools they can take back with them and use to make a difference at their schools and in their communities, according to Parra.\n\n\"I came to CPAC last year and took back a lot of values then,\" he said. \"So now I'm running for [state House] District 64 in Georgia, and we're just doing everything we can to make sure we are preserving all the values that are important to true God-loving Americans.\"\n\nBoth Calvillo and Mancuso said they want to use what they learn in Orlando to become better leaders on campus.\n\n\"I hope to learn a little bit more about what it takes to be a great leader and show that at my university,\" Calvillo said.\n\nIt's not just important to be a leader, Mancuso argued . A leader \"has to be someone who is unapologetically who they are.\""

      "text": "Conservatives should be more racially sensitive\n\nL ike it or not, the George Zimmerman-Trayvon Martin story has triggered a national conversation about race. President Obama waded into the controversy with much-hyped remarks on the incident July 19, which provoked a harsh reaction from some conservatives. I'm inclined to agree with the Daily Beast's Kirsten Powers that this reaction is indicative of why Republican outreach efforts to minority groups are unlikely to succeed.\n\nThe problem, I think, is not widespread racism, but enough examples of racial insensitivity to create the impression that conservatives don't care about the African American community.\n\nIf somebody is going to criticize anything about Obama's speech, I could see how one might argue it was fluff that tried to assuage both sides without saying much. But personally, as I said at the time, I thought he struck the right tone. And I don't get the accusation that Obama was engaging in race-baiting.\n\nWhat Obama was doing was attempting to calm a racially-charged situation, by both stating that there was a fair trial and calling for non-violence, while trying to explain why the episode struck such a raw nerve within the African American community.\n\nFor conservatives frustrated when liberals act like race relations are trapped in 1862 or 1962, Obama recognized that things continue to get better. But that doesn't mean that there aren't some relevant historical realities or that African Americans don't face ongoing struggles.\n\nIt isn't engaging in victimology to appreciate that the African American experience in America is unlike that of any other group. While many Americans can look back at family stories of their ancestors coming over to the country in search of a better life, overcoming adversity, and seeing their families' fortunes improve through the generations, African Americans were originally brought over here against their will in chains and brutally forced into slavery.\n\nThen, after becoming \"free,\" they were subjected to sanctioned discrimination for a century.  Yes, things have improved dramatically. But if you're an African American teenager who knows that his ancestors were slaves and his grandparents' generation had to sit in the back of the bus and drink from separate water fountains, that legacy is going to have an enduring effect.\n\nAs Obama acknowledged, African Americans commit a disproportionate number of crimes in America. But there's also evidence that they are disproportionately sent to prison, especially for non-violent offenses such as drug crimes\n\nThere may be a rational basis for a white guy in a suit to feel wary about walking through a predominately black inner-city neighborhood at night. But for the overwhelming majority of blacks who are law-abiding citizens, it becomes demeaning when whites look over their shoulders or clutch their belongings at the sight of black males.\n\nSo, all Obama was trying to say was that - without even getting into the legal details - this is the prism through which African Americans viewed the Martin shooting.\n\nConservatives often are angered by the false accusations of racism coming from liberals, and assume they'll get tagged as racists whatever they say. And it's true, I suppose, that in some quarters, merely being in favor of limited government, or opposing national health care, or advocating federalism, makes one a racist.\n\nBut the correct response to this is not to simply throw caution to the wind and be dismissive of any suggestion that racism still exists in America. There's plenty of room for white conservatives, without surrendering their limited government beliefs, to at least be sensitive to the historical struggles of African Americans as well as the ones they still face, and to apply an extra level of scrutiny to what they say and write regarding race.\n\nWill this change voting patterns? Perhaps not. But one thing is for sure. In the current environment, arguments conservatives make about the dangers of government dependency, the problems with out-of wedlock-births, or the benefits of school choice - no matter how genuine or heartfelt - are reflexively viewed with suspicion by African Americans and treated as coded racism.\n\nUntil conservatives can broadly learn to speak about race with more compassion and sensitivity, the African American outreach effort is, as Powers writes, likely a lost cause."

      "text": "The world is being infected by America's race pathology\n\nT hroughout my life, I have watched the world become more American . On every continent, people learn English, watch U.S. films , wear blue jeans, and aspire to live in pluralist, capitalist, and individualist societies. The dissemination of American values was one of the happiest facts of the 20th century. But I fear that the 21st century has brought an altogether darker cultural export.\n\nThe core American value used to be freedom . Freedom of speech meant no one could drag you to jail for saying the wrong thing. Freedom of assembly meant no one could close down a political party, labor union, or church congregation for sedition. People chose their jobs, their homes, their spouses. America was \"conceived in liberty,\" and when countries escaped fascism in 1944, or communism in 1989, they aspired to be more like America.\n\nThat was then. Starting in the late 20th century and accelerating terrifyingly around 2015, the United States has switched from elevating individual rights to elevating group rights. It has, in other words, returned to the tribal thinking that its creation was intended to defy. The precepts that drove the campaign for civil rights - race doesn't define you, everyone is equal before the law, character trumps skin color - are now deemed reactionary and offensive. Ethnic differences (and, to a lesser degree, differences of sex, sexuality, and so forth) are deemed supremely important. They define your place in an imagined hierarchy of privilege and determine what you can say, what college scores you need, and what positions you can occupy.\n\nWe can argue about the origins of this tendency. Did it come from the notions of guilt and justification that animated the earliest settlers? (\"I think I can see the whole destiny of America contained in the first Puritan who landed on those shores,\" wrote Alexis de Tocqueville.) Did it arrive later, brought by socialist German academics? Or was it an overcorrection, a reaction to the ugliness of slavery and segregation?\n\nWhatever its genesis, the American virus has leaked out and become a global pandemic. Across the West, especially in other white-majority, English-speaking countries, social questions are now seen through the distorting prism of America's civil rights struggles.\n\nIn Britain, Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. are (along with Nelson Mandela) among the most familiar historical figures, with hundreds of classrooms and junior schools named after them. Almost any British child can identify them, whereas perhaps one in a hundred could tell you anything about, say, John Locke.\n\nOur vocabulary has become Americanized. People talk of \"all-white juries\" as though there are alternatives in chunks of rural Britain. Race relations are presented in Black Lives Matter's terms, although black people in Britain are just 3.3% of the population, less than half as numerous as, say, South Asians.\n\nEven if we accepted the fundamentally illiberal premise of a universal black experience or a universal white experience, there is no real comparison between the American South and the rest of the Anglosphere.\n\nThere were very few black people in Britain before 1948. The first arrivals from the Caribbean had, in many cases, served patriotically in World War II and did not regard themselves as immigrants at all. Slavery was abolished in all of Britain's colonies a generation before the U.S. Civil War. In the mother country, a court ruling in 1772 had established that any slave brought to Britain was free the moment he set foot on our soil.\n\nYet, to this day, white conservatives in Britain are trolled with images of burning crosses and Klansmen's hoods, while black conservatives are called Uncle Toms and house Negroes. Quite apart from being terrifically rude, what have these things got to do with Britain?\n\nIt all comes down to the extraordinary cultural reach of American media. We watch not just The West Wing , House of Cards , and Veep , but nonpolitical dramas and comedies that shape our sense of current affairs, from Billions to The Simpsons .\n\nI have written before about how the understandable American squeamishness about blackface now dictates that white British actors can't play black roles - a wholly imported taboo. I have written about how the American Left's anathematization of the term \"Anglo-Saxon\" has spilled over into the United Kingdom.\n\nSome British universities have even, hilariously, picked up the acronym BIPOC - though the indigenous people represented by the \"I\" are, in Britain, white. Nothing, though, beats Britain's BLM protests, which saw largely white crowds shouting, \"Hands up, don't shoot!\" at unarmed London coppers.\n\nEven in the U.S., bringing people up with inherited grievances based on how they look strikes me as dreadful. But for the rest of the world to be importing someone else's quarrel is beyond tragic."

      "text": "America's story is ultimately about liberty, not slavery\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis's decision to block a draft version of an AP African American history course, and College Board's subsequent decision to amend the course, have elicited cries that DeSantis is keeping students from knowing the real (ostensibly racist) history of the United States.\n\nOver at the Washington Post , Adam Laats declares that \"by making it unacceptable to teach the truth of America's racial history - even when the historical facts are unambiguous - conservatives have managed to ensure that students learn even less.\"\n\nINSIDE RON DESANTIS'S WAR WITH THE COLLEGE BOARD OVER AP AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES\n\nUnsurprisingly, Laats didn't stop with arguing that conservatives are trying to hide history. Instead, he resorted to the now routine tendency to associate any policy unpopular on the Left with the Confederacy, and later the KKK, noting, \"In the 1920s, White conservatives in organizations such as the American Legion and the Ku Klux Klan expanded this campaign across the entire country.\"\n\nAnd yet, Laats undercuts his case that this is some sort of post-Confederate legacy by noting that \"states such as Wisconsin, Oregon, New York, and New Jersey passed laws or considered bills to ban books\" their respective legislatures viewed as inappropriate for high schoolers or inconsistent with the civil catechesis of those respective states.\n\nTextbooks that sought to center slaveholding and racism were generally rejected: \"In the eyes of conservatives in organizations such as the Daughters of the American Revolution, American Legion, and Ku Klux Klan, such questioning was anathema, a treasonous attack on America's uniquely heroic past.\" Laats also appears infuriated that conservatives might offer a different reading of America's past.\n\nLaats's association of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the American Legion - a group that included scores of black American chapters in the years after its founding in 1919 - with the Klu Klux Klan and his rendering the Klan's commitments as \"conservative\" betray the unseriousness of his charge that DeSantis's decision is downstream from the Confederacy.\n\nWhen the conflict over slavery heated up in the U.S. Congress in the 1830s, Southerners feared the distribution of literature from anti-slavery Northerners. The mere suggestion that slavery was not the normal condition of mankind elicited Southern fears. Northern congressmen increasingly argued that the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were committed to the ideals of equality.\n\nIn 1837, John C. Calhoun argued that slavery was a positive good that deserved to be preserved.\n\nBooks that taught freedom was an American birthright were burned. Southerners even imposed a gag rule whereby anti-slavery petitions from Northern communities - often grounded in the language of America's founding documents - were immediately tabled in the House of Representatives. Antebellum Southerners were committed to the same thing as Laats: keeping the history of emancipation, freedom, and liberty activated by the Revolutionary generation away from potential learners.\n\nLaats's open admission that Northern states pursued the same course of action as the states of the former Confederacy reveals the fact that, across the entire county, most white Americans believed that relating the history of the American revolution with an emphasis on the intellectual and political ideas relating to human freedom should be a priority for young people.\n\nBlack Americans felt the same way.\n\nFrederick Douglass revered what he called the great principles of the Declaration of Independence and the genius of American institutions. A commitment to ideas of the Revolution is what allowed black men and women to achieve freedom from slavery in the Civil War, and what would allow them to gain greater civil rights in the following century.\n\nThe politicization of history in recent years and its tendency toward partisan activism has led to the assumption that history curricula ought to emphasize the United States as particularly racist and immoral. Yet societies tell stories that emphasize their values. Since schools teach students what their respective societies see as valuable, secondary schools are and have always been the chief institutions for catechesis.\n\nFor most of its history, the United States has identified human liberty and the ideas of the Revolutionary generation as essential for maintaining a free republic. Yet this does not require or condone denying inequality or any immoral aspects of American history.\n\nDeSantis seems to understand this principle. He has chosen to tell the story of human liberty; Laats wants him to tell the Confederacy's story of racism and slavery.\n\nMiles Smith IV is an assistant professor of history at Hillsdale College."

      "text": "'Defund the police' cost Democrats Hispanic and black votes\n\nCassandra usually turned out to be right. So has David Shor, the Democratic Cassandra who was fired last June from his job as a poll analyst for the Joe Biden polling firm Civis Analytics for tweeting, after rioting broke out from a Minneapolis suspect's death in police custody May 25, that violent rioting in 1968 cost Democrats enough votes to lose that year's presidential election.\n\nThat was a message the woke Twitteratti didn't want to hear; they wanted to cheer on the \"mostly peaceful\" (i.e., often violent) riots in cities across the country. But it turns out Shor's point was well taken. Democrats' cheers for last summer's violent riots and their support of \"defunding the police\" cost Biden precious votes, nearly enough to defeat him despite his 7 million popular vote plurality, especially among non-white voters.\n\nThat's the conclusion of Shor, who turns 30 this year and is now with the left-wing nonprofit group OpenLabs, based on close study of election returns down to the precinct level and special post-election polling, as relayed in two interviews with New York magazine's Eric Levitz. And his analysis applies not only to the 2020 election and the particular persona of Donald Trump, but also to elections in years ahead.\n\nShor's analysis of precinct returns has him revising the exit poll slightly. Comparing Biden's performance with Hillary Clinton's, he tells Levitz, \"Democrats gained somewhere between half a percent to 1 percent among non-college whites and roughly 7 percent among white college graduates (which is kind of crazy). Our support among African Americans declined by something like 1 to 2 percent. And then Hispanic support dropped by 8 to 10 percent. The jury is still out on Asian Americans.\"\n\n\"The [strikingly large] decline in Hispanic support for Democrats,\" he says, \"was pretty broad based. This isn't just about Cubans in south Florida. It happened in New York and California and Arizona and Texas.\"\n\nDemocratic declines were particularly sharp among those with backgrounds in Venezuela and Colombia, who dislike the \"socialism\" which Republicans charged that Democrats favor. But more generally, unlike in the past, \"non-white conservatives voted for Republicans at higher rates; they started voting more like white conservatives.\"\n\nThis matches my own observations that white liberals have become a much larger part of the Democratic coalition, and they have blandly assumed that \"People of Color\" voters share their views on every issue. That's not so, Shor argues. \"White liberals are more left-wing than black and Hispanic Democrats on pretty much every issue: taxes, health care, policing, and even on racial issues or various forms of 'racial resentment.' So as white liberals increasingly define the party's image and messaging, that's going to turn off non-white conservative Democrats and push them against us.\"\n\nAmong white liberals, Shor says, \"racism has been defined in highly ideological terms. And this theoretical perspective\" has become \"a big part\" of white college-credentialed Democrats' \"group identity.\" But blacks and Hispanics have a different perspective. \"If you look at the concrete questions, white liberals are to the left of Hispanic Democrats, but also of Black Democrats, on defunding the police and those ideological questions about the source of racial inequity.\"\n\nI would put this more concretely. White college Democrats tend to live in neighborhoods, high-income suburbs, gentrified parts of central cities, where issues of violent crime and rioting are theoretical. They have security guards and doormen and sympathetic police officers to assure them they won't be bothered. Hispanics and blacks, including the minorities of these groups who have conservative views, are seldom similarly protected. Rioting is not theoretical to them, it's a real threat.\n\nWhite gentry liberals are happy to believe assurances of the New York Times and CNN that the post-May 25 demonstrations were \"mostly peaceful\" and justified by \"systemic racism,\" which, the Times assures us, goes back to 1619. For Hispanics and black homeowners, who live in bungalows without doormen and work and shop in neighborhoods without private security guards, those reassurances ring hollow.\n\nWhite liberals have been happy to assume that \"People of Color\" all have similar perspectives and similar views on issues. Such thinking goes back to the creation of the term \"Hispanic\" by the Nixon administration Census Bureau and the assumption that Hispanics and Asians, as non-whites, would be subject to the same kind of discrimination and bad treatment that black people experienced for many years.\n\nThat assumption is simply factually wrong, as Shor's analysis inferentially recognizes. Most Hispanics these days, or their parents or grandparents, came to the at least a decade after passage of the Civil Rights Acts of the 1960s. And most of these people did not move into heavily black neighborhoods, but rather headed for parts of metropolitan areas or small communities inhabited largely by blue-collar whites.\n\nA cursory look at the patterns revealed in the brilliant New York Times interactive graphic Mapping the Census , proves my point. In the one heavily black area where Hispanic immigrants did move, South Central Los Angeles, Hispanics now outnumber blacks.\n\nSimilarly, if you map the sites of murders, and we have seen a vast increase in murders, the largest yearly percentage increase ever recorded, since last May 25, you find the biggest clusters in majority black areas, with much smaller numbers in majority Hispanic areas. The sad fact is that violent crime rates among blacks are about eight times those among whites and probably at least double those among Hispanics (FBI crime statistics, unlike most government statistics, don't tabulate Hispanic numbers separately).\n\nMany white college-credentialed liberals kind of like the idea of \"defunding the police.\" After all, cutting police budgets may free up money for holders of social work or teaching degrees. But for many Hispanic and black voters, defunding the police means immediately putting their and their family's lives at risk and, in the long term, probably destroying neighborhood institutions and amenities. Drive around my hometown of Detroit and you can see what years of high rates of violent crime can do to a city. Detroit attracted few Hispanic immigrants and has been experiencing black flight since 1990. Toleration of violent crime and fostering of welfare dependency, as I argued in my most recent Washington Examiner column , have done horrifying damage in my lifetime and now, alas, threaten to do so again.\n\nThe Democratic Party, as I wrote in my book How America's Political Parties Change (and How They Don't) , has always been a coalition of out-groups - people not seen as typical Americans but who, taken together, can form a majority. Historically, it has always had problems when there's been disagreement on major issues among its different constituencies. Shor has identified what many Democrats, including those who got him fired last summer, haven't wanted to face. The liberalism on racial issues of the whites who increasingly dominate Democratic messaging, a liberalism based on theoretical rather than concrete concerns, is a political liability among many of the \"People of Color\" whose large Democratic percentages the party has come to depend on. Shor's thesis gets support from Nate Silver , and, in hedged wording, from none less than Barack Obama .\n\nMy sense is that Democrats' problem here is not just on the 2020 issues that Shor identifies. White college-credentialed liberals are a constituency inevitably because of their affluence and their freedom from imposed constraints, focused on ideas that are theoretical for them.\n\nCollege-credentialed conservatives have always had a concrete interest in at least one issue (taxes), but their increasingly numerous liberal counterparts have been willing since the 1990s to pay higher taxes in return for legally available abortions (which they seldom avail themselves of) and restrictions on police conduct (from whose consequences they believe themselves safely insulated).\n\nA politics centered on differences on economic issues is one susceptible to compromise and adjustment: you just argue about how to split the differences. A politics centered on moral values and personal concerns is one in which differences can't be so readily accommodated. This is especially true when one group, white gentry liberals, has near-total control over primary communications media and is unwilling to settle for anything less than total dominance of the public dialogue.\n\nThe lesson from David Shor, the Democratic Cassandra, is that such a group can easily overplay its hand and hurt its own cause."

      "text": "Trump's surprise breakthrough with Hispanic voters could spell doom for Democrats\n\nJoe Biden won 65% of the Hispanic vote in the last presidential election. He campaigned on defending the working class and fixing the U.S. immigration system. Two years into his presidency, he has so far failed to do so, and Hispanic voters are increasingly deserting the Democratic Party. With the start of Hispanic Heritage Month, this Washington Examiner series, Taken For Granted , will look at how Biden and Democratic Party policies are failing to connect with the Latino electorate, how Donald Trump and Republicans have benefited, and how it could swing the November midterm elections.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was supposed to be the death knell for the Republican Party and the Hispanic vote, helping to usher in the \"emerging Democratic majority\" forecasters had projected for decades.\n\nInstead, Trump made modest inroads with Hispanics himself and may have presided over the demographic shifting from a reliably Democratic voting bloc to more of a swing vote.\n\nIf those trends hold through this year's midterm elections , it could have lasting implications for the competitiveness of future races.\n\nBIDEN AND DEMOCRATS LOSING GRIP ON HISPANIC VOTERS\n\nIn 2020, Trump won the highest share of the Hispanic vote of any Republican presidential nominee since George W. Bush in 2004 . Like Ronald Reagan in 1984, incumbent GOP presidents seeking a second term have tended to do best with this bloc.\n\nBut Bush was reelected. Reagan won in a 49-state landslide, receiving 59% of the overall national popular vote. Trump improved to 35%, up 14 points from Mitt Romney in 2012, even as he lost the presidency.\n\nTrump won 41% of the Hispanic vote in Texas and 46% in Florida, where he carried Cuban Americans. While the non-Hispanic white vote (62% for Trump in Florida, 66% in Texas) was decisive, this showing helped him keep both big states in the Republican column that November despite the Democrats' best hopes.\n\nThat year, the Hispanic swing to the GOP was more dramatic in some key swing areas. Both South Texas and South Florida, for instance, saw double-digit increases in Republican support, including as much as 20 points in parts of Miami-Dade County and over 10 in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nTROUBLE IN PARADISE FOR THE GOP? A CLOSER LOOK AT THE FLORIDA POLLS\n\n\"One important thing to know about the decline in Hispanic support for Democrats is that it was pretty broad,\" top Democratic data guru David Shor told New York magazine after the election. \"This isn't just about Cubans in South Florida. It happened in New York and California and Arizona and Texas.\"\n\nThings could get even worse for Democrats in November. A Wall Street Journal poll earlier this year found the two parties tied among Hispanics in the generic ballot. The Democratic share of the Hispanic vote fell from more than 60% in 2020 to just 37%, with Republicans also taking 37%, while another 22% were undecided.\n\nFifty-four percent of Hispanics disapproved of the job Joe Biden was doing as president, compared to just 42% who approved. Among Hispanic men, disapproval stood at 61% compared to 38% approval.\n\nIn a hypothetical presidential rematch, Hispanic voters were nearly tied again. Biden took just 44% of the Hispanic vote to Trump's 43%. The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 7.6 percentage points. Hispanic men voted for Trump by 23 points, giving him 56%. A pronounced gender gap, with Hispanic women breaking 55% to 30% for Biden, kept it close. Still, 63% of Hispanic respondents overall said the economy was headed in the wrong direction to 25% who thought it was going in the right one.\n\nTrump was supposed to be incompatible with GOP gains among Hispanics. He was widely viewed as hostile to immigrants in general and Latinos in particular. He spoke of rapists coming across the border from Mexico and pledged to build a wall to stop them, at Mexico's expense. Even his attempts at outreach to this demographic were off-key, such as posing with a taco salad under the caption \"I love Hispanics!\" He defeated two rising Hispanic Republican stars, Sens. Ted Cruz (TX) and Marco Rubio (FL), to win the nomination in 2016.\n\nMany thought Trump would do to the Republican share of the Hispanic vote what Barry Goldwater did to the GOP in the black community. One of only six Republican senators to vote against the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Goldwater was the party's presidential nominee that year. Republicans went from winning 32% of the black vote in 1960 to just 6% four years later and never made it out of the teens again.\n\n\"It did define our party, for at least African American voters, and it still does today. That was a complete shift that occurred that year, and we've never been able to get them back,\" Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said in 2016. \"So, I think it was a defining moment for Republicans with regard to the accomplishments that we had made for African Americans going back to the Civil War.\" When asked if he worried Trump might do similar lasting damage with Hispanics, he replied, \"I do.\"\n\nBut some of what white working-class voters found attractive about Trump, working-class Hispanics did too. Democrats overstated how important immigration was to these voters and how liberal they were on the issue.\n\n\"Hispanic voters oppose illegal immigration very strongly, and they are generally in favor of low legal immigration, too,\" said Jim Robb, referencing the Rasmussen polling in his new book, Political Migrants: Hispanic Voters on the Move .\n\nThese trends were accelerated when Hispanics were repelled by COVID-19 lockdowns, which imperiled their livelihoods. These voters also disliked the \"defund the police\" movement, wanting more law enforcement resources for their communities, and the far Left's embrace of socialism, having in many cases emigrated from socialist countries.\n\nThis opens up the possibility for the GOP to become a multiracial working-class party. \"Roughly the same proportion of African American, Hispanic, and white voters identify as conservative,\" Shor told New York . \"But white voters are polarized on ideology, while nonwhite voters haven't been. Something like 80% of white conservatives vote for Republicans. ... What happened in 2020 is that nonwhite conservatives voted for Republicans at higher rates; they started voting more like white conservatives.\"\n\n\"The shift among Hispanic men was clear, and it seems they were attracted to the strong leadership that President Trump offered,\" Republican pollster Neil Newhouse previously told the Washington Examiner . \"That movement sped up in the '20 cycle as part of the national debate revolved around the Democrats' lurch toward socialistic policies.\"\n\nThere is no guarantee that these trends will continue, of course. In 2020, gains with Hispanics were more than offset by Republican losses with suburban voters , which have persisted amid crime and economic adversity.\n\nBut instead of building a wall between the GOP and Hispanic voters, the Trump era left Republicans with an opportunity to grow."

      "text": "Contrary to Kanye West's Claims, Jewish Organizations Actively Helped Black Artists The Black Hebrew Israelites and the Nation of Islam have spread anti-Semitic attitudes.\n\nC ontroversy has erupted over the behavior of rapper Ye (Kanye West), NBA player Kyrie Irving, and comedian Dave Chappelle. Ye was prepared to go \"death con 3\" against Jews, who he claimed mistreated black artists. Irving tweeted a movie that was infused with anti-Semitic tropes, and Chappelle seemed to suggest during his Saturday Night Live appearance that claims of Jewish control of the entertainment community have merit.\n\nMost responses to Ye's, Irving's, and Chappelle's behavior characterized it as anti-Semitic but avoided discussing why anti-Jewish attitudes have such a presence within the black community. A fall 2020 YouGov survey found that \"about 15% of self-identified white liberals believed in one of the three stereotypes included in the survey, compared to ... 42% of Black liberals. Likewise, about 30% of white conservatives believed one of the stereotypes, compared to more than 50% of Black ... conservatives.\" What explains this phenomenon?\n\nPart of it is caused by the influence of two anti-Semitic groups, the Black Hebrew Israelites and the Nation of Islam, on the black community.\n\nThe anti-Semitic movie that Irving tweeted, Hebrews to Negroes: Wake Up Black America , is based on books associated with the Hebrew Israelite movement. The punishment meted out to Irving by the NBA, suspension for at least five games, was condemned by Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, who criticized LeBron James for his silence. James then publicly condemned the NBA's excessive requirements for Irving's reinstatement.\n\nMost responses also did not address Ye and Chappelle's claims of outsized Jewish influence in the entertainment industry, apart from dismissing them as part of an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory.\n\nThirty years ago, many claimed that Jewish shopkeepers and landlords exploited their black customers and tenants. The Baptist preacher Al Sharpton, for instance, labeled them \"white interlopers.\" By contrast, the noted historian Hasia Diner found that in much of the country in the 20th century, Jews peddlers and shopkeepers were highly valued by black customers. James Baldwin wrote , \"[T]he grocer and the druggist were Jews, for example, and they were very very nice to me, and to us.\" The victimization narrative triumphs, however, so only the negative stories are told and become part of the folklore, further fueling the contemporary animus toward Jews.\n\nOne image that energized Ye's rant was his belief that Jews' control of the recording industry has resulted in the exploitation of black artists. This is a highly charged claim that Chappelle commented on in his SNL appearance . Chappelle pointed to what he suggested was an inconsistency:\n\nIf they're black, then it's a gang.\n\nIf they're Italian, it's a mob.\n\nBut if they're Jewish, it's a coincidence and you should never speak about it.\n\n\"I've been to Hollywood. This was just what I saw. It's a lot of Jews. Like a lot,\" Chappelle continued. \"I can see if you had some kind of issue ... you could maybe adopt the delusion that the Jews run show business. It's not a crazy thing to think. But it's a crazy thing to say out loud.\"\n\nThese statements in particular led to an avalanche of criticism. In the Forward , Sharon Rosen Leib wrote , \"Your monologue ceased being comedic to me when I heard whispers of crazy-town 'Jews own Hollywood' conspiracy theories threaded into its narrative subtext.\"\n\nUnfortunately, claiming that Chappelle's words fed into \"conspiracy theories\" closed off any further inquiry. How extensive are Jewish leadership roles in Hollywood, and, more importantly, are their actions associated with black exploitation?\n\nJust over a decade ago, when then-Anti-Defamation League chair Abe Foxman was asked to comment on the issue, he said , \"That's a very dangerous phrase, 'Jews control Hollywood.'\" While \"it is true that there are a lot of Jews in Hollywood ... Foxman would prefer people say that many executives in the industry 'happen to be Jewish'\" - which is just the \"coincidence\" Chappelle highlighted.\n\nAt the time Foxman made his statement, all eight of the Hollywood studios were run by Jewish men. When Jesse Eisenberg was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in 2011, he described his experience during the awards season. \"I feel like when I was 13 and I had to go to bar mitzvahs every weekend,\" he noted. \"You have to put on a suit every weekend to go meet with a bunch of Jews.\"\n\nThere is a long history that has associated Jewish executives in the recording industry with black exploitation, including a recent New York Times story on Jewish ownership of New Orleans' Preservation Hall. While correctly noting that the Jewish family was sincere in its efforts to save New Orleans jazz offerings, the article gave substantial attention to claims of exploitation, particularly those made by the son of Walter Payton, a longtime Preservation Hall musician. Brett Martin wrote :\n\nPayton's screed ... encapsulated many of the critiques one still hears: that Jaffe can be perceived as a disrespectful and imperious boss. That he puts the interests of himself and the hall above those of the men who play there. That he pays musicians too little while the hall grows rich.\n\nAs I documented in Why the Jews? , most of these claims concerning the jazz industry are inaccurate. In particular, what is often ignored is that declining jazz popularity resulted in the bankruptcy of more than 1,000 jazz record companies in the 1950s. Lamenting this situation, Jerry Wexler, the co-owner of Atlantic Records, reminisced about fallen competitors. He noted that Atlantic prospered only because it transitioned out of jazz into the nascent rock 'n' roll industry. Similarly, Savoy Records, once the leading producer of bebop, only prospered when it shifted to gospel music.\n\nThe promoter George Wein began the Newport Jazz Festival in this declining environment. Like the Jaffes, it meant that in order to sustain profitability, Wein had to pay lead entertainers like Miles Davis less than what they considered \"fair\" pay. \"Despite the years of work devoted to jazz and the jazz musician, I remain a target,\" Wein lamented . \"The Man. The Producer. The 'Enemy.' So it's tantalizingly easy to take shots at me.\"\n\nWhat is often ignored are many of these Jewish executives and managers' positive contributions to labor and civil rights. In the 1940s, Syd Nathan integrated the Cincinnati factory producing his King Records. Any white applicant who refused to work with blacks would not be hired. Leonard Chess bought Etta James, who had a significant drug problem, a house, but she only gained ownership more than a decade later, after she had turned her life around. To protect Louis Armstrong's old age from his undisciplined spending habits, his manager Joe Glaser contracted for putting all of the royalties from his last hit, \"Hello, Dolly,\" into an annuity. And the promoter Norman Granz and Duke Ellington's manager Irving Mills were instrumental in desegregating many performance venues in the 1930s.\n\nRather than obfuscating the outsized influence Jewish executives have in the entertainment industry, Jewish organizations should point out its positive impacts to counter the one-sided victimization narratives.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "AOC's Leftist Sabotage Is Coming Home to Roost U.S. cities burn while social justice warriors fiddle.\n\nR ecent public complaints by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) that New York costs too much for the working class (and should increase taxes on wealthier residents!) are rubbing salt in the wounds of her strident opposition to Amazon locating its headquarters in the city in 2019. A pattern of urban sabotage by social justice Democrats is causing major U.S. cities to experience accelerating economic decline. Despite their efforts to blame white conservatives for this suicidal display, Americans see the true causes.\n\nChicago and Los Angeles have also chased profitable businesses from town while courting illegal denizens, driving up housing costs, and defunding police forces. Gov. Gavin Newsom faces stifling, nosebleed state deficits even as he tours the world touting the far-left policies that seeded California's economic failure as a national recipe for social progress. Efforts to blame these gargantuan failures on Republicans fall on deaf ears. This is an economic activity of the social justice kind: Marxist deconstruction.\n\nAOC has an economics degree from Boston University, but her public attacks against Amazon in 2019 suggest she needs further studies. She posted on X, formerly Twitter :\n\nAmazon is a billion-dollar company. The idea that it will receive hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks at a time when our subway is crumbling and our communities need MORE investment, not less, is extremely concerning to residents here. It's possible to establish economic partnerships [with] real opportunities for working families, instead of a race-to-the-bottom competition.\n\nAmazon's proposal was an \"economic partnership [with] real opportunities for working families.\" AOC pushes rent controls, reckless illegal immigration, higher taxes on residents, and reduced police funding, then cries foul when the resulting economic destruction unfolds. She recently doubled down, claiming that wealthy taxpayers are not fleeing New York City ( they are ) and that higher taxes will benefit the middle class she has destroyed : \"The people who are moving out of the city are not by and large the wealthiest people. They're the working class. They can't afford to live here anymore.\"\n\nAOC has not created economic opportunities for anyone but ideological grifters. New York City is in economic and social freefall. The emergency room patient is being moved to the ICU, and its killer remains at large. Those jobs for working-class people who can \"no longer afford\" New York were generously offered by Amazon, then forcefully jilted by AOC, who claimed that achievement as a victory on X :\n\nToday was the day a group of dedicated, everyday New Yorkers and their neighbors defeated Amazon's corporate greed, its worker exploitation and the power of the richest man in the world.\n\nInstead, hundreds of thousands of undocumented, unemployed migrants have collected in New York City, exploited by Democrats who have no more plans to feed or provide for them than they do for the working-class families being displaced and economically decimated by foolish economic initiatives. This pattern of economic destruction reflects the Marxist ideological policy of de construction - tearing down the economy, schools, families, and everything else that is decent to implement the farcically imagined utopia that will guarantee that \"everyone has everything\" while doing (and owning) nothing.\n\nAmerica's three largest cities are witnessing a massive exodus of businesses, investments, taxpayers, and tax receipts as a direct consequence of reckless policies of overt economic and social sabotage. The instigators of this economic destruction are unrepentant in their shameless disconnect from the working class they claim they are liberating.\n\nHow much worse can it get?\n\nAttorney-farmer John Klar hosts the Small Farm Republic Substack and podcast from his Vermont farm.  His new book is Small Farm Republic: Why Conservatives Must Embrace Local Agriculture, Reject Climate Alarmism, and Lead an Environmental Revival .\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Study: GOP Will Grow with More White Conservatives, Not Less\n\nA new study suggests that politically unaffiliated white Americans who are experiencing a shift to minority status will feel threatened by that shift and subsequently embrace more conservative policies. They will align themselves, therefore, with the Republican Party, providing that party with a more stable base in the midst of racial divisiveness.\n\nThe revealing study , conducted by Maureen Craig and Jennifer Richeson at Northwestern University, was published by the professional journal Psychological Science and noted by Paul Bedard at the Washington Examiner .\n\nThe research challenges the notion that the Republican Party will diminish as its aging white members die and younger whites embrace more liberal policies. It also may challenge the oft-repeated meme of many Republicans that, in order to survive, the party must embrace typically liberal policies such as amnesty, abortion rights, and same-sex marriage.\n\nThe study cites the U.S. Census Bureau's projection that racial minority groups will comprise a majority of the country's population in 2042, thereby creating a \"majority-minority\" nation. In four experiments, the researchers explored how the prominence of racial demographic changes affects white Americans' political party inclinations and expressed ideology.\n\nResearchers asked groups of whites to read differing reports about the anticipated racial shift. Results showed that the shift to the right was highest among those who only read reports indicating that the demographic change could threaten their status. Whites who read reports stating that they would remain ahead in terms of income and other factors felt less threatened.\n\nOverall, however, whites united and supported conservative policies as a group.\n\n\"These results offer compelling evidence that making a majority-minority racial shift salient can lead whites to perceive that their racial group's status is threatened and, in turn, to express greater political conservatism,\" wrote the authors.\n\n\"Although this so-called majority-minority shift has been cited as a source of impending trouble for the Republican Party, there is reason to believe that it may lead to greater endorsement of conservative political ideology, at least among white Americans,\" they added.\n\n\"Moreover, the results implicate group-status threat as the mechanism underlying these effects,\" wrote the researchers. \"Taken together, this work suggests that the increasing diversity of the nation may engender a widening partisan divide.\"\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Nolte: Poll Shows Far Left Much More Approving of Political Violence Since 2016\n\nPolling of \"white liberals\" compared to \"white conservatives\" shows increased approval of political violence among white liberals since 2016 and decreased tolerance among white conservatives.\n\nThe poll asked, \"How much do you feel it is justified for people to use violence to pursue their political goals?\"\n\nHere is the breakdown of those who said violence is \"not at all\" justified:\n\nIn 2016, 87 percent of white liberals said violence is \"not at all\" justified. In 2020, that number dropped five points to 82 percent.\n\nIn 2016, 88 percent of white conservatives said \"not at all.\" In 2020, that number jumped seven points to 95 percent.\n\nThe poll was conducted by the American National Elections Studies Time Series (2016, 2020) and shows a very disturbing increase among liberals who justify political violence (aka terrorism) and a large decrease among white conservatives.\n\nNone of this is surprising to those of us who lived in the real world between 2016 and 2020. We sat through four years of the Democrat party and corporate media encouraging, justifying, and at times, openly calling for violence.\n\nOf course, during that time, the very same Democrat party and corporate media tried to gaslight us into believing white conservatives were the real threat. This data (and our own eyes) again proves that a lie.\n\nThe news in this poll only gets worse...\n\nAmong those who identify as \" very liberal \" and white, the percentage who believe political violence is \"not at all\" justified plummeted 20 points, from 87 percent in 2016 to just 67 percent today.\n\nAmong \" very conservative \" whites, that number increased from 93.3 percent to 95.8 percent.\n\nSo over those four years, the percentage of very liberal whites who believe political violence is never okay plummeted to 67 percent, while the percentage of very conservatives whites who say the same increased to 96 percent.\n\nBasically, as things stand now, you have a full third of \"very liberal\" whites who are okay with political violence, while only four percent of \"very conservative\" whites say the same.\n\nAgain, our eyes and ears ensured this poll comes as no surprise. After all, it is Democrat-run cities across the country that are on fire at the hands of the left-wing terrorists in Antifa and Black Lives Matter, all while the Democrat party and the establishment media cheer them on.\n\nIn this same poll, among Democrats in general, regardless of skin color, only 78 percent oppose political violence, a drop from 81 percent in 2016.\n\nAmong Republicans of all races, 90 percent say violence is never justified, a jump from 87 percent in 2016.\n\nPer this poll (and our own eyes), over the last four years, Democrats have become much more comfortable and approving of political violence (aka terrorism) while Republicans have become less approving.\n\nNevertheless, the very same Democrats in the political and media worlds who are more approving of violence are also lying by saying it is Republicans who are becoming more violent.\n\nThe fact is this: the left is becoming more violent while attempting to justify their violence with lies about how conservatives are becoming more violent.\n\nBottom line: The threat from the left is very, Very, VERY real.\n\nYou need to be prepared to defend yourself.\n\nThis is not a drill.\n\nIt is only going to get worse.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC .

      "text": "15 Liberals Who Compared Conservatives to Nazis But Weren't Canceled for It\n\nActress Gina Carano was fired from the cast of the popular Disney Plus- Star Wars spinoff series The Mandalorian on Wednesday after sharing a social media post that likened people in society today to Nazi supporters during the Holocaust.\n\nCarano's social media post in question went as follows:\n\nJews were beaten in the streets, not by Nazi soldiers but by their neighbors... even by children.\n\n\"Because history is edited, most people today don't realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews. How is that any different from hating someone for their political views?\"\n\nCritics say that Carano's social media post downplays the experience of Jews during the Holocaust. Others have also called the way the actress was treated a stark double standard, given that a slew of prominent liberals - from Democratic lawmakers, to mainstream media pundits, to Hollywood figures - have been likening their political adversaries to Nazis for years.\n\nFor instance, as Breitbart's David Ng notes , \"[I]n what appears to be a corporate double standard, her co-star Pedro Pascal has also conflated current politics with Nazi Germany and remains employed by the studio. The difference is that while Carano compared current Democratic policies to the Nazis, Pascal likened the Trump administration to Germany's Third Reich.\"\n\nHere are 15 liberals who have compared former President Donald Trump, his supporters, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and conservatives to Nazis - but were never canceled as a result.\n\n1. President Joe Biden\n\nLast year, Biden compared then-President Trump to \"a German Nazi propagandist,\" according to a report by Politico .\n\n\"Trump is 'sort of like Goebbels,' Biden said, invoking the name of Joseph Goebbels, the mastermind of Nazi Germany's propaganda machine. 'You say the lie long enough, keep repeating it, repeating it, repeating it, it becomes common knowledge' among voters,\" the report said.\n\n2. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY)\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has attacked the Trump administration's immigration policies by claiming that the former president was running actual \"concentration camps\" on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nOcasio-Cortez later doubled down on her claims, declaring that she would never apologize for comparing detention facilities at the U.S. border with \"concentration camps\" in Nazi-occupied Europe.\n\n3. Actor Robert De Niro\n\nLast November, De Niro accused President Trump of using the same \"playbook\" as Nazi German-era dictator Adolf Hitler's in his pitch to voters to make America great again.\n\n\"It's the same playbook as Mussolini, as Hitler, as a dictator, wannabe dictators,\" said De Niro. \"It's what they're going to do for the people, make Germany great again, make Italy great again, make America great again.\"\n\nWatch below:\n\n4. Donny Deutsch\n\nFormer MSNBC host Donny Deutsch has compared ICE to Nazis, stating that they \"literally go to the streets\" and \"storm and show up and grab families and children.\" Deutsch went on to say that illegal aliens in the U.S. are \"running just like the Jews ran from the Nazis.\"\n\nIn 2018, the MSNBC host also suggested that Trump supporters are no different than Nazi supporters. \"If you vote for Trump, then you, the voter, you, not Donald Trump, are standing at the border, like Nazis,\" said Deutsch, adding that \"if you vote, you can no longer separate yourself\" from the \"evilness of Donald Trump.\"\n\n5. Actress  Rosanna Arquette\n\nLast month, the actress likened Trump to Hitler, proclaiming that he \"did everything a dictator does.\"\n\n\"Like Adolph Hitler, Trump is a fascist dictator he did everything a dictator does by the book,\" tweeted Arquette. \"Any person in office who stands by Trumps Nazi tactics should never hold office again this is a movement filled with violent and dangerous people.\"\n\nIn November, the actress smeared tens of million of Americans, claiming that the GOP are \"Nazi gestapo\" that \"blindly follow their insane unhinged leader and commit crimes against humanity.\"\n\n6. Actress Jane Fonda\n\nThe actress Jane Fonda has compared Trump's passionate defense against false reportage by the establishment media to Hitler's attacks on the German press.\n\n\"If you have read anything about the rise of the Third Reich and Adolf Hitler you will see the parallels,\" said Fonda in 2018. \"Attacking the media is the first step and move toward fascism.\"\n\n7. HBO host Bill Maher\n\nIn 2016, Maher compared President Trump to Adolf Hitler by reciting a mock translation of one of Hitler's speeches, using language quintessential of the way Trump sounded during his speeches on the campaign trail at the time.\n\n\"We're going to make Germany great again, that I can tell you, believe me,\" said Maher, reading the mock subtitles below a video of a Hitler speech. \"Germany doesn't win anymore. England, France, America, they're laughing at us. The Treaty of Versailles? A terrible deal! And look, I love the Jews, nobody loves the Jews more than me, but folks, either we have a Fatherland or we don't. So we're going to have to build a camp, and I will make the Jews pay for it,\" continued Maher. \"When I'm done with them, they'll be saying 'Merry Christmas,' that I can tell you.\"\n\nWatch below:\n\n8. Singer and NBC's The Voice star John Legend\n\nAfter Trump won the 2016 election, Legend blasted the then-president-elect, stating that his \"Hitler-like\" rhetoric could turn the United States into Nazi Germany.\n\n\"I feel like it's dangerous for us to be complacent,\" the singer said. \"It's dangerous for us to think that it couldn't happen to us like it happened to Germany in the '30s and '40s.\"\n\n9. CNN anchor Don Lemon\n\nIn 2019, CNN anchor Don Lemon suggested that Trump shouldn't have a platform by comparing the former president to Hitler.\n\n\"Think about Hitler,\" said Lemon. \"Would you say that that person is allowed - let's put it this way, if you could look back in history, would you say, 'Well, I'm so glad that that person was allowed a platform so that they could spread their hate and propaganda and lies,' or would you say, 'It probably wasn't the right thing to do to spread that' because you knew in the moment that that was a bad person and they were doing bad things. Not only were they hurting people, they were killing people.\"\n\nLemon's fellow CNN anchor Chris Cuomo pushed back on his remarks, stating, \"comparing anything to an extreme, like a Hitler, it weakens the argument, because you are now taking a guy who says things you don't like and comparing him to a genocidal maniac.\"\n\nWhile the two disagreed on the issue, Lemon was never \"canceled\" for making the Nazi comparison.\n\nWatch below\n\n10. MSNBC host Joy Reid\n\nThat same year, MSNBC host Joy Reid pointed out that media coverage of Hitler was \"benign\" in the 1930s, implying that the media was making the same mistake with Trump, by not pushing back harder.\n\n\"I have this set of old New York Times front covers - to show how benign the coverage was, even in the 1930s, as the world was about to burn down in World War II,\" said Reid. \"And the just sort of benign things, you know, it's like a tick of wanting to see world leaders - in that case of Germany - they just want to see them as normal, and I don't know where that comes from.\"\n\n\"And I think it wouldn't be so if those leaders were not white men, I have to say,\" added Reid. \"White conservatives - there is a sense that conservatism is normal, and that white conservative men are the norm.\"\n\n11. Actor-comedian Louis C.K.\n\nIn 2016, Louis C.K. wrote a lengthy email to his fans, begging conservative voters not to be like \"Germany in the '30s\" by voting for \"Hitler\" Donald Trump.\n\n\"Please stop it with voting for Trump,\" wrote C.K. \"It was funny for a little while. But the guy is Hitler. And by that I mean that we are being Germany in the '30s. Do you think they saw the sh-t coming? Hitler was just some hilarious and refreshing dude with a weird comb over who would say anything at all.\"\n\n12. Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC)\n\nAfter the 2020 presidential election, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-SC) compared Trump's \"refusal to concede\" to \"what Hitler did in Germany\" in an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo.\n\n\"I'm beginning to see what happened in Germany back in the 1930s,\" said Clyburn. \"I never thought that could happen in this country. How do you elect a person president, then all of a sudden you're going to give him the authority to be dictator? That's what Hitler did in Germany.\"\n\nWatch below:\n\n13. Former Congressman Beto O'Rourke\n\nIn 2019, then-Democrat presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke compared the Trump administration to Nazi Germany in an interview with the Washington Post .\n\n\"I think sooner rather than later, a majority of Americans - including Republicans - are going to see Trump for who he is, and this administration for what it's done,\" said O'Rourke. \"Outside of the Third Reich, give me another example of a Western leader who has called one people of one faith inherently defective or dangerous or disqualified from being successful in that country.\"\n\n14. Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA)\n\nThat same year, Rep. Hank Johnson (D-GA) likened the political moment that brought Trump to power to the rise of Hitler. \"Americans elected an authoritarian, racist, anti-immigrant strongman to the nation's highest office,\" said Johnson, adding that Hitler \"rode a wave of nationalism and anti-Semitism to power.\"\n\n\"Replace anti-Semitism with 'all Latinos crossing our borders are rapists, drug dealers and murderers.' Does that sound familiar?\" Johnson added.\n\n15. Actor John Cusack\n\nLast year, actor John Cusack compared President Trump to Hitler in an interview, stating, \"Hitler sort of stole from the avant-garde left - he hated the message of the avant-garde left because it was anti-war, but he understood that politics was the new art and that art and politics were going to be infused. You can see Trump sort of doing the same thing.\"\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Facebook and Twitter at @ARmastrangelo , and on Instagram .\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "CNN Goes Full Racist: 'Nothing More Frightening' than Angry White Men\n\nCNN followed up the Kyle Rittenhouse \"not guilty\" verdict by leading with an op-ed from John Blake proclaiming there is \"nothing more frightening in America today than an angry white man.\"\n\nPutting it as the lead on the front page with a photo of the acquitted Rittenhouse, the op-ed essentially lumped the 18-year-old in with men like Jacob Chansley, a.k.a the \"QAnon shaman,\" and the white supremacists who participated in the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville.\n\n(CNN.com/screenshot)\n\nThough Blake admitted the \"vast majority of White men are no menace to society,\" citing the numerous left-wing men who \"wallowed tear gas and braved rubber bullets while marching with demonstrators during last year's protests over the murder of George Floyd,\" Blake asserted that the time has come to put a certain character trait on trial: \"a vision of White masculinity that allows some White men to feel as if they ' can rule and brutalize without consequence. '\"\n\n\"This angry White man has been a major character throughout US history,\" Blake lamented. \"He gave the country slavery, the slaughter of Native Americans, and Jim Crow laws. His anger also helped fuel the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol.\"\n\n\"It's this angry White man - not the Black or brown man you see approaching on the street at night - who poses the most dangerous threat to democracy in America,\" he continued.\n\nLest people accuse him of racism, Blake admitted his statement condemning white men so broadly was a \"sweeping claim\" while maintaining that the rise of the angry white man, fueled in part by former President Trump, has led to a spike in political violence. His chief example: Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ) sharing an anime cartoon in which he kills socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) with a sword. Though Blake acknowledged the 2017 attack in which a Bernie Sanders supporter attempted to assassinate Republican members of Congress, he believes that too many white conservatives fantasize about killing their opponents:\n\nTalking about assaulting and killing political enemies has become so normal - and seemingly acceptable - in conservative circles today that a White man felt comfortable enough to ask a right-wing activist at a public forum in Idaho last month:\n\n\"When do we get to use the guns? ... How many elections are they going to steal before we kill these people?\"\n\nAdd to this toxic political atmosphere another element: Laws that not only protect White vigilante violence but, in some cases, seem to embolden vigilantes.\n\n\"That period, known as Reconstruction, was destroyed primarily by the violence of White men who used terrorist and vigilante groups like the KKK to assassinate elected officials, prevent Blacks from voting and overthrow state government,\" Blake said.\n\n\"The January 6 insurrection wasn't unprecedented. In many ways, it was a sequel,\" he added, citing an 1898 case in Wilmington, North Carolina, where white supremacists killed members of the multi-racial local government.\n\nBlake did not so much as even acknowledge how the wave of angry far-left activists (black and white) burned their way across the United States in 2020, destroying businesses, homes, and neighborhoods.\n\nBlake concluded his piece with a warning that Rittenhouse and other cases point to a frightening future.\n\n\"This is what that future looks like: More angry White men emboldened by 'stand your ground' and citizen's arrest laws, inspired by a conservative interpretation of the Second Amendment. And more dead Americans,\" he concluded.\n\nThe \"not guilty\" verdict in the Rittenhouse trial has led to scores of far-left media figures lamenting that white supremacy will go unchecked. Speaking on MSNBC, NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson even went as far as to say that the Rittenhouse acquittal was worse than the acquittal for those who killed Emmett Till.\n\n\"This was worse than the Emmett Till trial. This was worse [than] so many trials where we know, for a fact, individuals committed murder and yet they were not brought to justice,\" Johnson said. \"It is unfortunate, but this is America.\"\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "Transgenderism Critics are Like White Supremacists, Says Leftist Scottish MP\n\nFar-left Scottish Nationalist Party MP Mhairi Black has compared people who are critical of the transgender movement to white supremacists, sparking outrage from feminist groups.\n\nSpeaking at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, deputy Westminster leader of the SNP, Mhairi Black declared that \"bad actors\" and \"50-year-old Karens\" are responsible for the contentious debate surrounding transgenderism and that only people who champion the LGBT ideology are \"decent\".\n\nBlack went on to say that people who make \"intellectual\" against the trans encroachment on women's protections and rights were similar to those who in previous generations claimed some races were inferior to white people, the Scottish Daily Express reported .\n\n\"Once upon a time, you had intellectuals who made these big prolific statements about how race was a key factor. [They argued] 'I think you'll find statistics show that if you have more BAME [black, Asian and minority ethnic] people; crime goes up' or whatever it is.\n\n\"We now rightly look back on that and go, 'You were a racist. You might be an intellectual, but what you were saying was racist.' If you're not educating yourself on things, then you can't complain when people from a minority say, 'You're not treating us right', and that's exactly what's happening with the trans community right now.\"\n\nThe leftist MP went on to allege that there are dark forces radicalising people online, whom she claims are funded in some way by \"fundamental Christian groups in America, Baptist groups, anti-abortion organisations.\"\n\nThe comments were criticised by the campaign group For Women Scotland, which characterised her statements as a \"damning indictment of her intellectual capacity and her fitness to act as a legislator\".\n\n\"Her inability to grasp why highly vulnerable women in prison, fleeing domestic violence, or being cared for in hospital might not want to share intimate spaces with someone of the male sex suggests that it is long past time she got out of her highly cosseted, gilded bubble,\" the group continued.\n\n\"Women who disagree with her should not be forced to be silent like some latter-day scold, nor are they the racist or religious fundamentalist bogeywomen.\"\n\nScotland has increasingly become an epicentre for the political fight over transgenderism, with the far-left government of former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon passing legislation earlier this year to allow anyone over the age of 16 years old to \"self-identify\" with the gender of their choosing.\n\nThe law was ultimately blocked by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government in Westminster, however, Sturgeon's replacement as first minister of Scotland, Humza Yousaf has expressed a desire to back a legal challenge to allow the measure to go forward.\n\nThe policy came under international scrutiny earlier this year after a biologically male rapist was placed in a female prison after identifying as transgender. Sturgeon's failure in being able to say whether she believed the rapist was a woman or not was seen as a contributing factor in her political downfall.\n\nYousaf - infamous for maligning how many white people are in the Scottish government - seems intent on continuing the radical stance of Sturgeon on the issue of social justice on issues such as race and gender.\n\nSpeaking at the Fringe Festival, Yousaf complained about how during his career he has been \"told by mainly middle-aged white Conservatives, both in politics and frankly, some in the media, that I'm not smart, I'm out of my depth, essentially saying you don't belong here in the political realm.\"\n\n\"And, yeah, I hope that any other person, whether it's your colour, whether it's your gender, or whether it's your background if you get told actually you don't belong here, you should kind of look at me and say, F*** you,\" the First Minister said per The Herald .\n\nDespite later admitting that his message was \"not first ministerial language\", he claimed it was appropriate given the context.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

In response to the recent campaign to end Chinese virus shutdowns, Cooper posted, \"Fuck each and every Trump supporter.\"\n\nAccording to a report by Campus Reform, Rutgers University Associate Professor of Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Brittney Cooper came under fire this week after taking aim at Trump supporters in a lengthy Twitter thread.\n\n\"I am saying some obvious things this morning because as a country we are too good at skipping over the audience and we might as well say this to people as often as we can. Fuck each and every Trump supporter. You all absolutely did this. You are to blame,\" Cooper wrote in one tweet.\n\nCooper wrote that it is \"utterly absurd\" to reopen the country at this stage of the ongoing pandemic. According to Cooper, white conservatives want to open the nation because it will \"disproportionately\" affect black Americans.\n\n\"I feel like most Black people are clear that this utterly absurd to push [sic] to re-open the country is all about a gross necropolitical calculation that it is Black people who are dying disproportionately from COVID. Not only do white conservatives not care about Black life, but my most cynical negative read of the white supremacists among them is that they welcome this massive winnowing of Black folks in order to slow demographic shifts and shore up political power.\"\n\nProfessor Cooper has a history of bizarre remarks. In October 2019, Cooper argued during an interview on Oprah's television network that the policies of the Trump administration have led to high levels of obesity for Black women.\n\n\"I hate when people talk about Black women being obese. I hate it because it becomes a way to blame us for a set of conditions that we didn't create,\" Cooper said. \"We are living in the Trump era. And look, those policies kill our people.

      "text": "M. Stanton Evans, Carried Off to a Gospel Beat\n\nConservative founding father M. Stanton Evans was well known for his wit-he said he never liked anything about Nixon until Watergate. His funeral may have been his last witticism: a Protestant service, led by a Catholic priest, with a black Methodist choir rocking the otherwise staid Catholic Church.\n\nBoth the priest and the choir were mentioned in Evans's will because he wanted them both for his funeral.\n\nEvans had met Father Vince Rigdon years ago as a reporter covering the disturbances at Columbia University, and Rigdon was an undergraduate wanting to fight back against the radicalism of the day. They became lifelong friends.\n\nAs for the choir-Evans used to hear them through the window as he passed a black Methodist Church near his home.\n\nM. Stanton Evans was eulogized Thursday afternoon in the presence of a who's who of the old political right: the now gray, balding, and sometimes caned generation that knew Bill Buckley and Ronald Reagan as peers, along with a raft of younger, though not young, conservatives.\n\nRichard Viguerie, Ed Meese, David Keene, Don Lambro ( Washington Times ), Tom Winter (Human Events), Al Regnery Jr., Morton Blackwell (Leadership Institute), Tom Pauken (former Reagan official), Terry Scanlon (Capital Research Center), Terry Jeffrey (CNS), Brent Bozell, Grover Norquist, Robert Royal, Kate O'Beirne, and many more came to see Evans off, a man described repeatedly as a Christian believer, just not a very good one.\n\nFather Vince Rigdon, himself no slouch in this crowd, what with his name on the important Rigdon v. Perry Supreme Court decision, told a story in his sermon that summed up Evans's dedication to teaching younger generations of conservatives.\n\nBack in 1999, some students at St. Bonaventure College invited Evans to give a speech, one of thousands Evans gave in his life. As usual, he continued his lessons afterwards over beers and-like with Rigdon-went on to maintain lifelong contact with a student named Mario Calabrese who later became a Dominican priest.\n\nIn his final days, Calabrese baptized Evans who didn't know if he'd ever received that sacrament before. Calabrese also administered the Last Rights of the Catholic Church, though Evans was not a Catholic.\n\n\"And that,\" said Rigdon pointing dramatically to a stout young Dominican, \"is Father Mario Calabrese sitting right there.\"\n\nAnyone who came of conservative age during the last half century will know the name of M. Stanton Evans. He taught more than a few generations of conservatives what it means to be a conservative and what it means to America for them to be conservative. He drafted one of the founding documents of the modern conservative movement, the so-called Sharon Statement that founded Young Americans for Freedom.\n\nAfter graduating from Yale, he helped edit The Freeman , one of the first libertarian journals in America. He became head editorial writer of the Indianapolis News and, the following year, took over the editorship, becoming, at 26, the youngest editor of a metropolitan daily in the country.\n\nHe served as associate editor of National Review for thirteen years, and then managing editor of Human Events, contributing to it until the end of his life. He was also chairman of the American Conservative Union, and, for twenty-five years, he ran the National Journalism Center that taught Ann Coulter how to write.\n\nA few hundred other great Americans accompanied M. Stan Evans on his final journey from a Catholic Church in Leesburg, Virginia, on Thursday afternoon, and all the while the black choir did their best to get the room up and clapping though this was not to be. A church full of ancient white conservatives urged on by a gospel beat: M. Stanton Evans's last bon mot .\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "STEPHEN MOORE: Here's How Trump Could Get America Back In Touch With Its Patriotic Roots\n\nHard to believe it was just four years ago that President Joe Biden was elected with a promise to unite the country. After the misery of COVID-19 deaths and lockdowns and the riots in the streets of major cities, Americans wanted to be united by a unifying national purpose.\n\nAlas, it never happened. Instead, Biden and his leftist allies were drunk with power and swerved the Democratic Party even further to the left. This alienated half the country, with a ruinous and unpopular progressive agenda on every issue, from running up massive debts to rampant inflation to transgenderism to electric vehicle mandates.\n\nThe country was only further torn asunder. (RELATED: BOB EHRLICH: Let Them Eat Cake)\n\nCan President-elect Donald Trump learn from these blunders and be the president who unifies the country by embracing traditional American ideals? The Make America Great Again agenda has some rough edges for sure, but if presented right, led by a message of hope, not malice, Trump can deliver an idealistic policy that the vast majority of Americans can embrace.\n\nThe way to do this is for Trump, as we approach our 250th birthday, to strike up the theme of a New American Patriotism. This should be a red-white-and-blue message centered around a renewed appreciation and celebration of American virtue and greatness.\n\nWhat better way to pull the country together? It should be an extension of the Reagan message of America being a \" shining city on a hill \" and a \" beacon of freedom \" for the rest of the world.\n\nWhich we are.\n\nFor at least a generation and maybe two, our schools and our universities have denigrated America's moral standing. We have been lectured that we should be ashamed of our nation's past, not proud of our founding and our achievements of spreading freedom and free enterprise across the planet.\n\nThe hard left magnifies America's failures - particularly slavery and segregation - not the magnitude of our successes and our virtue. Foreigners who visit the United States often can't believe the extent to which our media, entertainment industry and intellectual class obsess over our moral failings.\n\nBiden was particularly guilty of this, when he falsely accused the United States of being a systemically racist country.\n\nWrong, Joe.\n\nA strong case can be made that America is today the world's greatest and perhaps only multiracial success story. The melting pot isn't just a history-book fantasy. It is real. The rapid increase in interracial and intercultural marriages is making racial distinctions almost obsolete. The rapid rise in incomes of Asians, Hispanics and, to a lesser extent, Blacks should be celebrated.\n\nRecent polling suggests that our citizens do appreciate American greatness. The only group that doesn't is the ideologically isolated cultural and \"highly educated\" elite. The vast majority of Americans of every race and income category believe America is \"the greatest country on Earth.\" But many white liberal elites reject this notion.\n\nAnother example: White conservatives and Hispanics soundly reject the idea that America is systemically racist. According to Pew Research Center , \"about six-in-ten Black adults say racism\" is a problem in America today. But it is telling that many white liberals also believe this.\n\nIs there still racism in America? Of course, yes. But it is not \"systemic,\" and the nation is becoming less racially polarized with every passing year.\n\nAmerica's inventiveness, our innovation and our technological prowess, which propelled the world into the modern age and helped reduce poverty rates by 90%, are somehow sinister. Damn those fiends Thomas Edison and Henry Ford.\n\nFortunately, these are views of a class of modern-day intellectuals who never produced anything but instead sow the seeds of miscontent and division. They certainly have the right to hold these blame-America-first ideals, but we don't have to allow them in our classrooms to pollute the minds of our kids.\n\nThis is an extension of the Reagan metaphor of America as a \"shining city on a hill\" and a \"beacon of freedom\" for all the world. It's truer today than ever before, and Trumpnomics will make it all the more true.\n\nStephen Moore is a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation.

      "text": "HERSCHEL WALKER: MLK's Dream Is Dying, But Together We Can Save It\n\n(Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images)\n\nIn 1963, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. told us about his dream that one day, his children would live in a nation where they would not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. Ever since that powerful speech, Democrats have portrayed themselves as the keepers of that dream. But now, they have turned their backs on it.\n\nYes, they pay lip service to it with their DEI poison, but attempts to divide this country along racial lines are not at all what Dr. King had in mind. DEI stands for diversity, equity, and inclusion, but all it achieves is division, evil, and injustice. It will kill the dream.\n\nThe Democrats have sold their souls for political power at the expense of the people they claim to care about. And too many Republicans have just plain sold out and refuse to stand up to this nonsense.\n\nIs this nation perfect? No, but we try to be. Look how far we have come. Blacks have reached the highest levels of government, business, medicine, law, sports, and entertainment. As Dr. King predicted, the descendants of former slaves and former slave owners have been sitting down together at the table of brotherhood for decades. We are so close to achieving Dr. King's dream throughout all segments of society. Yet every time we go to kick the football to put points on the board, the Democrats pull it away.\n\nThey pull it away by telling black kids to look at their white classmates as oppressors. You can't get to equality that way. Kids don't see race. They see friends. Why would anyone want to destroy that innocence?\n\nYou can't get to equality by trapping poor kids in failing schools. Education is the great equalizer, but only if you put the interests of the children ahead of the teachers' unions.\n\nYou can never get to equality by pushing more people into poverty with sky-high inflation and out-of-control spending . The middle class is shrinking . Everyone is struggling with soaring prices for food , gas , and housing . Everyone, that is, except the elites.\n\nYou won't get to equality by throwing money at programs without demanding accountability for results. California spent $24 billion over the last five years on programs for the homeless but has no idea where a lot of the money went or whether its programs are working. No one can account for the spending, and no one is taking responsibility for the outcomes. Despite the massive spending, homelessness has increased to crisis levels .\n\nIt's impossible to get to equality by keeping people desperate and dependent on the government. You can't get to equality by making communities unsafe and allowing deadly drugs to flow like water into our cities and towns. You will not get to equality by forcing carpenters and plumbers to pay off the loans of wealthy lawyers.\n\nAnd you will never get to equality by mocking people of faith. Blacks have a long tradition of turning to their churches for strength in difficult times. When Democrats attack Christians and their beliefs and try to remove God from all aspects of life, that doesn't just affect white conservatives, which is bad enough. It harms the African American community in a profound way.\n\nThe Republican party is the party of Lincoln - the party of freedom. It's the party of Reagan - lifting all boats with economic prosperity and strength. Republican policies provide the best path for achieving Dr. King's dream: school choice, parental rights, border security, law and order, a strong military, energy independence, fiscal discipline. Unfortunately, Republican lawmakers are wasting time fighting with each other instead of moving the ball as a team.\n\nThe American people are paying attention. They have every right to ask their elected representatives questions like, \"Are you making our lives better?\" \"Are you keeping us safe?\" \"Are you keeping the country strong?\" \"Are you spending taxpayer money wisely?\" \"Are you lifting people out of poverty?\" \"Are you teaching kids how to think instead of what to think?\" \"Are you preparing them for success in life?\"\n\nThe Democrats can't answer \"yes\" to a single one of these questions. It's clear we can't count on them to advance the ball for us. It's time to put them on the bench and let Republicans run it into the end zone. Otherwise, we run the risk of losing the dream forever.\n\nHerschel Walker is a former Georgia Senate candidate and NFL player.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller.\n\nTRENDING\n\n©2025 The Daily Caller, Inc.\n\nThe Daily Caller | 1775 Eye Street NW | Suite 1150-290 | Washington, DC 20006\n\nSubscription Type\n\nUnlimited digital access to The Daily Caller\n\nPremium Article: Subscribe for $1 to read the rest.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nAlready have an account?

      "text": "The Mayor Of Baltimore Attacks White People As The City Deals With Bridge Collapse\n\nI'm sure I have canceled MSNBC talking head Joy Reid before. I can't remember specifically at this moment because all of the ignoramuses discussed during my Daily Cancellation segment blend together in my mind, forming one big, loud, ball of stupid. I can only assume that Joy has been featured multiple times because she is so aggressively, obnoxiously terrible in every way a person can be terrible.\n\nThere are evil people who think they're virtuous and there are dumb people who think they're smart: Joy Reid falls into both categories. She even looks the part, with the bleach blond, short cropped hair and permanent scowl she looks like the kind of middle aged woman who yells at the pizza delivery guy because the pizza doesn't have pepperoni on it, even though it's not the delivery guy's fault, and even though she didn't order pepperoni. The point is, I'm not especially a fan of Joy Reid. But today we have to pay her some special attention once again, unfortunately. In fact, we are covering this today because the Joy Reid segment in question takes a certain turn that makes it even more relevant.\n\nSo, Joy took to her low-rated cable news show last night to call out the alleged racist conservatives who have been engaging in alleged racist conspiracy theories surrounding the Baltimore bridge collapse. We talked about the conspiracy theory angle yesterday, but Joy takes this in a different direction. It would probably be easiest just to play the segment and walk through all the many ways that she gets things wrong. Watch:\n\nActually, Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) didn't suggest it was an intentional attack. And even if she did, that's not a conspiracy theory. Intentional attacks on infrastructure are a well known threat. There's nothing outlandish about suggesting that it may have happened. But she's not even suggesting. That tweet that Joy briefly flashes on the screen says: \"There should be a serious investigation into the horrifying tragedy of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Maryland. Is this an intentional attack or an accident? Praying for the victims, survivors and families.\"\n\nWhich part of that tweet is conspiratorial or outlandish? In fact, I can't imagine a more measured and normal way to respond in a situation like this. Is Joy Reid suggesting that it's inappropriate to even wonder whether the incident was intentional? That's odd, because the people investigating the crash also wondered about that. So far they're saying they don't think it was, but that's obviously an angle they pursued immediately.\n\nAre they conspiracy theorists too? Joy doesn't say. Let's continue:\n\nA few points here. Number one, it is fashionable to be openly racist in this country, just not against black people. But Joy Reid herself proves, and what comes next in this segment will again demonstrate, that racism against white people is indeed very fashionable.\n\nSecond, she is showing us tweets to prove whatever point she's trying to make. As we've seen, the first tweet she displayed from Marjorie Taylor Green totally contradicted her point. She wants to demonstrate that conservatives are being wildly conspiratorial about this. So she showed us a tweet where Marjorie Taylor Green was completely measured and utterly reasonable. Next we see a tweet from some congressional candidate I've never heard of. And then we see one from an anonymous account on X called \"I am yes you are no\" with a cartoon profile photo. You know, that guy. That world famous conservative thinker named \"I am yes you are no.\"\n\nNow, obviously, Joy is correct that it doesn't require DEI to get a black man elected mayor in Baltimore. Every Baltimore mayor for the past 30 years, except one, has been black. They've also all been terrible, as the city has plunged into decades of crime, violence, and rampant drug use, but that's a topic for another day. But she is right that the joking nickname given to this guy by an anonymous cartoon Twitter account is not technically accurate.\n\nAs to the suggestion that DEI might have something to do with the bridge collapse itself, that may not be accurate. We still don't know. We may never know for sure. There are many factors that played into this incident - factors that are still being investigated - and at this point it's just not possible to say for sure whether or not DEI policies played a part. But if people immediately speculate about the role of DEI in incidents like this, it's not because those people are so terrible. It's because DEI is so terrible. The fact remains that DEI policies have deliberately and systematically lowered standards across the board in virtually every industry, all in the name of making every industry less white. That is a fact. It has happened. It is happening. Joy Reid supports and promotes these policies. And now we are witnessing the collapse of competence across the country because of it.\n\nThat doesn't mean that every catastrophe is linked to this campaign of destruction in the name of diversity. But it does mean that it's perfectly reasonable to wonder whether any particular catastrophe is linked to it. And it also means that inevitably some people will draw that connection even before it has been factually established. That's what happens when you come up with a racist policy that intentionally makes everything worse in every conceivable way. The problem here is the policy. Not the random Twitter accounts that Joy Reid is crying about.\n\nBut it wasn't enough to have Joy Reid cry about them on her own. She also brought the mayor of Baltimore on the air to respond. You would think that the man has a crisis to attend to and would be too busy to spend time doing an interview to respond to a joking tweet from an anonymous Twitter account, but you would be wrong. Watch:\n\nI'm going to skip right past the mayor's statement that it requires courage to say the n-word. Something tells me that if any white person did say it in his presence, he would have a lot of things to say in response, and praising them for their courage would not be one of the things. The bigger headline here is this part. He said: \"Me being in this position means that their way of thinking, their way of life of being comfortable while everyone else suffers is at risk. And they should be afraid because that's my purpose in life.\"\n\nJust to recap the situation here. The mayor of Baltimore, in the midst of a major disaster, has taken the time to go on a political talk show to play the victim because someone tweeted something mean about him. And then, in the middle of this little pageant, he proceeded to issue a threat, and even declare that his \"purpose\" is to put \"at risk\" the livelihood of these people he's threatening. You might hope that his primary purpose right now is to figure out what to do about the fact that a bridge that carried 30 thousand commuters a day is now lying at the bottom of the Patapsco River. But apparently not.\n\nAnd who is the \"they\" that he's talking about here? He says that \"their way of life is at risk.\" And \"they should be afraid.\" I suppose the most charitable interpretation is that he's talking about people he deems racist. Even that would be disturbing. An elected official - a mayor in particular - should not be threatening anyone for having thoughts he disagrees with. Much less should he be declaring that they should be afraid and that he intends to put their \"way of life\" at risk.\n\nIt's worse than that, though, because Mayor Brandon Scott of Baltimore has obviously demonstrated himself to be a typical far-Left race-baiting Democrat. We would know that even without these statements on MSNBC, simply because that's the only kind of person who gets elected to lead cities like Baltimore these days.\n\nFar-Left, race-baiting Democrats believe - and will tell you this explicitly, if they're in an honest mood - that all white people are inherently racist. They certainly believe that all white conservatives are inherently racist. Which means any threat issued obliquely against racists is intended for a particular racial group. This was an anti-white statement, make no mistake about it. Just as DEI is anti-white. Which means that Mayor Scott really has earned the moniker \"DEI Mayor\" after all, just for a slightly different reason.\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

      "text": "Is The Left Throwing Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Legacy Under The Bus?\n\nPat Brown and Dave Brown are authors of Black and White: How the Left is Destroying the Dream of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Founding Fathers .\n\nPat : This morning, I woke up to no headlines about MLK, Jr. Day in the Google feed! Not one! If I search under Google News, I do come up with a few stories about MLK in the conservative media. How fascinating is that? Has the Left abandoned MLK's dream for a new, more progressive version of race in America? It seems that the dream of Martin Luther King - that we all get judged by our characters and not our colors, that our children, black and white, would hold hands and be friends in the years ahead of his great speech in Washington D.C. - has turned into a nightmare. When I married a black man in 1979 and raised three non-white children, I depended on MLK's vision to come true, and I thought it would. In fact, it seems to me, we were doing well on that journey until the arrival of Barack Obama, and the beginnings of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nDave : When does Martin Luther King get canceled? By today's standards, his message of a colorblind society and racial unity seems dated. His message was blunt; equality, that's it. He had a dream that \"t he sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.\" But is that \"woke\" enough by today's standards? From everything we've seen over the last four years, that answer is no. We now have \"micro-aggressions\" and \"white fragility\" among dozens of other \"racial equity tools.\"\n\nPat : I cannot believe today that my grandchildren will suffer more from racism than the kids I raised in the 1980s and 1990s! Why, back then, I just worried about my non-white children not having as good opportunities as if they were white. I never worried about them having bad encounters with the police or being attacked by the Klan or White Supremacists. And they grew up pretty much without those worries. But, now, my two white grandchildren will either be labeled Nazis if they don't become \"allies\" with black power groups and practice \"anti-racism\" or, if they are too black, they will be required to hate white people and join Black Lives Matter or else.\n\nDave : We've learned recently per a Washington Post article that Proud Boy's member Enrique Tarrio, who identifies as Afro-Cuban, was part of a phenomenon called \"multiracial whiteness,\" where persons of color can now engage in the politics of \"aggression, exclusion, and domination.\" In my childhood, simpler phrases were used; they just called you a \"Milkdud\" or an \"Oreo.\" Or if they really wanted to impress upon you that your lack of adherence to leftist dogma was reviled, they would go with the \"Uncle Tom\" or \"bootlicker.\" Isn't that amazing? The people who claim to be the biggest champions of racial equality have invented new ways to well...be racist. We've jumped the shark, circled back around, and jumped the shark again. Each new day brings a new twist and turn in the \"fight for equality.\"\n\nPat : And what should white conservatives, black conservatives, biracial conservatives, Hispanic and Asian conservatives do as we enter 2021 and the race war has revved up with the new incoming administration? How do we speak up without losing our livelihoods, our \"free speech\" on social media, our friends, and, possibly, our lives? How to band together to inspire conservatives of all races and mixed races to fight apartheid in this country. Where do we go from here to keep MLK's dream alive?\n\nDave : How did we ruin such a straightforward message? Well, we didn't. The Left did, and they show no sign of letting up. So today, on Martin Luther King Jr's birthday, I'm nostalgic for yesteryear, where there are no \"safe spaces\" or \"trigger\" words. No kneeling for the National Anthem or fists raised in the air. Bring back the time when we as Americans recognized our imperfections, knew we could do better, and strove each day to make this country a little brighter, a little kinder, and a little closer to Martin Luther King's dream.\n\n\"Pat Brown and Dave Brown are the authors of Black and White: How the Left is Destroying the Dream of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Our Founding Fathers available Feb. 2nd\"\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion piece are the authors' own and do not necessarily represent those of The Daily Wire.\n\nContinue reading this exclusive article and join the conversation, plus watch free videos on DW+\n\nAlready a member?

      "text": "Americans Have World's Lowest Trust In Media: Survey\n\nFewer than one out of every three Americans trust the news media to report the facts, and conservatives have a lower level of trust than any other group in America, a global survey has found.\n\nAs a whole, the survey reveals that Americans have a 15% trust gap - reflecting a lower level of trust in the media than in any of the other 45 nations surveyed.\n\nIn all, nearly as many Americans strongly disagree that they trust the media (23%) than trust the media (29%). A total of 44% of U.S. citizens surveyed do not trust news outlets to report the facts.\n\nThe report also evaluated Americans based on political ideology and found that only Americans whose political views fall on the Left say the media portray them fairly: 51% of self-identifying liberals say the media reflect their views correctly, while 34% disagree. Fewer than one-third of centrists and one-fifth of conservatives agree. Self-identified conservatives have a 59 percentage point gap: 16% say the media portray conservatives accurately, while 75% disagree.\n\nPrevious surveys have found Americans' willingness to believe the news media falling to all-time lows, but the Associated Press blamed its readers , saying the trouble is \"not all Americans universally embrace core journalism values.\"\n\nFor the latest survey, the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford interviewed 29,000 people in 46 countries for its tenth annual digital news report , released Wednesday, but it confirmed something conservatives have long known.\n\nWhile President Joe Biden has received less negative media coverage than any president on record, only 5% of stories about President Donald Trump were positive during the early days of his presidency, according to the Pew Research Center. Many of those stories subsequently proved to be inaccurate. Sharyl Atkisson, the host of \"Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson\" on Sinclair Broadcasting, has kept what she calls \"the definitive list\" of \"media mistakes in the Trump era.\" The still-growing compilation now encompasses 156 separate news stories from the most widely exposed outlets.\n\n\"Journalists today no longer wear striped shirts and consider themselves the referees of the game, calling balls and strikes and trying to really make sure the game is played fairly,\" said former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who hosts a weekly news and commentary show on TBN, on Fox News shortly before the report came out. \"These are people who every day put on a team jersey. They're on Team Biden. They're on Team Left.\"\n\nMuch of the legacy media's reporting exists \"to shield the average American from the news,\" Huckabee said.\n\n\"We passionately believe that the only function the media serves today is making us hate each other more to cover up for the sins of the oligarchic elite,\" said Saager Enjeti. \"They're basically trying to Wishcast their old reality onto the new one for as long as they can.\"\n\nSean Hannity agreed the \"media mob,\" especially The New York Times, are \"nothing but the modern-day version of Pravda.\"\n\nThe authors of the study reflected on the report but offered mixed messages about how to restore the media's flagging legitimacy.\n\n\"Political partisans, especially on the right, trust the news much less and also do not feel news organizations cover their views fairly. News media may be able to respond to this concern,\" said one of the authors of the study, Rasmus Kleis Nielsen. But he immediately walked away from the idea of intellectual diversity. \"The question is what compromise that might entail on, for example, calling out unsubstantiated allegations of election fraud,\" he said. \"And how would any attempts to appeal more to those on the political right, often older white Americans, combine with attempts to appeal to younger and more diverse audiences, who are often more liberal? It is a clear option, but there may be trade-offs and choices here.\"\n\nIn other words, ignore the older white conservatives and go all-in with the Left. But that leaves a massive audience underserved and desperate for news coverage.\n\n\"One way of reading the survey results on Americans is that things couldn't be worse in terms of getting information,\" said Enjeti. \"The other is that people are more hungry than ever.\"\n\nThe views expressed in this piece are the author's own and do not necessarily represent those of The Daily Wire .\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Let's Get Our Filibuster History Right\n\nSen. Kyrsten Sinema last week claimed the Senate filibuster \"was created to bring together members of different parties to find compromise and coalition.\"\n\nSinema's statement is not historically accurate.\n\nNew York magazine's Jonathan Chait , a filibuster critic, charged Sinema with pushing \"a version of this fake history\" as part of an \"extraordinarily effective propaganda campaign\" by filibuster proponents. He countered, \"The filibuster emerged in the 19th century not by any design, but ... due to an interpretation of Senate rules which held that they omitted any process for ending debate. The first filibuster did not happen until 1837, and it was the result of exploiting this confusing rules glitch.\"\n\nChait's statement is not historically accurate.\n\nIn his anti-filibuster book, \" Kill Switch ,\" former Senate aide Adam Jentleson declared that \"Southern senators\" - both antebellum pro-slavery and post-Reconstruction segregationist senators - \"invented the filibuster,\" and stated that \"[i]n the eighty-seven years between the end of Reconstruction and 1964, the only bills that were stopped by filibusters were civil rights bills.\"\n\nJentleson's statement is not historically accurate either.\n\nGetting our filibuster story straight is difficult because the history is murky and everyone trying to tell the story has an angle. This includes me, but I shall do my best.\n\nLet's start at the beginning. The filibuster wasn't invented by Southern senators. It wasn't even invented in America. The credit should go to the senators of the Roman republic. Actually, one in particular.\n\nThe Romans had all sorts of obstructionist tactics, as historian Adam Lebovitz has detailed. One was obnuntiatio, breaking up a legislative session because of a bad omen, which could be done disingenuously. Plutarch wrote of an episode in which \"Pompey lyingly declared that he heard thunder, and most shamefully dissolved the assembly, since it was customary to regard such things as inauspicious, and not to ratify anything after a sign from heaven had been given.\"\n\nAnother was talking until nightfall when meetings ended, which was not called \"filibuster\" but diem consumere, to consume the day. Cato the Younger was the most famous practitioner of diem consumere. His biographers Rob Goodman and Jimmy Soni go as far as to state, \"The history of the filibuster ... essentially starts with Cato.\"\n\nCato's stemwinders - he could \"speak at the top of his lungs for hours\" - were wielded for populist ends. He waged a successful six-month campaign to prevent Rome's private tax collectors from jacking up their rates. He prevented Pompey, a general, from steering precious land to his troops. And spotting a threat to the Republic itself, with just a one-day talkathon, Cato denied Julius Caesar the ability to have a military parade in his honor while also running for political office.\n\nCaesar would soon seize autocratic power, and Cato would commit suicide rather than live under Caesar's rule. Goodman and Soni argue Cato's obstructionism - however high-minded - was a contributing factor to the Roman Republic's collapse. America's Founding Fathers, however, idolized Cato. George Washington's soldiers staged a play about Cato at Valley Forge. Patrick Henry's famous quote, \"Give me liberty or give me death,\" is derived from a line in that play.\n\nFilibuster critics correctly note that the tactic was not established in the Constitution nor was it codified in the initial congressional rules. But if the Founders feared the emergence of a Cato in their republican experiment, they could have explicitly banned diem consumere. They didn't.\n\nGranted, Thomas Jefferson wrote a rules manual that informally guided the early Senate, and he instructed, \"No one is to speak impertinently or beside the question, superfluously or tediously.\" However, legal scholars Catherine Fisk and Erwin Chemerinsky inform us that \"such debate occurred\" anyway. They also note, \"It is not clear ... whether extended debate with dilatory intent was considered an established practice at this point, or ... the bad habit of a few persons.\" Still, if the first congressional majorities believed that dilatory tactics were meant to be banned, they would have tightened up the rules at the first sign of violation.\n\nChait, citing work by filibuster historian Sarah Binder , placed the first American filibuster in 1837 - when the Whigs tried to stop the expunging of Andrew Jackson's censure from the congressional record. But Fisk and Chemerinsky determined that \"the strategic use of delay in debate is as old as the Senate itself,\" and they found the \"first recorded episode of dilatory debate\" occurred in 1790 \"when senators from Virginia and South Carolina filibustered to prevent the location of the first Congress in Philadelphia.\" One senator who favored the Philadelphia bill recounted, \"The design of the Virginians and the Carolina gentleman was to talk away the time, so that we could not get the bill passed.\"\n\nChait's mention of filibusterers \"exploiting this confusing rules glitch\" is a reference to Binder's argument that, in 1805, Vice President Aaron Burr inadvertently opened the door to filibustering when he recommended cleaning up the Senate rulebook and removing unnecessary provisions including the \"previous question motion.\" In Binder's telling, \"today, we know that a simple majority in the House can use the [previous question] rule to cut off debate. But in 1805, neither chamber used the rule that way.\" So the Senate got rid of it, not realizing its absence would allow senators to filibuster in the future.\n\nBut another filibuster historian, Gregory Koger , recently debunked the Burr origin story. He noted that in much of the 19th century the House had filibusters - more than the Senate in fact - even though it kept the \"previous question motion\" on the books.\n\nWhat's confusing is that the \"previous question motion\" was interpreted differently by the House at different times. It wasn't initially used to cut off debate. Then in 1811 it was, but in subsequent years it wasn't routinely used in that fashion. Not until the late 19th century were House procedures broadly and comprehensively reformed to greatly empower the majority and quash dilatory tactics.\n\nThe House history of the \"previous question motion\" speaks to Koger's main point: \"the meaning of rules is determined by legislative majorities, even if this means completely reversing the traditional interpretation of a term.\" In other words, any majority can interpret the rules however they want, whenever they want.\n\nChait looks to the Burr story to argue the filibuster \"emerged accidentally\" because \"nobody ever would create a system like this on purpose.\" But Koger counters that \"Senators have always had the power to determine what their rules mean, so they have always been able to limit or eliminate filibustering if a majority of the Senate is ready to vote for reform.\"\n\nRemember, in the past decade, narrow Senate majorities have limited the filibuster, deploying the so-called \"nuclear option\" to eliminate the filibuster for judicial and executive branch appointments. Koger concludes, \"[I]f a bare majority can end the filibuster now, then this has always been true, and there is no proof that their path to success would be easier if they had a [previous question] motion. For advocates of Senate reform, this poses an awkward truth: the Senate filibuster has persisted to this point because lots of senators have supported it.\"\n\nCase in point: When senators grew tired of the 20th century talking filibusters, they didn't abandon the parliamentary tool, they reformed it.\n\nFilibusters gummed up the floor, preventing any other work from getting done. So, as Binder explained this year in The Washington Post , \"Majority leader Mike Mansfield (D-Mont.) in 1970 suggested that the Senate invent a second 'shift' or 'track' of legislation. When a filibuster blocked the first track, Mansfield simply asked unanimous consent of all 100 senators to set aside the filibustered measure and move onto a new bill on a different 'track.' Mansfield's change did not require the Senate to make a formal change in its rules. All he really did was ask for consent to start tracking. Party leaders on both sides of the aisle thought tracking would help them make the floor schedule more predictable.\"\n\nThe two-track system is the current system. It is a system that allows for easily executed \"silent\" filibusters. It is a system created on purpose.\n\nIn Jentleson's story, the senators who supported the filibuster were racists. Of course, there's no disputing that for decades Southern segregationists weaponized the filibuster to protect racist Jim Crow laws. But Jentleson overstates the case when he claims that \"between the end of Reconstruction and 1964, the only bills that were stopped by filibusters were civil rights bills.\" Binder and Steven Smith, in their 1996 book \"Politics or Principle? Filibustering in the United States Senate,\" identified \"twenty-six measures\" proposed between Reconstruction and 1994 \"that would directly change public law\" that were \"clearly killed because of the ability of a minority of senators to prevent action.\" Only nine of those 26 were related to civil rights. And before 1949, \"the number of non-civil rights measures blocked by filibuster [was] about as large as the number of civil rights measures killed by filibuster.\"\n\nJentleson and others (including Barack Obama ) want to claim that the filibuster is defined by Jim Crow to argue that it has \"mainly served to empower a minority of predominantly white conservatives.\" But the filibuster is a tactic with no inherent ideological disposition. Cato used it against the authoritarians and plutocrats of his time. As the Civil War neared its close, the Radical Republicans (aided by Democrats) launched a successful filibuster thwarting President Lincoln's plan to admit the government of Louisiana back in the Union, because Louisiana had not yet given Blacks the vote. In this century, President George W. Bush began his second term with a major push to partially privatize Social Security, but when the Senate Democratic minority made clear it had the votes for a filibuster, Bush had no choice but to stand down .\n\nJust as supporters should not pretend that the filibuster was created to produce bipartisan harmony, critics should not pretend that the filibuster is both a historical accident and a linchpin of systemic racism. Let's tell the true story of the filibuster, not a pat story that serves the ideological purpose of one side of the debate, but the messy convoluted story that reminds us democracy has always been difficult to maintain.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion piece are the author's own and do not necessarily represent those of The Daily Wire.\n\nBill Scher is a contributing editor to Politico Magazine, co-host of the Bloggingheads.tv show \"The DMZ,\" and host of the podcast \"New Books in Politics.\" He can be reached at [email protected] or follow him on Twitter @BillScher.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Washington Post Slurs Best American Jurist Ever For 'Thinking Like A White Man'\n\nClarence Thomas's influence must not be reduced to his race because that characterization inherently contradicts everything he stands for.\n\nThe Washington Post's attempt to smear Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas for thinking like a white man is a completely incorrect interpretation of the justice's legal legacy.\n\nIn an article published on Wednesday , The Washington Post, which has a history of being racist towards black conservatives , claimed that Thomas is a \"Black justice whose rulings often resemble the thinking of White conservatives.\"\n\nThis gross mischaracterization by WaPo \"reporters\" Cleve R. Wootson Jr. and Marianna Sotomayor quickly earned the wrath of conservatives on Twitter prompting the corporate media to issue a \"clarification.\"\n\n\"A previous version of this story imprecisely referred to Justice Clarence Thomas's opinions as often reflecting the thinking of White conservatives, rather than conservatives broadly. That reference has been removed,\" the update at the top of the article states.\n\nSo the Washington Post just casually refers to Clarence Thomas as an Uncle Tom and it's just something that the rest of the journalists just let happen without speaking out. It's just a thing that happens and they are fine with it. https://t.co/XDg9L8dWNo\n\nIt is insulting that The Washington Post and so many others, such as President Joe Biden who significantly reduced his search for a qualified SCOTUS nominee based on racist and sexist standards , think it is acceptable to define the intelligence, honesty, or patriotism of someone, especially a Supreme Court justice, by his skin color.\n\nWaPo's attempt to insult Thomas not only exposes the corporate media outlet's hatred for what it deems to be \"white conservative\" politics but claims that anyone who earns the respect of conservatives through hard and admirable work must somehow be of the same disgusting breed.\n\nRace obsession is on the rise in U.S. politics and media thanks to Democrats' willingness to peddle it and that's why the left hates Thomas. The second black American to assume a position on the highest court in the land contradicts everything leftists preach about race and power.\n\nThomas's life is a beautiful example of the American dream and how he worked his way up with integrity and character from the streets of segregated Savannah, Ga., to the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C. As a result, he is repeatedly defamed by Democrats and their media cronies.\n\nThomas is no stranger to attacks from the corporate media and the left. During his confirmation, he was assailed with false reports of sexual assault that were peddled to stop him from assuming the bench. In recent years, the media has called for Thomas's impeachment due to these decades-old allegations, which were riddled with falsehoods and inconsistencies.\n\nIn 2015, Star Trek actor and leftist activist George Takei called Thomas a \"clown in black face\" because the justice dissented in the Supreme Court's Obergefell ruling. Shortly after, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd said Thomas was a \"creepy guy who acted pervy\" in an effort to dig up those past allegations despite countless defenses of his character from his women colleagues. Just last year, Amazon censored the justice's documentary for no apparent reason other than a political one. More recently, the New Yorker tried to drudge up a controversy , which was a dud, over Thomas based on his wife's political activities.\n\nDespite the left's attempts to tear him down, Thomas remains a resilient fighter for Americans and the Constitution. He cares about protecting unborn babies , freedom of speech , and preserving the nation's essence. The left constantly assails Thomas but for what? The crime of consistently ruling in line with the philosophy and vision of the Founding Fathers who wanted \"liberty and justice for all.\"\n\nIt's fair to say that after the justice's more than 30 \"distinguished\" years on the bench, The Washington Post's interpretation of Thomas is all wrong. Thomas's thinking has shaped the way all conservatives today think, regardless of their race. He is a great thinker who is not only admired in conservative circles but has inspired them. Thomas's influence cannot and should not be reduced to his race because that characterization inherently contradicts everything he stands for.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "No, Cancel Culture Isn't Stolen From Black People\n\nWhen I lived in Thailand for three years, I saw a lot of curious attempts to mimic American culture. There is Thai hip hop , Thai country , and even Thai heavy metal . I lived through three Thai Christmases and Halloweens (despite the country being 95 percent Buddhist). I sat through innumerable Thai soap operas as I ate lunch at a cafeteria near work.\n\nYou can judge for yourself whether any of these things succeed. I confess I was typically more dismayed than delighted, although I tried to remind myself that imitation is the highest form of flattery.\n\nNot so for Clyde McGrady and the editors at the Washington Post. McGrady in a April 2 article explains that he views imitation as yet another manifestation of \"cultural appropriation.\" That includes conservatives (he focuses exclusively on attacking white conservatives, but obviously there are plenty of non-white conservatives) who are raising alarm bells regarding the dangers of cancel culture. Because, you see, the idea of \"cancelation\" itself derives from black culture.\n\nPerhaps the most ridiculous and depressing aspect of McGrady's article is that in the Post's April 5 print edition, it appeared directly next to an article about black journalist Alexi McCammond, who in mid-March parted ways with Teen Vogue over some old tweets that \"included comments on the appearance of Asian features, derogatory stereotypes about Asians and slurs for gay people,\" according to The New York Times.\n\nOne wonders if WaPo editors are so blinded by their ideological zealotry that they can't perceive the irony in featuring an article shaming white people for \"cultural appropriation\" of cancel culture alongside an article in which a young black woman was canceled for something she wrote as a teenager.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of absurdities in McGrady's article. There is his claim that \"'cancel culture' is a new favorite way to describe what's making them [conservatives] upset (way punchier than 'political correctness').\" Not quite.\n\nHow about the attempts by Big Tech to silence ideas they don't like, as we recently saw with Amazon's removal of Ryan Anderson's book on transgenderism? Or perhaps Kevin Hart's forced resignation from the Oscars? Or a black security guard fired from his job for using the n-word in the course of telling a student not to direct the word at him? Conservatives have complained about all of these.\n\nOr consider McGrady's frustration that \"'Cancel' and 'woke' are the latest terms to originate in black culture only to be appropriated into the white mainstream and subsequently thrashed to death.\"  He bemoans \"the commodification of Black slang\" as \"practically an American tradition.\"\n\nWhat would McGrady prefer? That white Americans insulate themselves from black culture and refuse to listen to black music, eat black-influenced cuisine, or use black-originating vocabulary? Wouldn't that be racist, egregiously more racist than \"appropriating\" black culture?\n\nBlack culture is American culture, and always has been. This is the complex beauty of cultural intersection. Yes, of course, practically every major American musical genre - blues, bluegrass, country, jazz, rock - is indebted to black culture in one way or another. That's because black culture has created wonderfully interesting art.\n\nWhite musicians borrow from these traditions and create their own unique style. Perhaps some of them are cynical and self-obsessed, but the white American musicians I love the most - Stevie Ray Vaughan, Johnny Winter, the Black Keys - are effusive in their praise of the black culture from which their sound originates. Indeed, in an old video of Johnny Winter and Dr. John, Winter explicitly complains about musicians ashamed of their musical heritage.\n\nFor McGrady, race is the preeminent prism for interpreting contemporary social and political developments. \"Not only have these words been appropriated from Black culture,\" he writes, \"but they have also been weaponized to sneer at the values of many young Black liberals.\"\n\nNo, cancel culture is the weapon and it is wielded at blacks and whites, conservatives and liberals alike. How many articles must conservative publications publish bemoaning how cancel culture is not only affecting conservatives, but liberal writers, editors, academics, and celebrities? Go talk to Bret Weinstein , Lindsay Shepherd , or Donald McNeil .\n\nMcGrady writes: \"'Cancel' is now just another word that White people have taken and run into the ground.\" How is such a claim not patently racist? How has our culture, and our supposedly leading media institutions, come to accept such asinine, antagonist gibberish as worthy of print? That such a sentence would appear alongside an article describing how a once widely hailed black female editor was canceled for some old tweets she apologized for demonstrates the degree of comedy and tragedy that defines our zeitgeist.\n\nBlack culture is beautiful and inexhaustibly interesting. Indeed, there cannot be a truly American culture without the indelible influence of black Americans, whether it be their contributions to language, music, cuisine, literature, politics, or anything else. An exclusively white America, stripped of our shared racial and cultural heritages, would be impoverished. Most white Americans know this, celebrate black culture, and borrow heavily from it, as well they should.\n\nMcGrady appears to want it both ways. White Americans are cultural appropriators when they integrate black culture into their own life and language. Yet such persons would undoubtedly be racists if they refused to accept the contributions of black Americans as good and worthy of emulation. In this confused paradigm, there is no way out of the smear of racism. It's no wonder people like John McWhorter call wokeism an acidic, socially destructive religion.\n\nAbove all else, I would want to leave McGrady and those sympathetic to his opinions with a warning and a plea. First, the warning. The WaPo cares less about people than it does about its ideological vision. They, like The New York Times, Vogue, and so many other institutions, will have no trouble canceling anyone who fails to maintain conformity with the progressivist project. They've proved that time and again.\n\nThus my plea: realize who is really involved in racial exploitation by promoting the misnomered \"anti-racist\" balderdash that only further frays the fabric of American civic cohesion and leaves an increasing number of casualties in its wake.\n\nCancel culture is real, and the victim list keeps growing. Its victims span every race, sex, ethnicity, and socio-economic group in this country. In its malevolence and refusal to forgive, it is the very antithesis of the Christian religion that so deeply informed our Founders, and generations of religiously devout black Americans. It is racist, hateful, and self-destructive. I pray our nation realizes this before it consumes us all.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Research Shows Critical Race Theory Is Actually Making People More Racist\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced on Sept. 5 an end to critical race theory training in federal agencies. As explained by Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, the policy change targets \"training or propaganda\" pertaining to \"white privilege\" and efforts to advance the claim that \"the United States is an inherently racist or evil country or ... that any race or ethnicity is inherently racist or evil.\" On Sept. 22, the president extended this ban to companies doing business with the federal government. He was right on both counts.\n\nCritical race theory and similar academic left perspectives over the last decade stormed the political mainstream through a surge in news and popular media attention. As a result, today politicians , celebrities , and corporations employ \"critical,\" or woke, rhetoric. Even comic books push critical themes despite hostile reactions from their readers.\n\nOn the left, this dynamic fueled the \" Great Awokening ,\" the leftward radicalization of white liberals on racial issues. Liberal whites are now to the left of blacks on key measures of race. Moreover, as evidenced by a recent Hidden Tribes report and the mugshots of arrested Antifa members , the far left is overwhelmingly white.\n\nBut how has critical rhetoric affected right-leaning whites? Are white conservatives likewise getting woke to these Marxism-inspired perspectives ? Are they rejecting normative colorblindness, the former standard of antiracism? Have they embraced The New York Times' revisionist account of American history? Do they accept that only whites are capable of racism , that all whites are racist, and that white identity itself is uniquely pathological and deserving of abolition?\n\nTo the contrary, it seems that white identity's renewed salience - its \"visibility,\" in the language of Peggy McIntosh - is contributing to a defensive response. Conservative whites are increasingly likely to describe being white as \"very\" or \"extremely\" important (see figure below). A clear majority of white Republicans, but few white Democrats, describe anti-white and anti-black discrimination as comparable problems in American society.\n\nThen there is the proverbial elephant in the room: Trump. Notwithstanding the often disingenuous and sometimes absurd racism allegations some level at him, it is undeniable that Trump frequently transgresses norms of political correctness in communicating his views to the public. Such rhetoric resonates with people who appreciate Trump's blunt style or delight in trolling the left, but it also resonates with people for whom white identity is especially important . The latter group includes the alt-right, a white nationalistic movement that emerged in the wake of the Great Awokening.\n\nIn my dissertation research, I approach white nationalism and conservatism as rival philosophies competing for the loyalties of right-leaning whites. I consider whether exposure to critical themes in popular media might have contributed to a white identity backlash or \" white-lash \" on the right. Illustrative examples include:\n\nI began my inquiry by searching the frequency with which the terms \"white people,\" \"whites,\" and \"white men\" appeared online since the year 2000. I recorded \"hits\" for articles criticizing white people and identity and for \"anti-critical\" articles, those arguing against critical themes (see Schorr forthcoming, Appendix 197 for details).\n\nThe figure below displays search results alongside trends in white identification - or \"How important is being white to your identity?\" - for self-identified \"liberal,\" \"moderate,\" and \"conservative\" whites in the American National Election Studies Time Series.\n\nThe proportion of conservatives describing white identity as \"very\" or \"extremely\" important (\"high identifiers\") increased from 32.1 percent in 2012 to 36.6 percent in 2016. High-identifying liberals increased slightly (23.2 percent to 24.6 percent) as well, while high-identifying moderates decreased (32.7 percent to 29.4 percent). The timeline is truncated because the American National Election Studies first included the white identification measure in 2012; however, the trend lines suggest recent polarization on white identity.\n\nTo subject the whitelash hypothesis to a more rigorous test, I conducted a survey experiment from Aug. 1-29, 2019. In total, 1,527 white respondents were treated with \"primes\" representative of contemporary discussions of race and then questioned on topics of identity and group attitudes. I focused specifically on self-identified conservative and high white-identifying respondents.\n\nTo capture the effects of critical rhetoric, I used an excerpt from Macy Sto. Domingo's \" 18 Things White People Seem To Not Understand (Because, White Privilege) .\" Among white conservatives, this \"critical prime\" predicted 8 percent increased support (weighted mean) for whites \"work[ing] together to improve the position of their group,\" in comparison to the \"control group.\"\n\nTo further probe the effects of critical themes on identity, I asked respondents to rate the importance of certain factors to being \"truly American.\" Here, critical prime exposure appears to have narrowed the boundaries of the \"in-group.\"\n\nFor example, conservative whites expressed 12 percent greater agreement that only those with \"American ancestry\" are truly American. High white-identifiers expressed 20 percent greater agreement with this same claim and 8 percent greater support for restricting American identity to those \"born in the U.S.\" Critical prime exposure also increased conservative \"ethnocentrism,\" or net \"feeling thermometer\" preference for whites over minorities by 5 percent.\n\nIn most cases, findings were the opposite for white leftists. Exposure to the critical prime thus created a wider gap between the racial attitudes reported by left-leaning and conservative (also low/high white-identifying) whites.\n\nI next considered the effects of anti-critical and conciliatory primes. The former was excerpted from Dennis Prager's \" The Fallacy of White Privilege .\" As the title suggests, Prager challenges the credibility of critical themes.\n\nThe conciliatory prime was excerpted from David French's \" Racism and the Indelible Impact of Personal Experience .\" French does not address critical themes. Rather, he recounts becoming more aware of racial prejudice in day-to-day interactions after he and his wife, who are white, adopted their black daughter.\n\nBefore analyzing survey findings, my expectation was that exposure to anti-critical rhetoric would similarly mobilize identification and prejudice from the target groups. I was half right. Surprisingly, the Prager article was associated with sharp reductions in identification: High-identifying whites expressed less concern for whites' comparative social position (-11 percent), job security (-15 percent), and treatment under the law (-9 percent).\n\nFindings from the conciliatory prime were also mixed. High white-identifiers were more willing to restrict American identity to those with \"American ancestry\" (8 percent), but they also expressed 14 percent greater agreement that \"racial minorities are, on average, just as patriotic as white Americans.\" Crucially, white conservative ethnocentrism dropped 24 percent. Thus, findings from both \"conservative\" primes offered cause for optimism whereas findings from the critical prime were more consistently undesirable.\n\nMuch can be said regarding the conceptual and normative deficiencies of critical race theory and whiteness studies , including how these perspectives demean people of color. My research concerns their practical deficiencies. Insofar as white identity polarization is a reciprocal process , critical race theory and company likely advance the cause of white nationalism.\n\nThe president is right to oppose critical race theory, and opponents of racism should applaud his efforts.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "After Court Strikes Down Affirmative Action, MIT Data Vindicates Discrimination Claims Of Asian Students\n\nAfter years of debate, we finally have definitive evidence to prove that affirmative action policies for college admissions have perpetuated discrimination against Asian American students. But \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" (DEI) die-hards can't accept it.\n\nLast month, MIT became the first elite college to release its racial demographic data for the Class of 2028, showing that after years of static admission rates for Asian Americans, the percentage of admitted Asian students jumped up seven points - from 40 percent to 47 percent . In the days that followed, this proved to be a pattern across many college campuses, as more admissions data trickled in from other institutions, such as at Columbia University, where Asian Americans went up by nine points, and Brown University, where they went up by four points. In some cases, like at Yale and Princeton, the results were mixed , apparently vindicating proponents of affirmative action.\n\nYet the issue is more nuanced than it appears, as many of these colleges report that some percentage of students refused to disclose their race. Richard Sander, a law professor at UCLA, indicates that many of these are likely Asian American students who \"know they're the target.\" And it is still possible that some colleges are subtly refusing to enforce the Supreme Court decision. The majority of the results, though, vindicate what many Asian Americans have known for decades.\n\nThe whole college-admissions landscape changed last year when the Supreme Court ruled on the landmark case Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard (2023), overturning race-based affirmative action policies nationwide. The case hinged on Asian American students who were discriminated against by the admissions boards of elite universities, and the suit itself revealed that college admissions officers were routinely giving Asian applicants lower personality scores as part of a supposedly \"holistic\" process. Nevertheless, leftist activists pushed the narrative that Asian Americans that opposed affirmative action policies were actually \" pawns \" for white supremacist agendas.\n\nWhat the activists mean by \"pawns\" is that they claim that opposition to affirmative action is a stance aligned with white supremacist thought, and thus any Asian American who would take such a position is, in essence, a \"useful idiot\" for an agenda that doesn't benefit Asians. Yet, as the recent admissions numbers show, anti-Asian discrimination was in fact the norm prior to the Supreme Court decision, blowing away the narrative that Asians were mere pawns for white supremacist interests.\n\nOne article published in The Nation after the Supreme Court decision, titled \" Asian American Conservatives Have Become Key Allies of White Supremacy ,\" goes one step further, dispensing with the \"pawn\" narrative altogether to argue that \"Asian American anti-affirmative action activists have not been simply 'used' by white activists and duped into this white supremacist policy. They are active, militant co-conspirators with white conservatives.\"\n\nThe article also bizarrely states that \"reversing affirmative action only strengthens the population of white students at the expense of Black and other minority students, including Asian Americans.\" This sleight-of-hand tries to make it look like affirmative action actually helps Asian Americans by positing that affirmative action increases the population of minority students as a whole (as Asians are a racial minority group) while ignoring that Asian Americans aren't the \"right\" minority group for such a boost - Asian Americans are in fact harmed by affirmative action, despite being a racial minority.\n\nSo, then, why was there so much emphasis on the narrative of white supremacy in the first place? There are two reasons. First of all, the fact that Asian Americans have managed to academically outperform white Americans and all other racial groups shows that there is no white supremacist bias in standardized testing. Many colleges have dropped SAT requirements, and some law schools have been dropping LSAT requirements as well, due to leftist activists in the legal field (and there are a lot of such people in law school) claiming that such standardized tests have been used to lower the population of minority students.\n\nIt is worth noting that Asian Americans are minority students. Indeed, Asians make up far less of the American population than black and Latino people do. Because of this, many institutions of higher education and workplaces have switched to using the term \" underrepresented minority ,\" which is defined specifically as every minority group besides Asians.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine a cabal of white supremacists sitting in smoke-filled rooms, strategically designing the SAT so that Asian Americans - a miniscule population at the time most standardized tests were synthesized - would, on average, perform better at the tests than white people, just so this supposed white supremacist cabal would have plausible deniability against future accusations of racism.\n\nThe other reason why many in our college-educated class accuse Asian Americans of collusion with white supremacists is because the livelihoods and egos of so many activists and administrative apparatchiks depend on such a narrative being true. Workplaces and institutions of higher learning are increasingly staffed in ever-greater numbers by various administrators in departments dedicated to DEI. Just like a janitor needs trash to exist to justify their job's existence, DEI officers need evidence of white supremacy (or patriarchy, or some other form of alleged discrimination) to justify their continued employment.\n\nIn addition, social justice ideology reigns hegemonic in practically all humanities departments in the country, and the sunk-cost fallacy comes in: People need to believe what they've been taught to be true, or else they would have to realize they wasted precious years of their life dedicated to a falsehood. So if white supremacy is the bogeyman - or perhaps they'd say bogeyperson - they need to keep whacking it like a piñata, although they may have to have a \"Latinx\" do it to avoid accusations of cultural appropriation.\n\nIndeed, while there is now definitive proof that affirmative action policies have discriminated against Asian Americans for decades, some people still need to believe otherwise to maintain their cushy positions and their sense of mental stability. But such falsehoods cannot be used to dictate policies that affect the lives of millions of Americans.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

It is the most precise explanation that you will ever see for why outcomes for black Americans lag behind those of many other ethnic and racial groups.\n\nHere I explain my idea of the \"bluffing equilibrium\" that stifles public discussion in America about persistent racial inequality. For more of the same, follow us at https://t.co/Wy8KpOFZx9 pic.twitter.com/x4a9DuccwE\n\n- Glenn Loury (@GlennLoury) December 29, 2020\n\nRarely has so much good sense been made in so short a period of time. Loury talks about an equilibrium of tacit agreements under which nobody talks about issues like black on black crime, or the status of the black family, or underperformance of black students, all in order to protect black dignity. There is no doubt that these agreements are in place. Loury is well-placed to understand them in the academy from which they are mainly sprung. This is where the bluff comes in.\n\nThe bluff is the belief that nobody will break these agreements and tell the truth that black Americans in fact have agency and a degree of responsibility for their own conditions. Loury is asking us to call this bluff and promising that if we do the critical race theorists will \"have no cards.\"\n\nHe is absolutely right. The idea that the solution to crime, poverty, and academic underperformance among black Americans will be fixed by addressing vague and amorphous notions like systemic racism and privilege theory is flat-out absurd. The only people who truly benefit from this nonsense are those who promulgate it, earning millions by selling white people a quick cure for guilt.\n\nLoury posits that if more black people like himself and his co-host, Columbia University professor John McWhorter, start breaking these agreements of silence, then more white people will too. Well, I'm a white person taking him up on his offer.\n\nI will not pretend that the problems black Americans face will magically wither if more soccer moms read \"White Fragility\" in their book clubs. I will not pretend that police are responsible for anything but a tiny minority of the black men, women, and children being gunned down in our nation when it is blatantly obvious that the bigger problem is crime itself. I urge all Americans to speak these truths.\n\nNone of this is to say that historical inequity does not play a role in the condition of the nation's black communities, but the past can't be changed. The future can. As Loury points out, the engine of the American economy has lifted millions of non-white immigrants into great success in America, which would be an impossibility if the real issue is white supremacy.\n\nFar too often, serious solutions like charter schools and school choice, enhanced policing tactics, and strengthening the black family are ignored because of these tacit agreements. The problem is not in 1619, it is in 2020.\n\nLoury is very much a black intellectual in the conservative tradition of Thomas Sowell and the recently deceased Walter Williams. Also like them, he is a rare voice.\n\nSowell has joked that he and Williams have been nervous about taking the same plane because if it went down the movement would be gone. Sowell and Williams were largely ignored by the left and deserved more attention from white conservatives, quite possibly as a result of these very tacit agreements. This is a mistake that white conservatives must not repeat.\n\nTake Loury's challenge. Call the progressive anti-racism bluff. It will do far more to improve outcomes for black Americans than tearing down statues or posting positive things about Black Lives Matter on social media. Speak the truth. The worst they can do is call you a racist. And hey, they are going to do that anyway.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Why Won't The Left Admit Schools Teach Critical Theory And Defend It On The Merits?\n\nBy now, most Americans know that critical race theory is real and that it's being taught widely in public schools.\n\nThis isn't a semantics debate. Students are being taught racial hierarchies, along with the idea that the United States was founded on white supremacy, and that the U.S. Constitution, our legal system, and American ideals like freedom and equality all work to perpetuate and sustain systemic racism.\n\nThere are mountains of evidence of this. The work of Christopher Rufo and others has exposed critical race theory's many manifestations, not just in public schools but inside major corporations and even the U.S. military.\n\nYet the left has refused to debate critical race theory on the merits. Instead, the corporate press, Hollywood, and woke Twitter bluechecks keep insisting that it doesn't even exist, it's just a fantasy conjured up by racist Trumpers trying to scare white voters into electing Republicans.\n\nJust look at the left's response to the historic Republican sweep of Virginia on Tuesday. Glenn Younkin's campaign, their theory goes, falsely claimed that critical race theory was being taught in Virginia public schools. Racist white Virginians, terrified at the idea their kids would have to learn the truth about slavery and racism in America, elected Youngkin, who is also a racist.\n\n(That these same voters also made history by electing Winsome Sears, a black woman, as lieutenant governor, and Jason Miyares, an Hispanic man, as attorney general, is conveniently ignored in this narrative.)\n\nTheir key talking point is that critical race theory isn't even taught in Virginia schools . Cable news talking heads like MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace incessantly dropped it into her election-night commentary, saying critical race theory, \"which isn't real,\" swung the suburbs 15 points to the \"Trump insurrection-endorsed Republican.\"\n\nJulian Castro called it a \"fantasy world.\" Larry Sabato called it a \"phony issue.\" Joy Reid called it a \"coded boogeyman.\"\n\nThis is INSANE.\n\nMSNBC's Nicolle Wallace: \"Critical Race Theory, which isn't real, turned the suburbs 15 points to the Trump insurrection endorsed Republican.\" pic.twitter.com/ARppUNUuGy\n\n- Townhall.com (@townhallcom) November 3, 2021\n\nAfter the election, humorless comedians like Seth Meyers kept hammering away at it . \"Republican and Fox News have successfully weaponized the panic over so-called critical race theory, but I'm sorry, it shouldn't be radical to teach children about the history of racism in American society.\"\n\nExamples abound, both before and after the election, but you get the idea. For the left, critical race theory is nothing more than an obscure and harmless legal theory that's been twisted into something sinister by racist MAGA Republicans. Months ago, legacy media outlets were insisting that critical race theory is a \"moral panic\" and an \"obsession\" of racist Republicans. It's what white conservatives denounce whenever their kids have to study \"real\" American history in school.\n\nThe problem for the left is that no one outside their cloistered milieu believes this. There's been too much original-source reporting about the prevalence of critical race theory in public institutions for any honest person to think otherwise.\n\nSo here's my question: why doesn't the left just debate critical race theory on the merits? People like Joy Reid and Wajahat Ali clearly agree with its central tenets . They obviously think America was founded on white supremacy, and that racism pervades our civic life and public institutions. Why not just come out and say, \"You know what? Critical race theory should be taught in public schools, because it's the best way to expose kids to the truth about America.\"\n\nWhy pretend something that you fervently agree with doesn't exist? Why play shell games about how to define critical race theory? Why not just take the broadest definition that all sides can agree to and go from there? Why not make the case for why we should base school curricula on it, why corporations should train their workforces in it, why it should be the legal basis for racial reparations and the mass redistribution of wealth?\n\nIf people are confused about what critical race theory is, why not explain what it really is? Why argue that its attendant ideas and policy prescriptions are correct and desirable, and make the case for why they will make America a better, more peaceful, and just society?\n\nLeftists won't do that because they know that most Americans find the ideas at the heart of critical race theory repulsive, and rightly so.\n\nThis is also why the left never openly debates the merits of, say, mass illegal immigration, which they obviously support. Instead, they pretend to oppose it, or argue that the border isn't really in crisis. Same with the Black Lives Matter riots last summer, the effects of pandemic lockdowns, the dangers of transgender ideology and bathroom policies. Whatever the issue, they pretend the thing they support isn't even real, then call their opponents racists and bigots for insisting that it is.\n\nThe bad news for the left is that this tactic obviously isn't working. So I look forward to frank, open, and honest debates about teaching racial hierarchies in elementary school, the merits of totally open borders, and a rich discourse on why urban rioting for racial justice is a public good.\n\nJust kidding. The media assures me none of that's even real.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Al Sharpton. Mr. Respectable.\n\nReintroduce yourself to one of the president's most trusted advisers\n\nThe persistent whitewashing of Al Sharpton's revolting past will always be a mystery to me. But if we're to trust Politico's reporting today , Sharpton has emerged as the go-to civil rights guru for the Obama administration. \"If anything,\" writes Glenn Thrush, \"the Ferguson crisis has underscored Sharpton's role as the national black leader Obama leans on most, a remarkable personal and political transformation for a man once regarded with suspicion and disdain by many in his own party.\"\n\nDraw whatever conclusions you like from this development. But if the point of the piece is to detail the revival of a once-reviled public figure, offering a single purified paragraph detailing the events that first made the man famous seems a bit disingenuous. Perhaps a little more context is necessary for those who didn't live through his violent circus.\n\nSo let's revisit.\n\nThree decades ago, the overweight, track-suited, medallion-bedecked Sharpton led a rally against a white-owned clothing store in Harlem that was subsequently burned to the ground by a deranged black protester, killing eight people.\n\nNo, Sharpton didn't simply show up at \"a rally,\" he was the host of radio show in New York where for weeks he personally stoked racial animosity over what amounted to a dispute regarding rent. On that show, Sharpton allowed an array of shameless racists and anti-Semites to exacerbate the situation with their own ugly violent language. The venomous protests, fueled in part by his show and presence, soon began to resemble a mob. And Roland Smith Jr. - the deranged murderer - didn't simply burn down Freddie's . He went in with a gun and asked all the black patrons to leave and then killed everyone else. So, in the end, the \"white interloper,\" as Sharpton predicted, \"did not expand his business in Harlem.\"\n\nAround that time, he was convicted of defaming a white upstate New York prosecutor he falsely accused of raping black teenager Tawana Brawley in the 1980s, an infamous case that made him famous as the caricature of an inflammatory inner-city preacher immortalized by Tom Wolfe in Bonfire of the Vanities. adviser\n\nSharpton makes Reginald Bacon look like a cherished saint. Sharpton didn't only accuse Steven Pagones of abduction and rape and destroy his career, he perhaps destroyed a teenager's life, and generated more racial tension in an already-tense city. When he was successfully sued for defamation, it should also be mentioned, he never paid the $345,000 in damages - allowing others to do it for him. Last we heard, he still claimed that Brawley was right. So who better to offer sage advice to the president of the United States?\n\nSharpton often, regrettably, played to type: During the 1991 Crown Heights riots in Brooklyn, Sharpton stoked black rage after a Hasidic Jewish driver killed a young boy with his car. At the child's funeral, Sharpton railed against Jewish \"diamond merchants\" who bought their wares from apartheid South Africa, then ran down black kids in Brooklyn.\n\nWhy \"regrettably\"? Sharpton doesn't regret it, why do you. He wasn't playing to type, as anyone who was in New York in the 80s and 90s could tell you, he was the type. During Crown Heights riots, after helping provoke black rioters and looters, who beat up a couple of religious Jews (\"diamond merchants\") and murdered Yankel Rosenbaum to the chants of \"kill the Jew\", the president's top civil rights adviser and tough guy, helped quell the violence by saying: \"If the Jews want to get it on, tell them to pin their yarmulkes back and come over to my house.\"\n\nThrough all these events Sharpton fancied himself the preeminent leader of New York City's African-American community, but then always denied his actions had anything to do with the events that  transpired. Thrush imagines that Sharpton's mere presence remains an irritant to many \"white conservatives\" ( like Larry Elder and Jason Riley ), but you have wonder why he isn't an irritant to any decent person.\n\nFollow David Harsanyi on Twitter.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "The DOJ's Lawsuit Against Yale Is How To Win The Culture War\n\nIn a Bengali poem, one verse roughly translates to \"the maddening rage of a caged impotent.\" It fits the left's reaction to the Trump administration's executive order banning critical race training in federal departments and lawsuit against Yale University for discrimination against white and Asian applicants.\n\nFor a long time, the overwhelming majority of sane, hardworking people had to endure being ruled by a handful of ideologues and their crackpot theories, in a long march continued unopposed. Bafflingly, for decades there was zero substantive pushback among Republican lawmakers, even from ostensibly conservative presidents. That has now changed. Whoever takes up the mantle of post-Trump conservatism, things are not going back to meek subservience.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has sued Yale for discriminating against Asians and white applicants in undergraduate admissions. The lawsuit argues that qualified Asians and whites are discriminated against in favor of black applicants, and are likely to only win one-quarter of admissions compared to lesser qualified people based solely on race, in what the DOJ considers to be affirmative action.\n\nThis is an escalation on the culture war front and comes after a group of Asians sued Harvard University for discrimination. The Trump administration argues these slanted admissions policies violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and Yale might lose federal funding if it is found to be discriminating on the basis of race. Reuters reported that Yale receives more than $630 million annually from just the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe lawsuit followed two years of investigation. In a news release , Assistant Attorney General Eric S. Dreiband said, \"Illegal race discrimination by colleges and universities must end,\" adding that \"All persons who apply for admission to colleges and universities should expect and know that they will be judged by their character, talents, and achievements and not the color of their skin. To do otherwise is to permit our institutions to foster stereotypes, bitterness, and division.\"\n\nLeftists are worried this will be the start of a conservative-led rollback of race-based affirmative action in favor of merit, after the federal government supported Asian-Americans in their lawsuit against Harvard. The DOJ simply argues that it opposes race-based discrimination and the Civil Rights Act states that federal-funded programs cannot discriminate on the basis of race, even in favor of affirmative action.\n\nJoe Biden wants to immediately reverse the Title IX due process rules that were formed under Trump Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. He prefers a violence against women plan . He recently stated that an eight-year-old can self-identity as transgender. These are all ideas rooted in leftist critical theory , and in a normal world, these would be reason enough to not vote for him.\n\nIt is, however, important to note the direction of conservative governments in the coming culture war. Consider the Trump administration's executive order banning critical race theory after the extensive investigations of a journalist named Christopher Rufo .\n\nThe administration issued an executive order prohibiting any federal agency or contractor from using any form of critical race theory arguing that the United States or white people are either fundamentally racist or sexist, or that \"an individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously,\" citing Rufo's work. The admin has suspended such trainings and questioned race-obsessed corporate hiring goals , such as those put in place due to the Black Lives Matter protests, \"to combat offensive and anti-American race and sex stereotyping and scapegoating.\"\n\nThe executive order also combats concepts of \"white privilege,\" \"systemic racism,\" \"intersectionality,\" and \"unconscious bias.\" Conservatives used to losing in the culture war due to an instinctive aversion to government efforts suddenly find themselves at a curious position where they can see that they are capable of dictating how this game is played, and the majority of the people quietly support it.\n\nFor the first time in decades, the diversity bureaucrats dividing the country on the basis of race, class, and sex are on their backfoot , worried about losing federal funding and being sued. That, added with Trump administration's rollback of Obama-era Title IX kangaroo courts, is more than anything any conservative leader has done for social conservatives in more than 30 years. Politics is about using power to enforce policy after winning an election, a lesson that conservatives across the Anglosphere forgot, and are now slowly relearning.\n\nPolls after polls have suggested that Americans disproportionately oppose any type of affirmative action and quotas based on critical race theory. For example, Gallup argues that \"Majorities said that high school grades (73%) and scores on standardized tests (55%) should be major factors in college admissions, while 50% said that the types of courses the student took should be a major factor.\"\n\nAsian and Indian Americans especially align with white conservatives to oppose racial quotas, and prefer merit . Even in California, a majority is set to reject quotas and affirmative action. Only now, for the first time and under Trump, the elected conservative leaders have paid heed to these massive demographics opposed to further divisive politics based on race.\n\nIn the tele-series \"Chernobyl\" about the Russian nuclear disaster, one of the most memorable scenes is when the scientist Ulana Khomyuk meets her boss to register a complaint. She knows something is wrong in Chernobyl, but is being stonewalled by this incompetent lard of a man who knows nothing other than the ideological garbage his party teaches.\n\nShe gets frustrated and cries out that she's a nuclear physicist, and he is a cobbler. He smirks, and replies, \"Yes, I used to work in a shoe factory, and now I am in charge. To the workers of the world!\" For years, middle managers and bureaucrats in American academia blathering about \"diversity and inclusion\" have likewise kneecapped merit and quality in favor of getting to manipulate outcomes.

      "text": "Why The Media Will Never Tell You 85 Percent Of Americans Oppose Race-Based College Admissions\n\nThis week, Harvard University went to trial over the claim it discriminates against Asian-American applicants. Affirmative action moved back onto the main stage of American politics, particularly as this is an issue where replacing Justice Anthony Kennedy with Justice Brett Kavanaugh could make a difference at the Supreme Court. Yet the political discussion of this hot-button issue again proceeds with little recognition of a basic fact: racial preferences in college admissions are wildly unpopular.\n\nEighty-five percent of Americans oppose considering race in the college admissions process, according to \" Hidden Tribes ,\" a recent report from the left-of-center group More in Common. Of the seven \"tribes\" identified in the report, racial preferences were supported only by progressive activists, the furthest-left 8 percent of Americans. Ironically, progressive activists are almost the least diverse of the tribes, except the furthest-right 6 percent.\n\nOnly 40 percent of progressive activists oppose racial preferences in college admissions. But among traditional liberals (a group comprising 11 percent of Americans), 72 percent oppose racial preferences. Passive liberals (15 percent), who have more African-Americans, women, and younger people than average, are several points even less supportive.\n\nNor is the \"Hidden Tribes\" polling an outlier. In September, public television's WGBH published a poll finding 72 percent of adults disagreed with prior Supreme Court rulings allowing colleges to consider race in making admissions decisions. Indeed, racial preferences were disapproved by majorities of black, Hispanic, and Asian respondents in the survey.\n\nAs the disapproval from minority groups suggests, the rejection of the policy does not appear to be solely the product of prejudice. In the WGBH poll, 86 percent of respondents opined that campus diversity is at least a somewhat important goal. Similarly, in the \"Hidden Tribes\" polling, 81 percent of Americans believe there are serious problems of racism in the country, with 75 percent agreeing that acts of racism are at least somewhat common.\n\nIn short, there is a broad consensus among Americans that racism remains a problem and that campus diversity is important. Yet there is an even broader consensus that racial preferences in college admissions should not be the solution to that problem.\n\nOf course, the fact that only 15 percent of Americans support affirmative action policies at institutions like Harvard does not necessarily make these schools wrong. What is popular is not always right, and vice versa.\n\nHowever, it is fair to say that a position as unpopular as using racial preferences in college admissions should be considered a controversial, non-mainstream position. Instead, however, the public discussion of affirmative action, particularly in the media, tends to follow the tired convention that a \" controversial \" position is one held by conservatives, not by establishment journalism.\n\nThe New York Times , for example, will describe affirmative action in college admissions as \"a major - and highly contentious - legacy of the civil rights era, and one that white conservatives have opposed for decades.\" The broad and increasing unpopularity of the policy is rarely, if ever, news that's fit to print. The Washington Post's supposedly \"straight\" news coverage similarly insinuates that opposition to racial preferences is largely an exercise in white identity politics.\n\nWhen The Washington Post , NPR , or CNN publish features purporting to tell their readers what they need to know about racial preferences in education, somehow they never get around to mentioning that the vast majority of Americans now oppose them. Accounts of the dueling rallies ahead of the Harvard trial, from the Boston Globe to The Atlantic, similarly avoid this inconvenient truth. Instead, given the nature of the allegations against Harvard, it is common to find - from The New Yorker to Vox to Teen Vogue - articles by Asian-Americans defending racial preferences.\n\nThe effect of this extensive web of denial in American journalism is to completely invert the public discourse. The typical media consumer would tend to conclude racial preferences in education are not merely legal, but also broadly popular, opposed only by a narrow faction of closet Klansmen who run the Republican Party.\n\nIn reality, this distortion of public opinion empowers a small number of progressive activists, inside and outside the establishment media, in their attempt to short-circuit honest debate. If opponents of racial preferences can be dismissed with ad hominem attacks of racism or racial insensitivity, progressives are never required to answer the sorts of questions they otherwise would be required to face.\n\nThe initial question progressives get to avoid is why Americans now oppose racial preferences in education. Is it simply the moral sense that racial discrimination is wrong, even when the left might see it as benign? Is it the sense that such preferences often stigmatize their beneficiaries?\n\nProgressives would also be forced to answer questions about the efficacy of racial preferences. Do racial preferences mismatch minority students and schools in ways that set up students to fail? Do they stoke the growing grievance culture on American campuses? If schools like Harvard are using race as \"only one factor among many\" in the admissions process, why do they simultaneously argue that removing this marginal factor would have apocalyptic effects on campus diversity?\n\nIn a more honest debate, we would hear more from critical legal theorists like Randall Kennedy , who is skeptical of the social science rationale for diversity on campus and wonders how it can be a \"compelling state interest\" for legal purposes only \"so long as the demands and expectations imposed on it are not too onerous.\" Kennedy argues for affirmative action as a form of reparations - a rationale long rejected by the Supreme Court, but one far more consistent with the policy as originally promoted by President Lyndon B. Johnson .\n\nAs Joy Pullmann recently wrote: \"It says something about the left that they are not confident enough in their ideas to subject them to a free and open hearing aimed at honest persuasion, but instead seek to coerce people into compliance through political correctness and other social manipulations.\"\n\nPolitical correctness is the theory. The establishment's warped discussion of racial preferences is the practice.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

Joe Manchin declared he will vote against the For the People Act, an overreaching election reform bill, in what he says is a stand for bipartisanship.\n\nThe For the People Act is ostensibly about voting rights, but behind rosy marketing, the bill is an opportunity for Democrats to weaken election integrity and allow for manipulation along partisan lines.\n\nManchin told Fox News that while he supported much of the bill's content, a substantial number of provisions were unrelated to voting rights. \"It's the wrong piece of legislation to bring our country together and unite our country, and I'm not supporting that because I think it would divide us more,\" the West Virginia Democrat told Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"I don't want to be in a country that's divided any further.\"\n\nManchin further noted in an op-ed to the Charleston Gazette-Mail that the partisan nature of the bill influenced his decision to vote against it. He wrote:\n\nDemocrats in Congress have proposed a sweeping election reform bill called the For the People Act. This more than 800-page bill has garnered zero Republican support. Why? Are the very Republican senators who voted to impeach Trump because of actions that led to an attack on our democracy unwilling to support actions to strengthen our democracy? Are these same senators, whom many in my party applauded for their courage, now threats to the very democracy we seek to protect? The truth, I would argue, is that voting and election reform that is done in a partisan manner will all but ensure partisan divisions continue to deepen.\n\nManchin also doubled down on his defense of the filibuster, saying, \"Furthermore, I will not vote to weaken or eliminate the filibuster.\"\n\nThis decision to break with the party infuriated leftist media figures, politicians, activists, and blue checkmarks, who slammed the West Virginia senator.

      "text": "1619 Project founder complains that study proving liberal intolerance is being used to 'bolster claims of liberal intolerance'\n\n\"The problem [of] this survey is how it's being used to bolster claims of liberal intolerance,\" Hannah-Jones opined.\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones of The New York Times questioned the data brought forward by the free speech group FIRE because it validates the concerns about self-censorship that white people have, in addition to minorities.\n\n\"But the problem this survey is how it's being used to bolster claims of liberal intolerance,\" Hannah-Jones claims.\n\nI appreciate this FIRE post abt its campus climate survey,and I am corrected here that the survey does tell us how students of color and LQBTQ feel in this survey. But the problem this survey is how it's being used to bolster claims of liberal intolerance. https://t.co/WAR0LH77xH\n\nShe further says it's wrong that conservatives use this report to bolster their claims about college campuses being excessively liberal and \"too intolerant\" to handle. Hannah-Jones asserts that it's wrong for white conservatives to claim they are suffering, because students of all stripes experience the phenomenon.\n\nTo decode what Hannah-Jones is trying to say: she seems to believe white people and minorities can't both have this problem mutually. To her it's one or the other .\n\nThe reality of what the FIRE blog post points out is that students in the \"white,\" \"black,\" \"hispanic,\" and \"Asian\" blocs experience LESS feelings of self-censorship from their multiracial and American Indian counterparts.\n\nFIRE's analysis of the data reads: \"According to the survey, one in five [b]lack students report self-censoring 'fairly' or 'very' often, as do almost one in give Hispanic (18%) and Asian (17%) students. These percentages are higher for multiracial students (22%), American Indian students (25%), and students who identified their race/ethnicity as 'Something else' (32%). when it came to sexuality, students identifying as heterosexual/straight or as 'something else' self-censored most often.\"\n\nIt's only with the demographics of sexuality that Hannah-Jones can even begin to make the unilateral claims she asserted within her tweets. But even then it's straight people who feel compelled to self-censor beyond any other demographic.\n\nOtherwise things just don't match up.\n\nWhen it comes to the FIRE blog post, the organization attempts to address critique brought forward by Hannah-Jones. Which resulted from a New York Times op-ed by former FIRE intern Emma Camp.\n\nMany of these articles/columns site the same study but it's never been clear to me which type of students are self-censoring and which views. How do we know racial minorities or LQBTQ students or progressives are not included in this number? Truth is, we don't. pic.twitter.com/YzsLqxvQRL\n\nMuch of the group's response to feedback was a mix of saying people who were critical haven't taken a meaningful look at the data, alongside saying the parties involved in this discussion to begin with approaching the discussion from a purposefully sensible point of view.\n\n\"We don't just protect speech from the right. We don't just protect speech from the left. We defend protected speech, period,\" the post on FIRE reassures amid the claims by Hannah-Jones.\n\nIn support of that, FIRE points to how not only they've defended the likes of Mike Pence and Andy Ngo in the past, but also Hannah-Jones in her pursuit of a tenure at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nFIRE points to their openly available data for critics to review when making their observations and assessments.\n\nThe free speech group acknowledges both sides of the conversation. On one hand there's a student at Arizona State University who said they are \"scared to be openly transgender\" at their school given what they see as an overtly conservative climate.\n\nBut also: FIRE's rebuttal goes as far as taking a meaningful look at the question posed by Hannah-Jones. What kind of censorship do black and colored students face on campus?\n\nPeople who fit that demographic provide responses:\n\nBut when it comes to the general mission objectives as set forth by the body of work presented by Hannah-Jones, she's someone who in the past targeted those who questioned her. Beyond general episodes where Hannah-Jones responds poorly to feedback, the issue of school choice is particularly personal for her as of late.\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.
